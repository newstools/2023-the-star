Embakasi East MP Babu Owino now claims there are plans by the government to arrest him. Owino further alleged that charges will be fabricated in order to arraign him before a court of law. “Plans to arrest and fix trumped up charges against me is coming soon,” the vocal Opposition legislator said on Twitter. “Please don’t forget to add Msando’s murder, Baby Pendo’s murder and ICC witnesses’ murder. I also offer to carry ICC’s crimes against humanity. It’s always a pleasure to be a client of the Judiciary.” However, the MP-a die-hard supporter of Azimio leader Raila Odinga- did not hint at the possible charges he will face or the time or day he thinks he will be arrested. Owino is a staunch supporter of Raila and there are no doubts that he can take a bullet for the former Prime Minister. He has been vocal at Azimio rallies called by Raila to protest against President William Ruto’s administration. Owino has been claiming Raila had won the elections and even calling on retired President Uhuru Kenyatta to protect his win. "Baba has won the elections just protect his win. What’s the point of Kenyans voting if we rig out the winner?" Owino. On December 14, 2021, Owino was acquitted of attempted murder charges after a DJ he shot in January 2020 withdrew the case. Felix Orinda commonly known as DJ Evolve told the court through his lawyer that he did not wish to proceed with the matter. In his ruling, Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi said although the court was not involved in the negotiations, Owino was taking certain obligations towards the welfare of DJ Evolve who had agreed on an out-of-court settlement.
