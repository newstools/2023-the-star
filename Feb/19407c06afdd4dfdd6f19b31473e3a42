A tweet alleging that the government will use Hustler Fund borrowers to identify tax evaders is FALSE. In the tweet, Nyamweya Collo says that the moment one puts their M-PESA pin while borrowing a loan, the fund officials go through the M-PESA statement and they eventually learn how one files their returns. “Naskia government wants to use the hustler fund to identify Kenyans that are not tax compliant. Apparently when you give it access to your mpesa pin it goes through your mpesa statement and they crossover with how you file returns,” the tweet says. The correct position is the PIN is required to authenticate the owner of the Hustler Fund account where the loan will be disbursed. In a Frequently Asked Question portal in the Hustler Fund, the official said that all data privacy rules will be applied during the loan application. "PIN yako, siri yako."
