Parts of the country will receive rain in the next seven days, the latest forecast by the Kenya Meteorological Department shows. In the seven-day forecast for February 21-27, the weatherman said the rains will be concentrated in the Rift Valley and Lake Basin during the period under review. "Rainfall expected over some parts of the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, Lake Victoria Basin, South Rift Valley and isolated areas of the Highlands East of the Rift Valley," the update read in part. The rains will range from 10-50 mm in areas such as Bungoma, Busia, Siaya, Kakamega, Narok, Migori, Bomet, Kericho, Nandi, Nyamira, Kisii and Vihiga. "The rest of the country is expected to remain generally sunny and dry," it added. The rains will come as a huge relief to residents of the areas mentioned considering sweltering temperatures has been the order of the day over the past few months. So much was the heat that the Kenya Red Cross issued an advisory asking Kenyans to drink plenty of water even when not thirsty. The organisation cautioned against wearing of heavy outfits and advised people to shelter under trees or use umbrellas when out in the sun. In Monday's weather update, Kenya Met said high temperatures will continue to be high in areas that will not experience rains during the forecast period. "Average daytime temperatures are likely to be more than 30°C over most parts of the country except the Highlands East of the Rift Valley, Lake Victoria Basin and parts of South-eastern lowlands where temperatures are expected to be moderate (20-30°C)," the weatherman said in a statement. The forecast said nighttime temperatures in the areas mentioned are likely to be less than 10°C.
