President William Ruto has announced he will lead the country to a prayer service on February 14 at Nyayo Stadium over drought and hunger. Speaking during the interdenominational service in Nakuru, Ruto said the agenda will be to pray for rain and watch over the country. "For those who will not be able to make it to Nyayo Stadium, have services anywhere and pray for the country," he said. He also said his government has set aside seeds and fertilisers for agriculture, but all plans cannot go well if God doesn't provide rain. "We need God in order to move forward," he said. The prayers will be held between 8:00 am and 4:00 pm, religious leaders are also expected to attend. In November 2022, the President allocated an additional Sh2 billion to help with the drought situation around the country. He termed the drought as the ‘worst’ in four decades. The government with support from the private sector planned to contribute an estimated Sh10 billion shillings to boost drought response in the affected counties. The money was to be spent towards the purchase of medical supplies for malnourished families, food for both animals and people and also addressing the country's water challenges. The government also targets to increase irrigation land to 1.8 million acres from the current 350 acres. “Our target within the next five years is to hit 1.8 million acres. If we get good support in terms of investors, the way we are marketing it, we could do up to 3 million acres,” Water CS Alice Wahome said. Counties in the drought alarm phase are Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu, Isiolo, Laikipia, Garissa, Tana River, Mandera, Wajir, Kitui and Kajiado.
