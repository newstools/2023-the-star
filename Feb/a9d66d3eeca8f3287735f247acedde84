Two employees of the now moribund Nairobi Metropolitan Service on Friday appeared before a Nairobi court to defend themselves against accusations of stealing three infants. The infants were aged eight days, two weeks and two months respectively. They were stolen from the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital. This, according to the prosecution, happened on diverse dates between March and November 2020. During the mention, the court heard that one of the accused persons will give unsworn evidence, while his co-accused said she will provide sworn evidence on the same. They were arrested after an investigation story showed them on camera receiving money for the baby theft deal. During the investigation, the two, unknowingly helped the crew and undercover police officers to buy the babies from the hospital.
