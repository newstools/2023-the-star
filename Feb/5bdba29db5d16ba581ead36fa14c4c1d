Fresh from winning his maiden national cross country championships title, Charles Lokir said he is now preparing for the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary. Lokir said he plans to use this weekend's Sirikwa Classic World Athletics Cross Country Tour at the Lobo Village in Kapseret, Uasin Gishu County. Lokir, who also won the North Rift Athletics Kenya region title during the regional championships in Maralal, Samburu County  said: "I want to register better results this year." "I know it will be a very competitive race but I have been training well for the race. I was fifth during last year's edition and I want to improve on this by finishing in the podium places." Speaking during Sunday's Discovery Kenya Cross Country Championships at the Eldoret Sports Club, Lokir said winning the national title was a good thing but he cannot celebrate for long. Instead, he said this will only serve as inspiration to train harder. “Winning the national cross country for the first time was a motivation for me and my career. This means I will have to work harder to remain at the top and i am certain this is possible," he added. Lokir said his mission is to represent the country at the World Championships in Budapest to atone for his failures at the 2019 World Cross Country in Aarhus, Denmark, where he finished a disappointing 15th. “I ran very well at the national trials, finishing third, but I could only manage a 15th-place finish in Denmark. It was disappointed but that in the nature of competition,” said Lokir, who was accompanied by his coach Daniel Ng’eitch.. He observed that Sirikwa Classic will test him accordingly as he targets a slot in the Team Kenya 10, 000m category. “I want to compete in 10,00m at the world championships in Budapest. It has been a while since Kenya won gold in this race and I want to try my luck,” he concluded.
