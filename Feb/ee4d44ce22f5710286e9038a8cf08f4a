Former Soy MP Caleb Kositany has dismissed claims that he has been appointed US ambassador. In a statement, the legislator pointed out that government appointments have official procedures that they do follow. "Government appoints through a gazette notice, ignore the rumour," he said. Kositany served as the Soy Member of Parliament between 2017-2022. In 2022, he was seeking to run for the Uasin Gishu gubernatorial post but lost during the UDA nominations to Jonathan Bii who is the current governor.
