Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has announced plans of renaming Mutuini hospital. Speaking on Tuesday at Mama Lucy  Hospital, he said the plans are to rename it to First Lady Rachel Ruto. "We will be bringing a motion to rename it to Mama Rachel Ruto Mutuini hospital," he said. Mutuini will not be the first hospital to be renamed after a first lady. Last year, the then Nairobi Metropolitan Services renamed Mathare- Korogocho after former First lady, Margaret Kenyatta. The hospital is now called  Mama Margaret Uhuru Hospital. Renaming of roads and streets in Nairobi has caused an uproar with some even ejecting the posts bearing the name. With the uproar, NMS decided to develop a policy for naming and renaming streets and roads in the capital. Nairobi has no policy on naming streets, roads, or buildings. According to the Nairobi City County Property Addressing and Street Naming Policy (Pasnap) aims for a transparent and predictable procedure for naming and renaming. It aims to improve the ease of doing business and movement, particularly e-commerce growth and development. "Pasnap will create a culture of identifying streets and buildings." Nairobi lacks a framework for harmoniously addressing property and street names, especially because e-commerce deliveries require street names. Some roads and streets, including those in new estates and subdivisions, are unnamed. The policy currently before the assembly discourages renaming, saying it should only be a last resort and only in two specific conditions. First, if there is duplication. Then the first name remains, and the second one is changed. Second, if the name is offensive or names a person, group, company or institution that has fallen into disrepute or breached Constitution Chapter Six on integrity.
