A tweet by Lawyer Miguna Miguna that President William Ruto has travelled out of the country more than 15 times since his inauguration is false. President Ruto was inaugurated on September 13, 2022, and has since traveled out of the country several times. Miguna on November 23, 2022, at 8:49 am, posted a tweet purporting that Ruto has been out of the country 15 times since his inauguration. “President William Ruto is in South Korea on a state visit. He has traveled out of Kenya more than 15 times since his inauguration. Please Kenyans, allow General Miguna Miguna to exercise his rights and travel out and into the country whenever necessary. Freedom is here! Viva!,” Miguna tweeted. The fact-checker has, however, established that President Ruto has not traveled out of the country 15 times but six times by the time this publication was made. The first visit was to London, United Kingdom, to attend the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on September 19. On  October 8 he met with Uganda President Yoweri Museveni in Uganda. He later went on a two-day visit to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where he met President Samia Samia Suluhu on October 10. On  November 6 he jetted to Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt for the COP27 conference. President Ruto went to South Korea for bilateral talks on November 23. President on December 13 left for the United States to attend the US-Africa Leaders' summit.
