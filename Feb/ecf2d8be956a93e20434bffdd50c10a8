Bungoma-based Rangers are keen to upset second-placed Ulinzi Sharks when the two sides collide in a Kenya Handball Federation encounter at Nyayo Stadium this weekend. Coach Reagan Makona said his charges, who are fourth with 23 points, have trained well for the match and anything short of maximum points in their two fixtures in the capital will be a major disappointment. “We are thoroughly prepared for the two away matches. We are coming to the city for all points. We are not afraid of Sharks. Last year we gave them a tough time, losing by just six goals,” said Makona, whose side is also scheduled to play Amazon. A win for Rangers will see them move above both Sharks and third-placed National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). The two giants all have 24 points each. In the other women’s fixtures, reigning champions and the only unbeaten side so far, Nairobi Water Queens, are banking on Gladys Chilo and Brenda Ariviza in their clash against lowly New Hope. Hope are 10th on the log with just one win. NCPB, with Sarah Mabonga on scoring form, tackle Rising Star — who are 11th while Nairobi City County play Rising Star in a bottom-of-the-table clash. The men fixtures will see second-placed Ulinzi meet Rangers. The soldiers will tie with champions NCPB on 30 points with a victory. General Service Unit, who are fourth on 22 points, confront Buccaneers who are seventh and eyeing a top six finish and NCC, A a win will push them above third placed Black Mamba and Strathmore University into third position. On Sunday, Rangers square it off with Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology before winding their tour against Technical University of Kenya.
