The former World Under-20 400m finalist Kennedy Kimeu and sprinter Moses Wasike are seeking to qualify for the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest Hungary and the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. The two set their targets to feature in major events after recording victories at the Athletics Kenya (AK) track and field weekend meeting at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu. Kimeu, who was the team captain for  Team Kenya during the 2021 World Under -20 Championships, said he wants to run well and secure a slot for Budapest in August. “I know nothing will come easy and I am aware I will need to really focus on my training to achieve my goal,” he said. To achieve his goal, Kimeu said his focus is to lower his time and ensure he qualifies for the World Championships. “Mine is not a race against opponents but against time. I want to meet the qualifying standards because I want to compete at the World Championships and if possible at the Olympic Games,” he said. He said he believes this is the time to stay focused if he is to realize his dream. “I also want to appreciate my coach and family who have been very supportive during my training,” he said. Kimeu won the one-lap race after timing 46.8 ahead of Allan Kipyego (47.3) and Gilbert Nyamau (47.5), who completed the podium during the AK Kisumu meeting over the weekend. Wasike on his part said his focus is to run sub-10 seconds this season to give him a chance. “Right now, my body has been responding well and I hope I will soon realize my dream,” said Wasike. Like Kimeu,  Wasike said his main target is to qualify for a major championship.
