The court will today hear the mitigation of former Venezuelan first secretary Dwight Sagaray who was found guilty of murdering the late envoy Olga Fonseca. Justice Roselyne Korir will deliver a sentence against Saragay and three others who were also found guilty. Dwight was arraigned at the Milimani Law Courts in 2012 and charged with the murder of Fonseca. He was charged alongside Ahmed Omindo, Alex Sifuna, Moses Kiprotich and Kirui Chelogoi. Another suspect Mohamed Ahmed Hassan was never captured and warrants of his arrest remain unexecuted to date. Fonseca was found murdered in her Runda residence in Nairobi. She was strangled to death on July 26, 2012, less than two weeks after arriving in Kenya to head the diplomatic mission. Olga's body was found lying on her bed with a wire cord around her neck, hands and legs. In her judgement, Trial Judge Roselyn Korir said the state had proved their case against the accused persons apart from Chelogoi who was acquitted. The prosecution presented an array of witnesses, 37 in total and produced 39 exhibits that were used to pin down the four. Korir said the evidence produced in court by the prosecution demonstrated there was an outright conflict between Olga and Dwight. The court was able to deduce the hostile and acrimonious relationship between the two through the evidence from the embassy staff. "I have found their evidence to be credible. They narrated what they saw and experienced. They have no interest in siding with either party," said the Judge. Olga's arrival, according to the evidence produced, was not only resented by Mohamed and Dwight but also by some of the staff members. The Court also observed that Olga would from time to time complain about the living conditions and disrespect from the staff.
