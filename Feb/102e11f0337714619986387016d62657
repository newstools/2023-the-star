We prepared accordingly for this clash, said KCB head coach Japheth Munala after leading the bankers to a 3-0 win over Kenya Defence Forces  in their opening match of the Kenya Volleyball Federation league at the Nyayo Stadium. The bankers won 25-14, 25-19 and 25-18 as Elizabeth Lemosiany, Esther Mutinda and Faith Cherotich made their debuts. In the opening set, Munala started his preferred six players, featuring Malkia Strikers mainstay Mercy Moim, captain Edith Wisa, libero Lincy Jeruto, Miriam Wamaitha, Shirleen Maiywa and Immaculate Nekesa. Munala said: “KDF is a team we know very well, we prepared accordingly for this clash and as you saw, we were dangerous offensively with Juliana Namutira and Mercy Moim causing all sorts of problems to our opponents. “I am proud of the entire team for their collective effort and we now await our next opponents in the next leg.” However, Munala was concerned with how Moim and Wisa gave away free points in their services, a department he has promised to work on. “Our first set was crucial in setting the tone of how the game would go but we are still struggling,” added Munala. “As we head back to training next week, we need to improve this aspect of our game so that we do not give away points cheaply.” Kenya Prisons were also triumphant, hitting fellow wardresses, Nairobi Prisons, 3-0 (25-12, 25-16 and 25-18). The Josp Barasa-tutored side had beaten Vihiga by the same scoreline on Saturday. Returnees Post Bank also got the best of Vihiga in a dominant 3-1 (25-19, 23-25, 25-16 and 25-21.
