Former Education CS George Magoha's granddaughter Barbara Aloo Mogoho has eulogised him as a man who made her stylish. Three-year-old Barbara recounted how Magoha bought her dresses which earned her compliments on how stylish she was. "Thank you for loving me so much, for playing with me until you were bone tired, for pushing me around on my bike and for all those days we spent together just you and I," Barbara said. "I get a lot of comments about how stylish I am grandpa, and I know where I got that from! Thank you for all the dresses and for making me just as stylish as you are." She said her grandfather was present to receive her three years ago at the hospital when she was born. "Dear Kwara, I came into this world about three years ago on a Friday at exactly 4.26 pm. Kwara, you were at the hospital at exactly 4:00 pm eagerly awaiting my arrival. You were one of the first people I met on this earth and one of those who loved me the most," she eulogised. Magoha's granddaughter said that she celebrated his 70th birthday by singing, playing with balloons and eating cake and candy. "Sorry for all the nights I kept you awake, but deep down I know you loved every minute of it because you always woke up with a smile when you saw me beside you," Barbara said. "I will never forget you grandpa, and I thank God that I started my life on such a high note with you as my grandfather. The three years we spent together will be cherished as some of the best years of my long life to come." Magoha died on January 24, at the Nairobi Hospital surrounded by his family and loved ones following a cardiac arrest. On Thursday, family and friends hold a  requiem mass at the Consolata Shrine.
