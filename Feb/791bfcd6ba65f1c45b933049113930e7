Maxi dresses are a fashion trend that most petite women shy away from due to the challenges of pulling them off effectively. Maxi dresses are versatile and can be worn in a variety of occasions and settings. All body shapes can rock a maxi dress, by choosing the right length and style. Here is how to rock a maxi dress Watch your length When choosing a maxi dress for any occasion ensure it is the right length for your height, and body shape. They can be floor-length or somewhere between your ankles and the top of your feet. Look for a great neckline Go for a neckline that fits your upper body well, and is comfortable. It can be a deep v-neck to elongate your upper body, for short ladies it creates the illusion of height. It can also be strapless or spaghetti straps. Wear the right bra depending on the design of your dress. Choose a maxi with a structure This will depend greatly on your body shape and the features you would like to accentuate. If you want to create the illusion of long legs you can opt for empire waist dresses, if your dress does not have it then wear a belt to create it. Be picky with bold patterns This is especially for ladies with a thin frame. Large prints dominate your body and create an odd look. Bold patterns will be too thick for you. But there are those that you can pull off and those that you cannot. Instead of bold patterns, you can opt for solid colours and monochromatic looks. Accessorize your dress with the right earrings, necklace, rings, shoes, bangles, and even cover-up or jacket for a cold day.
