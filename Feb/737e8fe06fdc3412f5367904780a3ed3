Zimbabweans Robson Chinhoi, Nyasha Muyambo and Visitor Mapwanya have taken the top three positions on the Safari Tour as the series concluded at the par 71 Muthaiga Golf Club on Wednesday. Mapwanya upset Kenyan professionals after rolling three under par 68 for a total of three under par 281 in the four-day tournament. He edged out Round Three leader Greg Snow, who fired two under par 69 for a total of two under par 282, same as Great Rift’s Jastas Madoya. Mapwanya's 68 was good enough to starve off Snow, Round Two leader Mutahi Kibugu and Round One leader Samuel Njoroge in the 54-hole tournament. Mapwanya rolled a single birdie in the opening nine with all pars to collect 35 gross but his second nine paid off, despite firing a bogey in the 14th. He had three birdies in the 10th, 13th and 18th. “A birdie in the 18th hole saved me after struggling in a number of holes in today’s round,” said Mapwanya. His win helped compatriot Chinhoi dislodge series defending champion Snow. Muyambo finished second overall with Mapwanya completing the top three positions.
