Bungoma governor Ken Lusaka has trashed a report that was released by the Controller of Budget listing him among governors miss-spending county funds made for development in counties. Governors: Simba Arati (Kisii), Kawira Mwangaza (Meru), Issa Timamy (Lamu), Wavinya Ndeti (Machakos), Ochilo Ayacko (Migori), Susan Kihika (Nakuru), Kimani Wamatangi (Kiambu), Julius Malombe (Kitui), Ken Lusaka (Bungoma) and Mutula Kilonzo (Makueni) have been exposed by the CoB for miss-spending public funds. Lusaka spoke at Bumula grounds on Monday during the launch of the free fertilizer drive. He said the controller of the budget is misleading people saying that in Bungoma, he (Lusaka) hit the ground running once he was sworn in as the county boss. “The CoB should release factual, clear and timely reports to the residents so that people can be aware of what goes on in the country,” Lusaka added. Lusaka argues the recurrent expenditure has gone high in Bungoma because the county has workers that he got in the systems when he assumed office. “When I assumed office after, I found a huge number of workers in the county including those of local authorities, I can’t just wake up one day and chase them, it needs a procedure,” Lusaka said. The Ford Kenya governor called on the Controller of the budget to revive the reports before publishing them to the public. However, Lusaka said that every ward in Bungoma will receive 500 bags of fertilizers saying that it will go a long way in helping the small-scale farmers increase their production.
