Approximately 15 acres of tea plantation were on Tuesday evening destroyed after a fire ravaged the Menenagi tea estate in Limuru. The fire, according to witnesses, was started by a lit cigarette butt which was disposed of near the farm. Strong winds fanning the fire made it challenging to put it out, resulting in the loss of millions worth of tea leaves. Kiambu fire department arrived at the estate in three hours to contain the fires. Kiambu Governor Kimani Wamatangi warned residents against lighting fires near plantations, pointing out that the strong winds and current climate may act as a catalyst for the spread. "There is a day we were fighting nine fires in one day at the same time. What is happening is because we have this drought and you can see what is happening. Any little spark causes a fire," he said. "We are ready to fight the fire. What we are telling our people is please be careful."
