Football Kenya Federation are expected to receive approximately USD8 million (Sh1bn) from Fifa for football development and operational support. This follows the approval of Fifa's 2022 Annual Report highlighting the world football governing body's record‑breaking revenue of USD7.6 billion (Sh954bn) during the 2019‑2022 cycle and the USD11 billion (Sh1.3tn) expected to be earned during the 2023‑2026 period. The grants to member associations signifies a 29 per cent increase from the previous cycle. “Fifa’s unprecedented investment in football is the result of our solid financial transparency and stands as a concrete example of how we are aiming to make football truly global,” said Fifa President Gianni Infantino. “The launch of Fifa Forward 3.0 means that we can do so by providing support for development projects, hand-in-hand with the six Confederations and the 211 Fifa Member Associations. Over this four-year cycle, there will be an increase in investment in Forward of 29 per cent compared to the previous period, and that means that solidarity payments have now increased by a factor of seven in the space of just seven years.” Fifa secretary general Fatma Samoura commended the inaugural Africa Schools champion cup that was held in Congo in 2022. “It was my pleasure to be at Kinshasa’s Stade des Martyrs in February to witness the inaugural staging of the Africa Schools Champions Cup, organised by Fifa with support from CAF and the African Union,” said Samoura. “For many of the players, their journey was the first outside their own country, an occasion on which to learn and make new friends through the beautiful game. Our belief in football’s place at the heart of education is unwavering.” The Fifa council confirmed the inaugural 32-team club World Cup in the summer of 2025 will feature four African clubs, four from Asia, four from the Concacaf region, six from South America, one from Oceania, 12 from Europe and one as a tournament host.
