Former Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungiâ€™s Devolution Empowerment Party, popularly known as Mbus is likely to turn into a shell of its former self as some ardent supporters declare their support for Governor Kawira Mwangaza. Since former Meru chief of staff Gideon Kimathi shifted his allegiance in favor of Governor Mwangaza it seems the Mbus party is on a downward trend. On January 27, former Meru county assembly majority leader Victor Karithi followed suit and had a handshake with Mwangaza. The same day, Igoji political leaders led by Gwara Gwara Nkosi and former Meru Woman Rep Florence Kajuju separately paid Mwangaza a courtesy call. Kiraitu who boosts of being the longest-serving politician in Kenya before his defeat to Mwangaza has declared he will not run for any political seat in future Mwangaza has been receiving business people and ambassadors since her failed impeachment bid against her.
