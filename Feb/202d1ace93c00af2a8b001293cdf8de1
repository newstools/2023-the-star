Youth Alive Kenya and Oxfam Kenya are calling for the ratification of the convention on decent work for domestic workers. They want minimum labour protections for domestic workers guaranteed, as Kenya was a signatory to the convention. The International Labour Organisation Convention 189 (ILOC189) was held in 2011. "The reality of many informal workers in Kenya including domestic workers is that they have no union bodies, government policies or tax regulations to protect them," they said. They said that domestic workers' rights need to be at par with other categories of workers while allowing for considerable flexibility in implementation. The Convention on Domestic Workers, formally the Convention concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers was a convention setting labour standards for domestic workers. It was recommended during the conference that countries implement measures to ensure domestic workers have decent work. The groups made the request during the Women Economic Empowerment Conference 2023 held in Nairobi on Friday. The conference brought together unpaid care workers and domestic workers in Kenya. They include female taxi drivers, caregivers, community health volunteers, mama mbogas, bar hostesses and many others. They said that ratification of C189 goes beyond having policy documents. "It has a direct implementation on the livelihoods of domestic workers within and outside the country," they said. The conference is hoping to set a basis for advocacy activities toward achieving equal labour rights for domestic workers in the country.
