Retired president Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga will on Saturday afternoon address Azimio rallies in Western Kenya. The two leaders, who are currently attending the burial of former Education Cabinet secretary George Magoha, will address roadside rallies later Saturday. According to the ODM party, Uhuru and Raila will make stopovers in Luanda market and Kisumu town after Magoha's burial. "President Uhuru Kenyatta and PM Raila Odinga who have just attended the funeral of prof. George Magoha in Yala are expected to address roadside rallies at Luanda market in Vihiga county and Kisumu shortly," ODM party twitted. Earlier when he spoke at the funeral Uhuru described Raila as his party leader and brother, affirming his place in Azimio. This would be the first joint Azimio rallies by both Uhuru and Raila following their defeat in the August 9, General Election. Raila has been holding public rallies which he has described as public Barazas to reportedly consult them on the next actions after their victory was 'stolen'. On Friday, Raila held a rally in Mavoko, Machakos county attended by top Azimio leaders including Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka. More rallies are planned this week as the former prime minister builds what he has termed as resistance against President Ruto's administration.
