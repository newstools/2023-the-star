In the month of love, it doesn't hurt to add a little spice to your outlook and that of your significant other. When going out on a date, dressing up in matching outfits is a growing trend that you may need to consider. However, you don't need to match every thing from head to toe. You can even wear totally different outfits but match the colour, head gear, shoes or hair style. Even though some quarters argue that couples who match outfits are outdated or show-offs, doing this is a cute way of showing everyone that you are a couple. So, don't shy away from matching colours or coordinating patterns  in some way. More often than not, women take the initiative to adopt a “pair look". And as such, for your man to suggest that you match your outfit will likely make him happy. There are plenty of ways to match outfits with your significant other besides the popular custom printed T-shirts with names at the back. You can match accessories as well to create a coordinated look. You don’t have to go all out; simply match your tie's colour to that of her blouse. You can also match shoes, belt, waist bags or even the hair. Couples who don dreadlocks can explore the pairing look by styling their dreads the same way. Outfits such as full suits, Ankara suits or two-piece outfits can be mixed and matched with tonnes of different bottoms, knits and accessories, so that the look can be complementary without being identical. These days, its pretty common to see couples attending social functions such as weddings wearing designed Ankara outfits. Men are usually in African or Ankara shirt while women go with Ankara dresses. Some go to the extreme and match even the type and colour of shoes. Young and new couples can easily start out with matching trousers or tees. They can also explore matching hoodies or bomber jackets. With time, it becomes a trend and both of you will always look forward to days when you'll match outfits.
