Lawyer Ahmednasir  Abdullahi has inquired about CCTV cameras footages of former Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i ’s home following an alleged raid on Wednesday night. Through his Twitter handle, Ahmednasir requested proof that the attempted raid on Matiang’i had happened, questioning if this was a false alarm from those affiliated with the previous government. “Did the orphans of the Uhuru regime scared of their yesteryear sins trigger a false alarm that Dr Matiangí house was raided? Where are the videos from the CCTV cameras and the lawyers on the scene?” he posed. His request came after the police, EACC, and ARA denied their involvement in the said raid. Speaking on Thursday Inspector General of police Japhet Koome said he was not aware of the operation. “There is no officer under the National Police Service who was at the former CS home. We have checked and I can confirm,” he said. Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission chief executive officer Twalib Mbarak concurred with Koome denying the involvement of his officers. “We are not aware. Those, if any are not EACC officers. We have nothing against him,” he said. ARA officials also refuted claims of their involvement. “Those could be imposters if any. We don’t conduct raids and searches at night,” a senior ARA official said.
