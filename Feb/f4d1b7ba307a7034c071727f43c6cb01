Trade CS Moses Kuria has revealed that he engaged in talks with Kenyatta University Vice Chancellor Prof Paul Wainaina on the China Square. Chine Square is located at Unicity mall Thika road. In the past few days, it has taken shoppers by storm attracting criticism from local traders. The square has the most affordable items, according to Kenyans on social media; all you could want at cheaper prices. Kuria in a statement on Friday made it clear that as much as the country welcomes Chinese investors, they were here as manufacturers, not traders. During his talks with Wainaina, Kuria advised him to buy the Square and hand it over to local traders. "I have today given an offer to Prof Wainaina the VC Kenyatta University to buy out the lease for China Square, Unicity Mall and hand it over to the Gikomba, Nyamakima, Muthurwa l& Eastleigh Traders Association," he said. "We welcome Chinese investors to Kenya but as manufacturers, not traders."
