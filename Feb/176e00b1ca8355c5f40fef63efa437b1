Singer Bahati says he missed an opportunity to feature on the Netflix reality show 'Young, Famous and African' because he was busy with politics. When he was needed to go and shoot, he was vying for a political seat, he said. "I was supposed to be on the second season of 'Young, Famous and African'. We went through the run and everything. "They wanted me to shoot between July and August. It was election time," he said. "That was one of the things I missed. God's timing is the best." The show, whose first season was majorly shot in South Africa, featured Diamond Platnumz, Zari Hassan, Khanyi Mbau, 2face Idibia and his wife Anne Idibia. Bahati had his own reality TV show, 'Being Bahati', two years ago.
