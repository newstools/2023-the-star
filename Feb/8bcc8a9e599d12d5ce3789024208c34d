President William Ruto has commended religious organisations for their role in the provision of social services. He said the government appreciated their contribution to the provision of health and education among other issues. Speaking on Tuesday when he met health and education representatives of religious organisations at the State House, Ruto committed to continuing being partners. The leaders were led by Anglican Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit, Mombasa Catholic Archbishop Martin Kivuva, Bishop Robert Lang'at of the Africa Gospel Church and PCEA Moderator Thigu Mutahi. The governmentÂ pledged to work with the institutions to deliver efficient and cost-effective health services as well as relevant education. "The institutions provide 40 per cent healthcare in Kenya and must be core in our plan and roll out of the Universal Health Care programme," Ruto said. Singling out the responsibility religious groups and leaders have in instilling values in schools and colleges, Ruto pointed out that their responsibility in running educational institutions is guaranteed. He urged the leaders to partner with the government and other stakeholders in the fight against drugs, alcohol and other vices affecting the youth. "On matters social, on matters moral, you have more leverage than the government. Alcohol and drugs have permeated our society and it is hurting our youth and leaders," the Head of State said.
