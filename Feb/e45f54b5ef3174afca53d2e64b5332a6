Claims that President William Ruto's daughter, Charlene Ruto donated her old underwear to Kenya Kwanza supporters is false. A user of a Facebook page, named National Democratic Advocate - Kenya had alleged that Charlene donated her old underwear to hustlers. In the photo shared by National Democratic Advocate - Kenya, Charlene is seen holding reusable sanitary pads, with two other ladies holding panties. The correct position is Charlene had met with a team from Be Girl Organization who create sustainable hygiene products, and was not donating any products at the time. Taking to her Twitter account, Charlene said the organization is committed to enhancing and improving period care is embraced globally. "Towards the end of last year, we met the team from Be Girl Org who create sustainable hygiene products like reusable pads, period panties & menstrual cups. "Their commitment to enhancing and improving period care is being embraced globally. Would you use a menstrual cup? #periodcare ," she tweeted.
