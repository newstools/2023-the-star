Forty-eight per cent of Kenyans are dissatisfied with the direction Kenya is taking to reform the school curriculum, the latest survey shows. The study conducted between November 3 and November 17, 2022, by Twaweza’s Sauti za Mwananchi, however, indicates that 36 per cent prefer the CBC over the 8-4-4 system. The survey, ‘What we teach our children: Kenyan citizens’ experiences and opinions on curriculum reforms’ was conducted among 3,000 respondents. It was conducted via a mobile-phone panel survey through random sampling from a database of contacts from previous surveys. According to the findings, only four per cent of Kenyans have never heard about CBC. “Half (47 per cent) say the CBC is better while four out of ten (38 per cent) say the previous “8-4-4” system is better,” the study says. About nine per cent of the respondents feel the two education systems are the same. When asked about the challenges facing the implementation of CBC, the respondents listed the financial cost and its time demand as the main issues with 74 per cent saying it is very costly while 42 per cent feel that it is too demanding on parents. “Other challenges cited include teachers that are not well trained in teaching the CBC at 14 per cent while 12 per cent think that children get complicated assignments. Ten per cent said the implementation is not clear while another seven per cent cited confusion over where children should go for junior high school. “The most widely-proposed change put forward by citizens for how the CBC could be improved is to reduce the cost to parents, cited by half (54 per cent) of citizens,” the survey says. “Other suggestions include making resources and equipment more widely available (23 per cent), reducing the involvement of parents (19 per cent), building the capacity of teachers (10%) and reducing the workload on learners (10 per cent).” From the survey, one out of six citizens (17 per cent) suggests the CBC should be dropped entirely.
