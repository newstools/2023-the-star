Vihiga Queens will assess four players before making a decision on their inclusion in the matchday squad for this weekend's Women's Premier League match against Nakuru City Queens on Sunday, coach Boniface Nyamunyamu has said. The defending champions take on Nakuru at the Mumias Sports Complex eager to maintain their one-point lead at the top of the standings. Nyamunyamu said Ruth Kasoa, Janet Moraa, Diana Tembesi and Anne Norah have shaken off their injuries and have returned to light training, though individually. "The four are training individually. They are not ready to join the rest of the squad. We are keeping an eye on their progress but we will make a decision in the last training session," said Nyamunyamu. But in a major boost, the trio of Philisters Kadari, Maureen Achieng and Merceline Wayodi are back to full training and will be involved. "We are depleted at the moment and that is part of the reason we have lost some matches. We hope they don't suffer any setback in their recovery," Nyamunyamu added.
