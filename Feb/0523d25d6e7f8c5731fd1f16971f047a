Azimio leader Raila Odinga on Thursday psyched his supporters to turn up for Friday's public rally in Mavoko in Machakos county hours after leading MPs at a parliamentary retreat at Maanzoni Lodge. The Mavoko rally is part of several others lined up over the weekend as the ODM leader and his troops scale up their revolt against President Williasm Ruto and the Kenya Kwanza regime. "Tukutane Masaku kesho. Kitaeleweka! (Let's meet in Machakos tomorrow," Raila said. Kitaeleweka is a political slogan which connotes the ability to be bold and daring in articulating one's sentiments. Raila said that after the Mavoko rally, the anti-Ruto rallies will head to Busia on Sunday and wind up the weekend with another rally in Kisii town on Monday. During Sunday's rally at Kamukunji in Kibra, Raila unveiled a new youth movement called Movement for Defence of Democracy, perhaps to send a signal of an unstoppable showdown. At the center of the Raila-Ruto clash is Ruto's insistence on payment of taxes, the high cost of living, the planned recruitment of new IEBC commissioners and alleged rigging of the August polls. Raila insists that he won the election with 8.1 million votes against Ruto's 5.9 million and has termed the Ruto presidency as illegitimate. "The information available in whistleblower's report has authentic original results from 245 constituencies, it shows that Mr William Ruto got 4.6 million votes. and we got 7.1 million votes. If you add the 45 that were not transmitted electronically plus Disapora, Ruto gets 5.9 million votes and we get 8.1 millions," Raila said during the retreat. "We must continue to have these barazas to sensitise our people of their democratic right which has been stolen. These people know that they stole elections and they want to rule you as if the won elections," he added.
