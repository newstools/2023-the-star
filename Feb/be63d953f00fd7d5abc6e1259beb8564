KCB head coach Japeth Munala says they want to make a statement of intent when the new Kenya Volleyball Federation season begins at the Nyayo Stadium this weekend. The bankers resumed training immediately after their 3-2 loss to Kenya Pipeline in last season's playoffs in January as they prepare to reclaim the national title and defend the continental trophy in May in Tunisia. “We are eager to go this weekend. The girls are in high spirits and everyone on the team is ready for the new season. Our loss against Kenya Pipeline was devastating but that is now past us,” said Munala. “As we start the new league season, we want to make a statement right from the onset." The reigning African Club champions open their campaign against Kenya Army on Saturday before playing Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) on Sunday afternoon. Speaking during a training session at ABSA Sports Club, KCB captain Edith Wisa said: “I urge all our fans to turn out in large numbers on Saturday and Sunday.” “We have been working on the mistakes that cost us the title last year and I can assure our fans that we are at a much better place, technically and physically.” “We want to take every match at a time and stamp our authority once again as the continental giants,” she concluded. New additions the bankers' squad include Elizabeth Lemosiany, Juliana Namutira, Faith Cherotich and Pauline Chemutai.
