Kakamega County government is set to step up the ward-based bursary fund from the current Sh120 million to Sh240 million. This will translate into Sh4 million per each of the 60 Wards in Kakamega County from the current Ksh. 2 Million. While presenting a cheque worth Sh12 million for the Wrads in Lurambi constituency at the Kakamega County Polytechnic on Monday, Kakamega Governor Fernandes Barasa said the increase will be effected in the next financial year. “So far, we are giving Sh2 Million per Ward and from next year, that is next financial year we are going to increase to Sh4 Million per ward which will be a total of Sh240 million in that financial year,” Governor Barasa stated The County chief further said that the Ward-based bursary fund will always be increased based on the increase in demand of the prospective beneficiaries. “We cannot ring-fence the fund and lock it at a specific amount in law because we have an opportunity of increasing because we have also enhanced our revenue sources,” Barasa said For the current disbursement, collectively, the County Government has released Sh120 Million as a bursary to the sixty wards and called for collaboration between the County and the National Government through the Constituency Development Fund to ensure parents are cushioned against the current harsh economic times. The County Government has also partnered with ACCESS KENYA to offer scholarships to needy learners who scored C+ and above in their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Examinations. However, Governor Barasa has implored Heads of learning institutions across the County not to send learners back home for non-payment of school fees saying parents should be allowed time to look for the required money owing to the economic tough times.
