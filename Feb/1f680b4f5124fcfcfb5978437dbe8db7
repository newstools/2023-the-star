Konde Gang CEO Harmonize alleges that he has never received a coin from his famous song 'Kwangwaru'. Through his Instagram page, Harmonize said despite being a top singer, someone else enjoys the benefits of his hard work. 'Kwangwaru' is still on top in the charts, with 100 million-plus views on YouTube. Harmonize was under Wasafi management when he released the collaboration with his former boss, Diamond Platnumz. "Even 'Kwangwaru', with more than 100 million views, someone is chopping that money so comfortably," he said. "Kama katanga yeye usikute ndio maana walikuwa wanapambana sanaa nipotee, walijua nikifika hii level ya sasa, watatapika." Harmonize said he might consider quitting music. "I know you can't believe this, but I have never collected 1USD from publishing all the music that I have been dropping for over seven years," he said. "Over 100 hit songs, remember. I own the master but I don't know who is collecting the money. I need them back because I have a kid. I'm here for her future and I need good life." The Bongo star added that he has been insulted and despised yet his money is still being consumed. Harmonize continued that he has been forced to spend a lot of money to get back his master, but he has still never received a cent from his songs. Harmonize and Diamond do not see eye to eye after Harmonize terminated his contract with Wasafi.
