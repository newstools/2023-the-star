Azimio spokesperson Makau Mutua has mockingly asked the government to create the office of the spouses of all CSs. Mutua said that the government should accord similar treatment accorded to Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi to other CSs. "Don’t stop at Number three, I request that the UDA regime gives every Cabinet Secretary an office of the fourth to the hundredth Lady/Gentleman. The taxpayers are happy to fund the fat offices in the name of Bottom-up!" He said. The remarks came after the government created the office of the spouse of Mudavadi, Tessie Musalia Mudavadi. In a statement, Musalia's communication director said the office will complement the work done by the first and second ladies of the country.
