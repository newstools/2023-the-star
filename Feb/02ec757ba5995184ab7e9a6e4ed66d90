Mike Sonko's daughter Sandra Mbuvi says she will never publicise her relationship online. She said the philosophy is from one of Cardi B's songs. "If you ain't put a ring on my finger, you ain't gonna get on my Instagram," Sandra said. "Even if you are dating me today, I cannot burden my boyfriend because that is my personal relationship. Everyone should deal with their own business and for me that is my personal business." She revealed plans to own a private plane. "It has been a very big dream of mine and one day by fate I will own it," Sandra said. "I have a lot of cars but I can't tell you because you will say I'm bragging. Personally, I have my own cars and when I start mentioning them, people think I'm bragging." Sandra also mentioned that she will soon move out of her parents' house.
