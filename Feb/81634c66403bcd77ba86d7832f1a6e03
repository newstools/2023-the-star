The Kenya Hockey Union 2023 league season begins on March 18, KHU secretary general Wycliffe Ongori has said. The KHU supremo said the union will hold a meeting with club officials this Saturday at the City Park Stadium to chart the way forward. Ongori said they hope to expedite a tight season with the leagues expected to end in time for the African Cup for Club Championship in December. "The plan is to have the season serve off on March 18 and have it complete by the time our teams travel to Malawi for the ACCC tournament," Ongori said. The 2022/23 season ended on January 29, two weeks before the ACC tournament in Nairobi. Strathmore Scorpions and Butali Warriors were crowned champions in the women's and men's category respectively. Kenyatta University Titans gained promotion back to the women's top tier after just one season in the Super League. Ongori also confirmed that the transfer window was closed on Sunday to allow teams step up their preparations for the new season. Ongori, who is also an umpire, added that national teams will have enough time to put their act together before major assignments. "We have the Under-21  African qualifiers for the World Cup and I believe the players will put their best foot forward with timely preparations," Ongori said. "There are the African Games as well. Though they have been pushed from August 2023 to 2024 with no time frame, the earlier we plan the better." "Our clubs to the ACCC competition will need quality time to prepare before heading to Malawi, who are already planning to host a successful event. When we hosted the tournament mid this month in Nairobi, Malawi  sent their team for benchmarking."
