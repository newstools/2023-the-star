Kakamega Governor Fernandez Barasa has urged the national treasury to release funds owed to counties to allow for proper planning and development. The governor who serves as the chairperson of the Finance and Economic Affairs Committee at the Council of Governors (CoG) asked the government to release funds for devolved functions such as ECDEs, fisheries and library services among others. Barasa was speaking when he inspected drugs and non-pharmaceuticals, valued at Sh13 million, delivered at the Kakamega County General Hospital on Wednesday. Barasa regretted that devolved units have not received funds from the Treasury since November 2022. The governor revealed that Treasury owes some counties monies dating back to the month of October 2022. This, he asserted, is against the Constitution and the spirit of devolution which champions more resources at the grassroots. “We have counties that are owed monies from last year which hasn’t yet been released despite this being a new year. Yet these counties are supposed to budget and function. This is totally contrary to the spirit of devolution,"  Barasa said. The Kakamega county boss also called on the Treasury to allocate Sh425 billion to counties in the subsequent budget instead of the proposed Sh380 billion. Barasa reiterated that delivery of health services and infrastructure are his biggest priority and assured residents that the county government will be spending Sh150 Million after every three months to re-stock health facilities across the county with essential drugs and non-pharms. The governor also assured nurses who missed out on their salaries for the months of December 2020 and January 2021 that they will be compensated. “My administration has a clear-cut compensation for health workers. The objective is to ensure county workers are well motivated to enable me to deliver my mandate to the people of Kakamega county." he said.
