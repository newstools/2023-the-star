Omgusii Nairobi County Forum has expressed its disappointment with President William Ruto's government. Led by their chairperson Josepth Nyandika, they have claimed that they are a marked community and injustices appear to have levelled against them. Addressing the media on Friday, he said that despite the community having voted for the Kenya Kwanza government overwhelmingly by having five elected MPs, they have been treated unfairly. “It is important to note that of the five regimes, this one in power is that one which has shown openly that is possible this community may cease to exist,” Nyandika noted. Top of their disappointment is that President Ruto only appointed one CS from the Kisii region in his cabinet, noting that other communities have more than two ministries. Also, they lamented that no PS from the Kisii community was appointed. Nyandika added that the Kisii community has been left out when the government is initiating development projects. “When communities are being given goodies in terms of development, even for those who didn’t vote for the UDA government, the gusii community is not even mentioned,” he said. The Omgusii Nairobi Community also claimed that there is an act of guaranteed revenge towards them. They explained that the intentions were clear when former Interior CS Fred Matiangi’s house was allegedly raided on Wednesday. “We can now see our own son Fred Matiang'i being harassed raising fears of abduction, disappearance and death,” they added. The community has called upon the Kenya Kwanza government to uphold the goodwill it had displayed after winning the elections.
