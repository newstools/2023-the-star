Azimio leader Raila Odinga has assured that the Opposition will abide by the law while holding ant-government protests. While reading the resolutions of Kitale’s Peoples Baraza on Sunday, Raila said only a legitimate government elected by the people can put the public at the centre of its agenda and fight for the welfare of the citizenry. He said Azimio will continue to push for the rejection of a government that “came to power by manipulating people’s will at the ballot.” “We shall use, as we are currently doing, legal, constitutional and peaceful means in line with Article 37 of our Constitution,” he said. Raila added that President William Ruto should stop the creation of more offices like those of Chief Administrative Secretary and expansion of the Executive. “Creation of these posts is a confirmation of the insensitivity of the Kenya Kwanza to the suffering and priorities of Kenya” “It is not the time to create positions for Kenya Kwanza rejects and crooks. Instead, Kenya Kwanza should direct resources towards making life livable for the people.” Raila said the Opposition will not relent in demanding for immediate reduction of the prices of basic commodities. “We will not do anything against the Constitution,” the Azimio leader assured. On February 22, Raila announced that he will lead mass action in 14 days if their demands including lowering cost of living are not met by Ruto. He said withdrawal of subsidies to food and education in the middle of drought and famine was reckless. Ruto has laughed off the threats saying he will not be intimidated with threats of mass action and protests.
