Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda has refuted reports that he has ditched Raila Odinga’s party after some nine ODM MPs met President William Ruto at State House, Nairobi on Tuesday. The lawmaker has instead said the meeting was a follow-up to President Ruto’s development tour in the Nyanza region last month. "It was basically a follow up to President William Ruto’s development tour in Nyanza early last month because there were indications that he may change his mind following anti-government rallies led by Raila Odinga," MP Ochanda told the Star. Despite being termed as selfish by ODM’s Director of Communication Philip Etale, the MP insisted that the MPs remain firmly in the Orange party despite meeting the Head of State. He explained that they met Ruto to get assurance on his commitment complete the development projects he promised the people of Nyanza. "We have not decamped from ODM and we made it clear that we are still ODM members," the legislator said during an interview. The ODM MPs who met the President and his Deputy Rigathi Gachagua include; Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Caroli Omondi (Suba South), Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Shakeel Shabir (Kisumu East) and Kisumu Senator Tom Ojienda
