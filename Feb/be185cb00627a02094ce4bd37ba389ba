US First Lady Jill Biden has said coming to Kenya in the past changed her life. She arrived in the country on Friday in what is her third visit, and first as the US First Lady. Speaking after her arrival, Jill said talking about Kenya to her granddaughter Naomi Biden is what made her want to tag along. "I have many incredible memories here. In fact, I told my granddaughter Naomi that coming here changed my life and that's why she wanted to join me," she said. The Professor of English said she was glad to be back, adding that she could not have asked for a warmer welcome. Jill was received at the JKIA by First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto and EAC CS Rebecca Miano. After alighting the Executive One Foxtrot the Military plane, the First Lady was met by two young girls who handed her a bouquet. During her two-day visit, Jill will draw attention to the ongoing drought in the Horn of Africa. In 2011, she visited the Daadab refugee camp, where she made a plea to the West for their aid. "Mothers are bringing their children from Somalia, walking sometimes 15,20,25 days and they lose their children along the way, the children die," she said then. "So what I'm asking is for Americans just to be, maybe reach out and help because the situation here is dire." The drought is the worst the region has experienced, with more than one million people facing food insecurity in Kenya. The Ministry of EAC said over 970,000 children below five years and 142,000 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers require urgent lifesaving treatment for malnutrition. In addition to talks on the dire food insecurities, Jill will also focus on women's empowerment and children's issues. "From soft lullabies to battle cries of justice, women nurse and nurture, teach and build, lead and dream our way forward each and every day," she said on Friday.
