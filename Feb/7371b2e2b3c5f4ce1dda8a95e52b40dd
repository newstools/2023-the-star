African Union Commission on Ethiopia peace process has said there is gradual restoration of essential services in the country. Through a statement, the commission said the Ethiopia National Defense forces have peacefully occupied Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray region. "Air transportation and telecommunication have been witnessed even as humanitarian aid interventions continue for the internally displaced people (IDPs)," the statement read. It was however noted that schools remain closed and the cost of living is still high in the region. The virtually convened meeting updated the panel on the occupancy of the Ethiopian Forces as part of the terms of the November 2 Pretoria peace agreement. According to the Former President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo, the Pretoria peace agreement called for a systematic and coordinated disarmament of the Tigray forces and restoration of the federal authority in the region. They also commended the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) and the Tigray Peopleâ€™s Liberation Front (TPLF) for their commitment to the AU-led peace process toward restoring long-lasting peace in the region that has been in fighting for the last two years. The meeting is part of efforts to stop the fighting which erupted in November 2020 after months of tension, and which has destroyed so many lives and livelihoods. There are around 5.2 million in need of humanitarian assistance in Tigray, including 3.8 million who need healthcare, according to the World Health Organisation. Thousands have been killed, with allegations of serious human rights violations committed by both sides. Retired President Uhuru Kenyatta joined the panel virtually.
