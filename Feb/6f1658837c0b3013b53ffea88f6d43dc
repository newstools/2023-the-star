Tottenham goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris has been ruled out for between six and eight weeks with a knee injury. The former France skipper, 36, sustained ligament damage in Spurs' 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday. Spurs have former Southampton and England international Fraser Forster as a backup. Academy players Brandon Austin and Alfie Whiteman are other options, but neither have much senior experience. Spurs are currently fifth in the Premier League and fighting for a Champions League spot for next season. They play Leicester City in the league on Saturday before traveling to AC Milan for their first-leg round-of-16 tie in the Champions League on Tuesday. Forster, who joined on a free transfer last summer, has made just one Premier League appearance for Spurs - a 2-2 Boxing Day draw with Brentford. Lloris, who captained France to a World Cup victory in 2018, announced his retirement from international football last month.Â He has kept seven clean sheets from 21 league games this season. Elsewhere, former Schalke, Spartak Moscow and RB Leipzig boss Domenico Tedesco has been appointed Belgium's head coach. The 37-year-old, who was born in Italy but also holds German citizenship, has signed a contract until after the 2024 European Championship. He replaces Roberto Martinez, who stood down after six years in charge following Belgium's group-stage exit at the World Cup in Qatar. "It is a great honour to be the new head coach of Belgium," said Tedesco. "I'm really looking forward to the task and I'm extremely motivated. I had a very good feeling right from the first conversation." Tedesco's first match in charge is a Euro 2024 qualifier against Sweden in Stockholm on March 24.
