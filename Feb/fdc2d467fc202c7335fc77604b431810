Love is in the air and the bug has settled on Bomet Woman Representative Linet ‘Toto’ Chepkorir. Photos of her fiancé Godfrey Kimutai Tanui proposing to her went viral on Twitter as the world marked Valentine's Day. In the photos taken in a love-themed room, Tanui is seen on a bended knee as Linet looked on, perhaps mesmerised by the gesture. The proposal drew mixed reactions from Kenyans online including Mumias East MP Peter Salasya. Taita Taveta Woman Rep Lydia Haika wished the couple luck. "Congratulations Linet Toto. Indeed love is a beautiful thing with the right person. Wishing you the best." "Hii imekuja nyumbani! Congratulations Geoffrey Tanui (Nifty Kim) and my Women Rep Bomet County Hon. Linet Toto. Welcome to Konoin Constituency a beautiful land with great people. Lapaa Taa," Konoin MP Brighton Yegon said. "Hon Linet ToTo Bomet Woman Rep Officially Off the Market , Congratulations Mhesh," korir_cornel tweeted. "While some of us were attending serious sessions at #MensConference2023, Linet Toto says YES to her man from Bomet," Captain Kipkorir said. "Linet Toto and Nifty Kim in 2022… Toto uko sure??" Insecurity KE tweeted.
