A man has admitted sending a fake bomb to an address in Cornwall. Lee Moody, 59, from St Dogmaels, Pembrokeshire, pleaded guilty to sending a letter to cause distress or anxiety, and causing a bomb hoax. Residents in the village of Flushing had to be evacuated after the fake bomb was posted to a home there in January. Appearing via video-link at Swansea Crown Court, Moody was told to expect a jail term when he is sentenced next month. Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court heard last month that authorities did not know it was a hoax until they tried to detonate the device. It also heard how the parcel in which the fake bomb was held contained a message warning the recipient to "make your peace with God. I am coming for you". Moody will be sentenced on 24 March.
