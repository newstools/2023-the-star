KCB has donated Sh1 million sponsorship towards the final leg of the 2022/23 Safari Tour starting on Saturday at Muthaiga Golf Club. While handing over the cheque, KCB Group marketing and communications director, Rosalind Gichuru said: “Today’s announcement reaffirms our commitment to supporting the development of sports in this country. "As you may all be aware, KCB Bank is not a stranger to supporting Kenyan sports. Our footprint in supporting different sports disciplines from athletics, football to golf and rugby dates many years back.” She added: “This final leg of the 2022/23 Safari Tour Golf series provides us with a great opportunity to support our local and regional professionals as they prepare to take on the 2023 Magical Kenya Open later in March.” The Muthaiga leg, which ends on Wednesday next week, will culminate with the naming of the professionals who have qualified to play at the 2023 Magical Kenya Open, slated for March 9-12 at the Muthaiga Golf Club. This is the second year the brand will be supporting the region’s professional golfers through the Safari Tour and comes right after the bank’s sponsorship of the 2023 Magical Kenya Ladies Open, which was held at Vipingo last weekend. On his part, Kenya Open Golf Limited’s director and Kenya Golf Union Chairman Njani Ndiritu said: “On behalf of the Kenya Open Golf Limited, we are grateful to KCB for supporting this last leg of the Safari Tour. This is a welcome boost to the series, especially going into the Kenya Open.” The final leg will be preceded by a Pro-Am event, where amateurs will play alongside local and regional pros, before the professionals take centre stage between March 12 and 15 for valuable Road to Kenya open points.
