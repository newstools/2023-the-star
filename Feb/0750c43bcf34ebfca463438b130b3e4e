Narok Senator Ledama Olekina now says that the Kenya Kwanza regime is not only tribal but also discriminatory. Speaking on Tuesday, the senator claimed Ruto has been appointing many of his tribespeople to government positions, while his deputy Gachagua is always showing hatred whenever he speaks. He said what they are doing will lead to more apathy and lawlessnessÂ in the country. He said this is the reason, Kenyans should rally against the current regime. "This government is not only tribal but also discriminatory! Ruto appoints only his tribe mates, and Rigathi spews venom whenever he speaks. This will lead to more apathy among Kenyans, rampant corruption as well as total lawlessness in the country. More reasons to rally against it," Ledama said. His remarks come a few days after Gachagua during an address in Kericho said they will prioritise those who backed their presidential bid when it comes to sharing opportunities in government. Gachagua who was speaking in Kericho said it was laughable that some members of the opposition had started trooping to State House seeking government positions. The DP said his role at State House is to ensure regions that backed them get development before those that did not. "This government is a shares company. It has the owners who have majority shares, those with minority shares and those that don't have any shares," Gachagua said. "You invested in this company owned by William Ruto and Rigathi Gachagua you must harvest. You invested and your time to harvest is now... Even they (the opposition) will harvest, but they have to wait for you to finish harvesting."
