Education CS Ezekiel Machogu has said Junior Secondary Schools (JSS)Â  will adopt the name of the Primary Schools in which they are domiciled in. Schools will now do away with the prefix -'Primary School' and add 'School' after their preferred name. "For instance, Mwendapole Primary School will now be identified as Mwendapole School (Primary and JSS)," he said. In the released guidelines, Machogu said school managers and officials will facilitate a seamless transition from Primary School (Grade 6) to JSS (Grade 7). "Except in special circumstances, the comprehensive school shall adopt the name of the Primary School in which they are domiciled," the statement read. For the purpose of school fees payment, Machogu said Primary Schools and Junior Secondary Schools shall have separate Bank accounts. The CS also said, after Junior Secondary Education, a learner is expected to communicate effectively, verbally and non-verbally, in diverse contexts, and demonstrate social skills, and spiritual and moral values for peaceful co-existence. "We expect them to explore, manipulate, manage and conserve the environment effectively for learning and sustainable development, practise relevant hygiene, sanitation and nutrition skills to promote health," he said.
