ODM and Azimio leader Raila Odinga is threatening mass action within  14 days if government does not bring down the price of basic commodities and revisit the election result. He wants taxes reduced and subsidies restored. This demand is ridiculous and unaffordable. If Raila had become president, he would also have had to raise taxes and slash subsidies. From 2013 to 2022, the national debt multiplied six times from $12 billion to $72 billion. The government is now trying to work out how to repay the $2 billion Eurobond which matures in 2024. If government defaults on the national debt, the economic consequences will hurt ordinary Kenyans far more than the removal of subsidies on fuel and unga. Raila is also demanding that the IEBC server be opened to scrutiny by independent auditors (hopefully not the 'ethical' Israeli hackers). But the Supreme Court rejected his petition, largely because he failed to produce a single Form 34A that differed from the ones posted on the IEBC website. He is now relying on a vague and discredited 'whistleblower's' report of unknown origin. Raila should drop his threat of mass action. It is not justified.
