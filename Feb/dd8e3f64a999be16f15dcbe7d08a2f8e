Azimio Chief Raila Odinga is set to visit Busia county on Sunday to conduct his anti-government rallies. On Friday, Azimio La Umoja Coalition took the rally to Machakos. This was the fourth of a series of rallies the coalition has lined up to pile pressure on President William Ruto's government against what they term as unpopular policies. Raila led more than 100 leaders elected on various political parties affiliated to the outfit in the protests dubbed 'public consultation meetings' at Mlolongo in Mavoko subcounty. On Saturday Raila was in Kisumu county after attending late Education CS George Magoha's burial in Siaya. This time he was accompanied by retired President Uhuru Kenyatta who affirmed his support to Raila. The ODMÂ  leader has been persistent in his anti-government rallies despite criticism from some leaders to stop on grounds that he is dividing the country. "We must continue to have these barazas to sensitise our people of their democratic right which has been stolen. These people know that they stole elections and they want to rule you as if they won elections," Raila said during an Azimio coalition retreat on Thursday. After the Busia rally, Raila is set to hold another rally in Kisii town on Monday.
