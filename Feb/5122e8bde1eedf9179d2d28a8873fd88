A woman who allegedly used fraudulent tricks to defraud a businessman has been charged. The woman allegedly asked the businessman to pay Sh950,000 for a lamb meat export business to Dubai that did not exist. The court heard that Maureen Anyango Owade is said to have committed the offense between December 5 and 6, 2022 at an unknown place. According to the complainant, the accused had promised to partner with him in the said business. The two were said to be business friends before the offense was committed. But after the complainant suspected foul play, heÂ reported the matter to the police and the accused person was arrested. Owade denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua. She urged the court to release her on reasonable bond terms. The magistrate released him on a Sh1 million bond with the surety of the same amount. The magistrate also directed that the accused person be supplied with all the witness statements and documentary evidence that the prosecution will rely on during the entire case. The case will be mentioned on February 27.
