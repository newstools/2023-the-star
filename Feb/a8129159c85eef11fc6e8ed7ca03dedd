Britain's Heather Watson reached the second round of the ATX Open with a 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 win over Danka Kovinic. Watson let slip a 4-2 lead in the opening set and failed to take two set points on the Montenegrin's serve before winning a tie-break. She kept Kovinic at arm's length in the second set and converted her second match point on serve in Austin, Texas. Watson will play Sloane Stephens or Taylor Townsend, who meet later on Tuesday, in the last 16. Britain's Katie Boulter lost 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) to American Peyton Sterns in the first round.
