Oburu Odinga has alleged that President William Ruto is planning to stay in power indefinitely. This would be very bad if it were true, but is it true? Oburu's only evidence is that Ruto has been meeting opposition MPs and political leaders. Ruto says this because he wants to heal divisions in society and work together with the opposition to solve Kenya's problems. But Oburu says Ruto wants to neutralise the opposition so that he can stay in power indefinitely. He is trying to buy out the opposition MPs so he can change the Constitution, according to Oburu. The only problem is that Ruto has never said he wants to stay in power and to be the next President Museveni. Kenya allows presidents to be in power for a maximum of two terms of five years. This constitutional provision must remain in force but let us not put words in Ruto's mouth, he never said he wants to lift term limits. But if he, or someone else, does try to remove term limits, then every Kenyan should campaign to keep them. But until that day comes, let's not claim that Ruto is planning to eliminate term limits.
