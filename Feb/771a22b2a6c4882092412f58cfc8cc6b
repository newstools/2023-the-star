Sauti Sol's Bien-Aime Baraza and his wife Chiki Kuruka attended Chris Brown’s concert in London. The Inauma hitmaker used his socials to share moments captured from the sold-out show – saluting Brown for a well-done performance. The star described the concert as one of the best shows he has ever attended in his life as a fan. The star was in the crowd together with his wife Chiki Kuruka who also doubles as his manager. "That was the best show I have watched in my life," Bien said. Bien captured Brown's fashion, dance moves and vocal cords. Bien could be heard in the background singing at the top of his voice. Under the influence is Brown's' first tour in the UK in 14 years. The O2 Arena in London was fully sold out. The show was the first of six sold-out concerts at the venue. All his other shows are sold out except for the extra shows. Brown started his first show in Dublin on February 11 and 12 before moving to London from February 14 to 17.
