The Cabinet has ratified a plan to implement the Kenya Digital Superhighway Project captured under the Kenya Kwanza manifesto paving way for the creation of 25,000 public Wi-Fi hotspots across the country. The project being undertaken by the Ministry of ICT will see over 100,000 kilometres of fibre optic cable laid in all parts of the country. In the plan, digital village Smart Hubs and Studios are also going to be established in each of the 1,450 wards to strengthen the delivery of e-government services and e-commerce while enhancing opportunities for Kenyans to participate in economic development. “The revolutionary project seeks to strengthen our nation’s ICT backbone by increasing the fibre network coverage across the country hence reducing the cost of internet connectivity,” read a dispatch from the Cabinet. The government seeks to realize the project by 2027. The government has announced that over 1,200 services have already been onboarded on the e-Citizen platform with another 5,000 set to be realized in the next six months. President William Ruto said the automation of services was part of the “new paradigm” in the delivery of public services. It is being implemented under the thematic approaches aimed at digitizing manual records, enhancing data sharing across agencies, using of single Unique Identifier for access to digital services and business process automation. The innovations are being rolled out under the Kenya Digital Economy Acceleration Programme and supported under the World Bank’s Digital Economy Moonshot Project. “The hotspots are targeting local businesses and underserved communities, but the number would increase significantly by the end of the year,” ICT CS Eliud Owalo said. In Nairobi, 17 hotspots have been set up in City Market and Muthurwa, while others in Nyeri, Bondo and Ahero. Owalo said through the digital infrastructure initiative, atleast 1.5 to 2 million jobs can be created.
