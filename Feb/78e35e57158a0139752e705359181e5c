You might have come across a packet with beads substance every time you buy something new and you wonder whether to throw it away or keep it. They are called Silica gel, a porous form of silicon dioxide that has the power to absorb moisture by attracting water molecules. It is made from sodium silicate which is highly absorptive. These bead-like substances are packed in paper packs and put into items that need to be kept dry and moisture-free. They are mostly found in consumer products in shoe boxes, purses and new electronics. Silica gel serves to eliminate humidity by removing moisture from the air creating a dry and moisture-free environment for custom product packagings like electronics, cosmetics and medication that are at higher risk of damage. The gel helps to keep leather products dry and helps get rid of bad odour that is left in products after manufacturing. The gel also helps to increase the life of the product like medicines, vitamins, cereals, and anything that can get spoiled by being soggy, it is packed with silica gel to catch water particles which keeps them fresh. Other uses of silica gel include putting it in jewellery cases to keep them shiny and bright and placing them in old documents or photo albums to keep them from moisture. The next time you come across a silica gel, keep in mind its benefits and store them because they might just come in handy.
