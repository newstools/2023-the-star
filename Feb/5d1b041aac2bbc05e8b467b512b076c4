Nakuru City Queens team manager Benard Esitoko is satisfied with the performance of his players despite losing 2-0 to Vihiga Queens in the Kenya Women's Premier League match at Mumias Sports Complex. Goals from Janet Moraa and Shalyn Opisa secured maximum points for Vihiga who are the defending champions. "The performance was encouraging. We showed character and a fighting spirit only that we did not utilise our chances," Esitoko said. "We host Bunyore next weekend at our backyard. A win will ensure we finish the first leg with 20 points. That's our bare minimum. The defense has really improved. The attack needs to be clinical." Esitok said Nakuru's away form needs to improve as well. Nakuru lost to Wadadia, Thika and Vihiga on their travels and won just twice. "Our home form is good since we haven't lost a match. Rectifying our mistakes will help elevate the away performance," Esitoko added. Thika Queens slayed Kayole Starlets 5-0 with goals from Grace Wekesa, Wendy Achieng and  Sarah Idzah. Kangemi Ladies suffered a humiliating 7-0 defeat in the hands of rampant Ulinzi Starlets at Dagoretti high school. Cindy Ngairah, Sheryl Angachi, Lucy Nato, Mercy Airo and Christine Wekesa were all on the scoresheet. Commenting on the victory, Ulinzi coach Joseph Wambua said: “The game was good  as we won.  We hope to continue winning because the priority is to fight for the league title."
