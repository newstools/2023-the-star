The Competition Authority of Kenya has appointed Dr Adano Wario as the acting director-general after the expiry of Wang’ombe Kariuki’s tenure. Kariuki whose term ended this month has served two terms of five years each, having been appointed in January 2013 as the first CAK director general. Prior to the announcement, Wario has been serving as the CAK’s planning, policy, and research director. CAK chairman Nelson Ndirangu in a statement noted the appointment will ensure business continuity and uninterrupted service delivery. In his acceptance speech, Wario said he will prioritise deepening competition in sectors such as the digital economy, agriculture, financial services and promoting the competitiveness of SMEs. “Going forward, I shall prioritize deepening competition in these sectors," he said. Wario has 15 years of experience in applied research, policy-making, and the development of legislative frameworks. The authority is responsible for the prevention of anti-competitive practices in the economy, the removal of constraints on the free play of competition in the market, and the protection of consumer rights by means of investigation, prohibition and control of unfair business practices. Ndirangu said the outgoing chief (Kariuki) has contributed to improving Kenya’s investment climate by developing regulations and guidelines, that created transparency and predictability in the competition enforcement process. “We owe immense gratitude to Mr Kariuki, who departs after overseeing the CAK’s transformation from a department within the Ministry of Finance to a semi-autonomous institution that is held in high regard by stakeholders, nationally, regionally and internationally,” he said.
