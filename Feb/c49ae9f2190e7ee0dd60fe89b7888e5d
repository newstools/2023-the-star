Education CS Ezekiel Machogu has revealed that last week the government disbursed Sh16 billion to secondary schools. Machogu revealed this while overseeing Form 1 admission at St George’s Girls on Monday. He warned school heads against charging parents levies that have not been approved by the ministry. “Last week we disbursed Sh16 billion which went to public secondary schools,” Machogu said. Every school will receive Sh22,444 per student admitted. All primary schools will receive Sh15,042 for every Grade 7 student. For primary schools, he said the capitation will also be received for the learners. However, for junior secondary, he said the ministry is yet to get data on how many students were enrolled. “Once we get the necessary information of those able to register in junior secondary we will send the money anytime from now,” he said. He said the ministry is waiting for the exact number of students admitted to Grade 7 before the end of this week. The CS said after getting the data the ministry will know the amount required to be disbursed to schools.
