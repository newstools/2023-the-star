UK High Commissioner to Kenya Jane Marriott has called on investigative bodies in the country to take action following the sex for work expose by the BBC. Taking to her official Twitter page, Marriott said she is concerned by the allegations of appalling behaviour made in the BBC documentary. "I welcome the commitment by the companies to investigate, cooperate with the Kenyan authorities, and take action to protect staff in Kenya," she said. Marriott affirmed that sexual abuse and exploitation have no place in society. In the expose released on February 20, sexual exploitation was uncovered on tea farms that supply some of the UK's most popular brands. More than 70 women on Kenyan tea farms, owned for years by two British companies, told the BBC they had been sexually abused by their supervisors. Secret filming showed local bosses, on plantations, pressuring an undercover reporter for sex. Three managers have now been suspended. One of the companies faced similar allegations more than 10 years ago and launched a "zero tolerance" approach to sexual harassment as well as a reporting system and other measures. Several employees told the BBC that because work is so scarce, they are left with no choice but to give in to the sexual demands of their bosses or face having no income. "I can't lose my job because I have kids," one woman said. Another woman said a divisional manager stopped her job until she agreed to have sex with him. "It is just torture, he wants to sleep with you, and then you get a job," she said.
