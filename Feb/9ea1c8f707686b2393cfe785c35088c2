Diamond Platnumz and Zuchu were spotted together at a private party hosted by Mama Dangote on Sunday. This comes a few weeks after they announced they had broken up. Zuchu was invited by Diamond's mother and received well by his family. In videos shared by Wasafi TV, Zuchu is seen hugging Diamond's mother and sister Esma as she warmly welcomed her to the bash. We do not get to see if Diamond and Zuchu talk. Also at the party is Ricardo Momo, Diamond's half brother. The singer and Ricardo share a father, Salumu Nyange, but different mothers. In another video, Zuchu is showered with money by sports personality Haj Manara. Diamond was recently in London and Dubai, where he bought Zuchu a chain withÂ her face.
