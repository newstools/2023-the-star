National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung'wah has said the Kenya Revenue Authority should check if the alleged hundreds of billions offshore in the Pandora Papers paid taxes. Taking to his Twitter, Ichungw'ah said the income that was allegedly made must be taxed. "KRA is obligated to check if the hundreds of billions offshore in the Pandora Papers had taxes paid here before being shipped offshore. Any income made here legitimately must be taxed," he tweeted. On Monday, Ichung'wah also stated that he had written to Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndugu to release information about individuals and firms who have benefited from tax waivers. "We have a record of tax waivers that have been sent, this is between 2012 and 2017, we now want records from both the handshake regime and President William Ruto's regime," he said. The Kikuyu MP said his move does not target anyone, adding the push was not meant to settle political fights "Even if anyone was granted tax waiver under the Kenya Kwanza government, we expect that information to be available," he said. His statement comes amid President William Ruto's push that every Kenyan should pay taxes. “I'm happy that as a country, we have built a consensus that irrespective of your status, region or religion there will be no tax waiver for anybody,” Ruto said. The government's push to have all Kenyans pay taxes has been seen as an attack on retired President Uhuru Kenyatta and former President Daniel Moi's families. On January 30, while speaking in Mombasa, Ruto stated that some people exempted themselves from paying taxes when they were in power. “The good people who were used to exempting themselves from paying tax, their days are up," Ruto said. "It doesn’t matter even if they sponsor demonstrations so that they don’t pay tax. I promise them they will pay tax. There is no more exemption."
