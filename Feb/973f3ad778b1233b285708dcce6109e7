DAYSTAR University are yet to win any of their Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league games but coach Martin Kamau is happy with the progress made so far. The varsity girls remain rooted at the bottom of the 12-team table without a win and Kamau revealed the way they are responding in training is a sign of better things to come. “We joined the league late and the team is not even one year old since joining. However,  we are coming up well and I believe we will get there,” offered Kamau. Daystar University lost all their four-weekend games at Nyayo Stadium, going down 55-12 to Ulinzi Sharks, 40-12 to Net Navigators, 31-28 to Nairobi City Council (NCC) and 40-20 to Amazon. The team, he noted, has steadily shown considerable improvements in their league matches and equally done well in the Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) games. “From where we started, the performance so far in the KUSA games is good. We are shining there and also gaining a lot going by the results we have posted,” he said He heaped praise on Meldone Akoth, the team's top goal-getter who leads by example in every game. He said her exploits and leadership qualities on the court are a huge motivating factor for the rest. “She is good. She has skill and speed and we are banking on her to provide leadership. So far, she has done extremely well and I am happy with her out-put for the team,” said Kamau. Daystar University, who have played 13 games have a chance of a first win when they take on the eleventh-placed Rising Star this weekend. Their other game is against rivals Kenyatta University. Unbeaten Nairobi Water Queens have continued their surge to another title as they sit at the summit with a maximum of 28 points from 14 games and Ulinzi Sharks moved to second with 24 from 13 ties.
