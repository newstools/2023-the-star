Media industry stakeholders from across Africa are set to converge in Nairobi to chat a way forward on revenue sustainability for the industry. The event, the Africa Media Festival, the first of its kind, will provide an opportunity for stakeholders in the sector to share new trends, technologies and networks that can help the industry in the sustainability journey. The media industry is among the sectors worst hit with the changing business models that has led to a reduction in revenues. The event to be held in Nairobi is scheduled for February 14 and 15 "We invite media players from across different media spaces, journalists, podcasters, authors, and illustrators to join us and address cultural, social, political and economic issues around contemporary issues affecting Africa," Executive Director Baraza Media Maurice Otieno said. A 2023 report by Reuters and Oxford university pointed to expected layoffs and other cost-cutting measures by media organisations in the new year. The conference will serves as a beacon for leading thinkers to experiment, problem-solve, learn, and incubate new models of telling stories while sustaining revenues at the same time. The conference targets investors, grant makers, media owners, social media platforms, journalists, creatives and governments. “We are targeting a total of 1,500 delegates over the two days. With the conference being a Pan- African conference, we aim to have government representatives and speakers from other countries within and outside the continent and outside” added Otieno. Some of the delegates expected are cartoonists, writers, journalists, NFT/ Blockchains experts, TV, radio, social media influencers, photographers, government officials, funders and poets.
