The Supreme Court has set aside a decision that stopped Bia Tosha from having control of 22 beer distribution routes in Nairobi. The Supreme Court judges restored the orders of the High Court that had allowed Bia Tosha to continue distributing products in Namanga, Bissil, Kajiado, Kitengela, Athi River, Industrial Area, South B, Nairobi West, Kenyatta, Lang'ata, Rongai, Kiserian, Magadi, Upper Hill, Ngong Road, Hurlingham, Kawangware, Satellite and Dagoretti. This order of the High Court was never obeyed prompting Bia Tosha to file contempt proceedings against Kenya Breweries Limited directors. Bia Tosha, one of the largest beer distributors, wanted the directors committed to civil jail. The contempt proceedings were never dealt with even when the matter escalated to the Court of Appeal. The apex court in remitting the case back to the High Court said the court should 'proceed to assess the suitable punishment arising out of the contempt'. The matter before court emanates from commercial agreements between Bia Tosha and KBL concerning the distribution of the latter's products. KBL sought to repossess the distribution territories of some routes that had been previously granted to Bia Tosha in 2000, and declined to refund goodwill it had paid on the ground that the amounts were non-refundable. KBL further appointed other distributors to that distribution territory. In reaction to KBLs measures, Bia Tosha chose to battle the matter in court.
