Kenya Sevens head coach Damian McGrath believes the side have to improve decision-making ahead of the Vancouver Sevens this weekend. Shujaa registered a disappointing performance in the just concluded Los Angeles Sevens, picking a solitary point despite a promising start. "I believe our decision-making, especially in our matches against Fiji and Japan, let us down. We now regroup and look at getting something positive in Vancouver," said McGrath. Shujaa had started the tournament with a huge upset win, beating Australia 12-7, but then lost to Olympic and World champions Fiji 19-5. Needing a victory against lowly-ranked Japan, Kenya lost to 7-5 to see their hopes of a first main cup quarterfinal of the season go up in smoke. Shujaa lost further ground in the classification with losses to Canada (12-5) and USA (26-21) to finish 13th in the two-day tournament. The Englishman said there is no room to dwell on the past weekend's performance, rather, they need to forge ahead with focus on Vancouver, where they face Fiji, Great Britain and Uruguay. “We have a good opportunity to bounce back. It's a fairly strong pool. We learnt our lessons in Los Angeles and we hope we can make the right decisions this weekend,” said McGrath. He observed that the weather conditions in Los Angeles did not suit his players, with the rains making it impossible for the players to execute their style of play. "The rain and wind were not ideal conditions. Some of the players have contracted cold but I believe they will be fine by the middle of the week. Skipper Nelson Oyoo said the mood in the team is still upbeat. "We have a couple of issues to work on but the potential in the group is massive. We beat Australia but we need to be consistent if we are to amass more points in the series,” said Oyoo. The Nakuru RFC winger believes they can make it to the top 10, thus avoiding relegation. "The team is gelling well and it's only a matter of time before we moved up the log," he added.
