Two siblings from Mavuni area of Nguutani ward, Mwingi West and who are total orphans are yet to join Form 1. Stella Munyambu and her brother, Kithii Munyambu, both sat for their KCPE last year and scored 289 and 262 marks, respectively. However, the two are still at home and have no hope of joining  secondary school. Stellah received a calling letter to Matuu H.G. Memorial Girls High School while her brother should report to Thatha High School but their brother who takes care of them is unable to educate them. "Our brother who does manual job in Garissa is not able to take us to Form 1," she said. Kithii said he wants to become an accountant in a bid to end the poverty line. The learners stay with their Form 3 brother who also faces lots of challenges in school. Boniface said at times he is forced to do casual jobs in order to raise school fees. "I am in Form 3 at Muthoni Secondary School and learning has not been easy. I call upon well wishers to help my siblings report to school," he said Julius Songolo, the village elder, said the children are in dire need of help as they live on their own after their parents passed on more than 10 years ago. He said the three most of the times sleep on empty stomachs. "We call on our leaders as well as well wishers to help these children achieve their dreams through education," he said.
