The government has initiated the process of centralising secondary school bursaries across the country. Early learning and Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang said the ministry will build the capacity to implement the process. "The government is at the advanced stage of ensuring the mandate becomes fulfilled by JKF," Kipsang said. This means students will soon have to apply for all bursaries through one organization The PS said the ministry will ensure JKF can sustain and play the role. In 2022, JKF was fronted as the most suitable foundation to take up the centralisation role. "As we prepare JKF to play the central role we envisage that you become our national body for managing scholarships," he said. This comes even as Usawa Agenda now called for the harmonization of all forms of bursaries to one national institution. This proposal was presented to the Presidential Working Party on Education Reforms in 2022. The lobby executive director Emmanuel Manyasa said this will reduce the 'games' that are played for beneficiaries. "Through one, apolitical national institution with decentralised structures that go down to the ward level," Manyasa said. He clarified that the ward-level structures will be responsible for the identification of needy students. "Working with the communities to ascertain their level of need and recommend the cases to the higher levels for bursaries," he said. He added that the team would then make public the funds that have been disbursed to the needy students. This data will be broken down to the county, constituency and ward levels. "It would also enhance efficiency and reach more beneficiaries in a meaningful way," he said. Kipsang spoke on Friday when he commissioned 3,000 Jomo Kenyatta Foundation ScholarshipsÂ worth Sh1.1 billion.
