Retired president Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday gave the clearest hint that he is still in the Azimio coalition. The former president referred to opposition leader Raila Odinga as his party leader, affirming his place in Azimio. "My brother, my friend, my party leader Raila Odinga fellow mourners, we are here to join you today to celebrate the life of a great son," Uhuru said in his introductory remarks. Raila is the Azimio La umoja One Kenya party leader while Uhuru is the chairperson of the outfit. The move could jolt a section of Jubilee politicians who have declared they want to have the party exit Azimio. The retired president's remarks signalled that his Jubilee party is still a member of the Azimio coalition despite the plan by elected MPs to have it pull out. On Friday, a section of Jubilee MPs held a meeting in Naivasha and announced the process to have the party exit Azimio. They also announced plans to convene a special national delegates convention to ratify a working arrangement with president William Ruto's government. The MPs also kicked out Jubilee secretary general Jeremiah Kioni, replacing him with Kanini Kega in acting capacity. They also suspended vice-chairperson David Murathe and replaced him with Eldas MP Adan Keynan. Following the developments, it was assumed that Uhuru's future in Azimio was uncertain. However, Kioni had on Friday evening insisted that Uhuru is firmly in Azimio.
