Kenya Prisons must remain level-headed as the Kenya Volleyball Federation women's league starts at Nyayo Stadium this weekend, coach Josp Barasa has said. The wardresses are set to play Vihiga (Saturday) and Nairobi Water (Sunday). Barasa said his charges need to put aside last month's poor showing, in which they surrendered the national title to rivals Kenya Pipeline at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani Indoor Arena. Prisons finished third in the four-team playoffs in a season marred by the absence of several key first team players. "In everything that we will be doing in the new season, focus must be the focal point. We have to quickly forget the disappointment of last season and begin on a clean slate," said Barasa. "A good start will reinstate our confidence as we target maximum points in the two matches. We are all aware of what happened last season and there's no room for complacency this time round." Barasa faces a Herculean task to restore back the lost glory considering Prisons' fiercest rivals KCB and Kenya Pipeline are also back in shape. Prisons, who skipped the Mombasa leg of the previous season, lost to both KCB and Pipeline â€” both in regular season and in the playoffs. "Seasons tend to change. You cannot be on top of the game all the time. Don't forget that this is a women's team and sometimes you have to deal with complex matters," said Barasa. "All is not lost in the wake of the title heartbreak. We are Prisons, winning is in our DNA and we will rise again. I am happy some of the players are back in training and look better." Barasa refused to delve into the threat their weekend rivals pose but observed that Vihiga and Nairobi Water are not pushovers. He said little-known team are usually problematic to compete against and must be handled cautiously. "Honestly it's hard to comprehend the so-called small teams because you do not know how they will turn up and the formation they'll use," said Barasa.
