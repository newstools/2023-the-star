Embattled Judge Said Chitembwe has filed an affidavit at the Supreme Court seeking to overturn his ouster bid. He filed his appeal before the Supreme Court to challenge the decision by Justice Mumbi Ngugi- led tribunal, which recommended his removal through a report presented to President William Ruto. In the affidavit, Chitembwe has alleged former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko staged-managed the videos and audio recordings that were used against him. “The tribunal erred by relying on video and audio cell phone recordings by Sonko and one Francis Wambua to make the recommendations that I should be sacked when it was clear Sonko had coached the witnesses on what to say prior to the recordings,” he said in his appeal He also claimed that the allegations used against him were not proved to the required standard. Chitembwe also said Judicial Service Commission lacked the Locus Stanch to initiate removal proceedings against him. "The petition by the JSC was effectively relying on other Petitions by third parties," he said. Through his lawyer, Chitembwe wants the court to rule that the tribunal was misled by evidences presented by Sonko. "The tribunal erred in law by failing to hold that the video and audio recordings were inadmissible for having been obtained in a deliberate scheme of entrapping me," he said. Sonko's aide-Francis Wambua Kivuva- had confessed to having recorded the conversation between his boss and Chitembwe in regards to a parcel of land in Kwale. Kivuva used a spyglass and a DV Auto IR wristwatch to capture the information. The recordings went viral last in 2021 after Sonko posted on his Facebook page and Twitter accounts a series of recorded telephone conversations and video records dubbed ‘the rot in the Kenyan judiciary’. The tribunal found the six allegations being lack of impartiality, lack of integrity, lack of accountability, and lack of professionalism among others were proved.
