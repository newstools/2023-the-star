A lady is nursing serious injuries at Meru Teaching and Referral hospital after being stabbed by a man she met on Facebook. According to a statement from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the woman met the man based in Meru through Facebook. "It all began with a ‘Hi’ in messenger before the two built a relationship without the lady realising the danger she was getting herself into," DCI said. The man then promised her a house party which was supposed to culminate in a happy ending. As a result, the man requested the woman to travel to Meru for the party and tag along with her friend for ‘his friend’. Dressed up for the party, the woman together with her friend set for the four-hour trip to Meru on Tuesday evening at 6 pm from Nairobi hoping for an exciting moment with the man. “On arrival in Meru, the man asked them to board another matatu headed to Maua, 58 kilometers further, and alight at a nondescript bus stop known as kwa Amos,” DCI said. “None of them had ever been there. They had only heard of Maua from friends.” The DCI said the two ladies became skeptical due to the darkness but continued with their journey nonetheless. They then alighted at the said stage and found the man waiting for them. “After vehemently apologising for the sudden change of the party venue, they were led to a dark path which the man said would lead to their final rendezvous,” DCI said. It was at that point that the two ladies screamed for help as they rushed towards the main road. "The man immediately reached for a knife and stabbed one woman on her shoulder before fleeing into darkness." She was rushed to Muthara hospital by a good samaritan who was walking home before being transferred to Meru Teaching and Referral hospital for specialised treatment. Police based in Maua have since launched a manhunt for the suspect.
