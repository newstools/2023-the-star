The Michael Olunga Football Academy (MOFA) has formed a collaboration with three schools to mentor and develop future football stars. The academy, which is situated in Othoro, Homa Bay County, and focuses on sports mentoring, is the idea of Harambee stars captain and Qatar-based striker Michael Olunga. As a first step toward further such collaborations, the academy entered into a partnership agreement with academic and sporting heavyweights Agoro Sare School in Homa Bay county, St Mary's School Yala in Siaya county, and Kisumu Day in Kisumu county. MOFA develops and trains talent ranging in age from under 10 to under 18. MOFA FC, a football team run by the Academy, competes in the Football Kenya Federation National Division One League. The schools will offer educational scholarships to students from the football academy to pursue their education as they continue to hone their football skills. According to Victor Olunga, the star striker's brother, the MOFA Academy has eight players at St. Marys Yala and four players at Kisumu Day high school and is already partnered with Agoro Sare School while seeking new schools to work with.
