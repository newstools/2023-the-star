Kenya Lionesses have embarked on rigorous pre-season training ahead of a busy international season. Kenya Lionesses will feature in the Africa Cup tournament in Madagascar in May, where they face champions South Africa, Cameroon and Madagascar while the Sevens team is set to play in the Olympic qualifiers in October in Tunisia. Team manager Camilyne Oyuayo said the training is meant to keep the players fit and fresh but the exercise will intensify from next month. “ We have had very robust pre-season training for the last six weeks just to ensure the girls are in shape and in good spirits because we want to get the foundation for the championship,” added Oyauayo. She added that a good number of the girls have been playing in the Kenya Cup women's category this season and this is good for the national team. “ The girls look energized and determined to make the country proud and we are hoping they will be in peak shape later this month or early  April, " she added The Lionesses qualified for the Africa Cup in November last year by beating Uganda 22-3 and Zambia 36-14 in Kampala. On the Sevens front, the former international said the target will be to qualify for the Olympic Games for the third time in succession but face a stern test from South Africa with only one slot available. “ It won't be easy but we are not afraid of facing South Africa in the qualifiers. We beat them last year in the Challengers Series in Chile and we can beat them again," she added.
