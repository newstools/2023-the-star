Diamond Platnumz is ready to move on to another relationship after announcing he and Zuchu are no longer an item. In a statement, the Yatapita hitmaker said he is single and asked potential lovers to try their luck with either him or Zuchu. Diamond said potential lovers must be doing something worthwhile with their lives as the two of them don’t give out money that easily. “Together with Zuhura (Zuchu), we would like to tell you that now we are like brother and sister and not like before when most of you thought or knew we were lovers," he wrote on Instagram. Zuchu had earlier announced that she is single. The Sukari hitmaker even asked fans not to tag her in anything Diamond related. She deleted all their photos on Instagram. "Don’t tag me in his bullshit. I am single for now going forward. Thank you," she posted. Diamond then shared a cryptic message a few hours after Zuchu announced that she was single. The singer borrowed Rapper Future's photo to deliver the point home. "Put your Shawty first and watch her start taking advantage of you," reads the cryptic message. The posts came two days after the two lovebirds gushed over each other with lovely words on Valentine's day. Zuchu received a handwritten love letter from Chibu Dangote and she shared details of it with fans, saying she was deeply in love.
