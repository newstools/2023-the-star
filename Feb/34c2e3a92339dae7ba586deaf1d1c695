Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has taken former Mukurweini MP Kabando wa Kabando's exit from the party in good stride and wished him well. Kabando announced his exit on Tuesday saying he has directed the Registrar of Political Parties to delist from the party as a member. Kabando said he was leaving the party he joined in March last year as a matter of conscience and principle. "My family, confidants, allies, friends, and colleagues know of my tenacious support and trust in Martha Karua to compliment Raila Odinga in our elusive quest to rekindle a national rainbow to crash graft and impunity. I regret we've lost it. Hopefully, we'll reconnect better soon," Kabando said. To this, Karua said, "Wish you well too Au revoir (goodbye until we meet again)." Kabando said despite his exit from Narc, and by extension the Azimio camp, he will continue to boldly and independently play his patriotic part in keeping President William Ruto's government in check. "Sadly, neither ODM nor NarcK is acting institutionally in this endeavour. Cultistic politics is bad for democracy," he said. It remains unknown where the former assistant minister could be headed next. Prior to joining Narc Kenya on March 13, he had ditched Paul Muite's Safina party citing the incompatibility of the party's ideology with his political ambitions. Kabando was seeking to unseat Nyeri senator Ephraim Maina at the August polls on the Narc Kenya ticket.
