City lawyer Danstan Omari has said that the Kenya Kwanza government started a political war with retired President Uhuru Kenyatta and the opposition because they have failed to deliver. Omari said the President William Ruto-led administration has failed to deliver on their 100-day promise as per their manifesto. "They now have the instruments of power. They have not delivered anything tangible, other than the appointment of the Inspector General as an accounting officer. In terms of tangible development it's zero," he said on Wednesday during an interview on NTV. "They have gone on the political agenda because they have failed to deliver the manifesto they gave to Kenyans that within 100 days the cost of living was going to come down, electricity bills are going to come down, employment is going to be there, and hustler fund is going to be a proper fund that business people can accept." The lawyer said Kenya Kwanza accepted their failure by opting to start a political war with the opposition and the former regime. He said the tactic worked during campaigns, but they should not bank on it, now that they are officeholders. "When you look at the regime called Kenya Kwanza which has been in office for about five months since they were given power, much noise has been coming from them," Omari said. "The noise of the campaigns was demonising the Uhuru regime to be similar to the Azimio regime that was likely to come to power and that worked for the public." His remarks come against the backdrop of reports that the Kenya Kwanza government was going after former Presidents Kenyatta and Moi families over taxes. Speaking in Mombasa on Monday, Ruto had put "former powerful leaders" who have not been paying taxes on notice saying that they were coming for them.
