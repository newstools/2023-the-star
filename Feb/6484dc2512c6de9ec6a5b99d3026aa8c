Families of two police officers in Kisumu were on Tuesday forced to spend the night in the cold after their houses were razed by fire. The 8 pm incident at Shauri Moyo police line in Kisumu Central subcounty saw property of unknown value reduced to ashes. Kisumu county police commander Alphonse Kimanthi said no casualty was reported following the incident as children and the house help managed to escape unhurt. The mother of the children, an officer attached to Kisumu Central Police Station, was not in the house when the fire started. “They were lucky the gas cylinder did not explode,” one of the rescuers said. The fire was reportedly caused by a candle that children in the housing units were using to study. “Preliminary reports indicate that the fire started after the candle fell on the carpet, catching fire before it spread to other parts of the house,” Kimanthi said. The Kisumu county government firefighters rushed to the scene and managed to put off the fire before it spread to neighbouring houses in the estate. Residents from Shauri Moyo have appealed to the Kenya Red Cross and well-wishers to help the affected officers. “The officers and families need shelter, bedding and food. They have lost everything in their houses,” John Obiero, a resident, said.
