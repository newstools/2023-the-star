Singer Harmonize has denied claims he is dating again. This comes a day after a video showed the singer alighting from his Range Rover with a woman whom fans speculated was his new catch. The Konde Gang CEO, through his Insta stories, said love is part of his life. "You just can't see me with a woman? I have gone through a lot. Don't worry, I'll get a woman soon and you'll get to know her," he wrote. Harmonize further said he values the people he loves as love takes the larger part of his heart. "You might think that's stupid. Right now, I'm single. I just wanna take my time. Inshallah." The singer has been in an off-and-on relationship with different women in the past few months. His last relationship was with actress Kajala, who dumped him on Instagram. In 2021, she dumped Harmonize after it emerged that he was seducing her daughter at a time they (Harmonize and Frida) were in a romantic relationship. In 2022, Harmonize was all over social media, begging Kajala to take him back. The Konde Music Worldwide CEO went ahead to get a tattoo of Kajala's face and that of her daughter on his foot with the words “I’m sorry”. Later on, he managed to win Kajala back and after a few weeks, the two were engaged. However, towards the end of 2022, things took a different turn and the two went their separate ways.
