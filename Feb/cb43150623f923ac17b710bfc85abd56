The government will deploy the military in six bandit-prone counties where attacks have been witnessed in recent days to avert further loss of lives. Defence CS Aden Duale said in a gazette notice dated Monday, February 13 that the deployment will take effect on Wednesday. "Pursuant to Article 241 (3) (b) of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, as read with section 31 of the Kenya Defence Forces Act, 2012, notice is given that on the 15th of February, 2023, the Kenya Defence Forces shall be deployed in support of the National Police Service in response to the security emergency in Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu counties caused by rampant incidences of banditry," Duale said. The notice came hours after Interior CS Kithure Kindiki declared the counites as disturbed and dangerous. This, he said, will pave way for the planned operations against the gunmen behind attacks hiding there. Following Duale's notice, Parliament will have to sit to either approve or reject the military deployment. More than 100 civilians and 16 police officers have been brutally murdered by marauding bandits and livestock rustling terrorists in the Northern Rift Valley region of Kenya in the last six months. Hundreds of resident have been displaced from their homes following the attacks targeted at schools, police vehicles and other social amenities. Kindiki said painful and decisive measures will ultimately have to be taken immediately to avert the escalation of terror on innocent Kenyans and law enforcement agencies. “We have put in place all measures we can in our capacity as the government. We will deal with those few proud individuals and make sure no Kenyan loses their life to them,” he said.
