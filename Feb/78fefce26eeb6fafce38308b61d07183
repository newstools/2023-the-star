Ulinzi Sharks have a perfect chance to push closer to champions Nairobi Water Queens when the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league resumes this weekend at Nyayo National Stadium. Sharks, who are third on the table with 20 points behind leaders and unbeaten Water Queens (28) and National Cereals and Produce Board (22), have two matches. The soldiers face lowly Rising Star and Daystar University, teams with one win and no point respectively and are occupy the last two spots in the 12-team league. With Water Queens and NCPB having no fixtures when the teams converge again after taking an eleven-week break, the focus is on Sharks. Team manager Yusuf Kipruto said his charges have trained well and will therefore be equal to the task. He said despite not having all his players in training, he remains optimistic they will excel. “The girls have trained well and are ready. We have not played for a long period and this is worrying, but we are going for nothing short of maximum points," said Yusuf. Fourth-placed Rangers — 16 points from 11 games — will also be on show with four matches with Amazon and Kenyatta University (KU) their opponents on Saturday. Daystar University play Nairobi City Council and Net Navigators, who also have a date with Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture. On Sunday, Rangers confront fifth-placed Net Navigators in what twill be a closely contested duel. NCC will lock horns with Daystar University while New Hope meet Jkuat.
