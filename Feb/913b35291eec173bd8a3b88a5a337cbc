ODM Kisumu branch members have initiated disciplinary action against Senator Tom Ojienda who met President William Ruto at the State House. County party vice chairman Seth Kanga said Ojienda went against ODM leadership and must be disciplined. “We saw Migori Senator Eddy Okech wrote to the party officials over the same and I think the party has initiated disciplinary action and we have also initiated the same process," Kanga said. He said ODM operates within the law and the bill of rights and they will accord Ojienda his rights to a fair hearing under the chairmanship of Paul Akeyo before any action is taken. “We are a party that has its rules and regulations and actions will be taken under the rule of law," Kanga said. “Our senator went contrary to the party resolutions that we don’t recognise the Ruto-led administration yet together with another 8 MPs they visited him at State House." This comes a day after the ODM Siaya branch moved to expel Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda as the party branch secretary. "Today, members have unanimously agreed to expel the branch secretary and MP Gideon Ochanda and his position taken by East Yimbo ward MCA," Bondo ODM vice chairperson George Mawere said. The branch leadership cited Section 14(5)(a) and (e) of the political parties act, saying that "a member of a particular political party that is dining with a party that is in competition with your own party is deemed to have resigned from a party that he/she belongs to." However, Ochanda dismissed the expulsion saying he did not commit any offence to warrant any disciplinary action.
