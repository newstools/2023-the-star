Shabana coach Sammy Okoth says he is still keen on keeping top spot in the National Super League as they head for the end of the first half of the season. Shabana remain top of the table with 26 points from 12 matches despite dropping points in their last three. On Saturday, the Glamour Boys played to a barren draw against Migori Youth at Migori Stadium which Okoth said is welcome after losing their previous two. “We want to finish the first leg of the league on top of the table. From there, we can strategise on how to fight for promotion to the Kenyan Premier League,” said Okoth. “It's an important point (against Migori) after two consecutive losses,” said coach Okoth. Shabana’s next game will be against Darajani Gogo, who gunned downed second-placed Kibera Black Stars 2-0 in a Kibra derby at Camp Toyoyo. Kibera Black Stars remain second with 23 points from 12 matches. “Since our next game will be at home, it will be a must-win for us. It’s a very important game now that we have dropped points in three consecutive games,” said Okoth. He regretted the cagey affair witnessed in Migori, saying: “The players from both teams didn’t express themselves well on the pitch because of tension. This is like derby.” Migori Youth coach Kevin Oluoch said: “It was a tough match and derbies are always like that. We played well and it was a game we would have won but we did not utilize our chances. We are not in a good position at the moment.” The team has also picked 14 points from 11 outings. Meanwhile, all indications point to Shabana bringing in  four players including a goalkeeper in the month-long mid-season transfer window which opens on Monday through March 27.
