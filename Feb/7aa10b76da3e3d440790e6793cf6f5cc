Kanu secretary for political affairs Fred Okang'o has rubbished claims that the party has left the Azimio la Umoja coalition. In a statement on Monday, while responding to remarks by Makueni Senator Dan Maanzo, Okang'o said they remain firmly in the opposition coalition. Maanzo had claimed that the coalition had only two parties left, that is ODM and Wiper. "My good friend Hon Maanzo cannot say that Azimio One Kenya currently consists of only ODM and Wiper and the rest are in KK! No. We Kanu are firmly in Azimio," Okang'o said in a tweet. The Azimio party currently consists of ODM, Jubilee, Wiper, Kanu, DAP-K and Narc Kenya among other parties. Other affiliate parties left the outfit to work with Kenya Kwanza soon after Ruto was announced president. Okang'o remarks come amidst questions by Kenyans on whether the Gideon Moi-led party is still in Azimio. The party has largely shied away from participating in the anti-government rallies by the opposition. Moi's silence on the same has also been interpretedÂ as a plot to leave the opposition. On Sunday, the Wiper led by Kalonzo Musyoka affirmed that they are in the Azimio coalition to stay. Kalonzo told off the Kenya Kwanza administration over attempts to 'buy' their members to support the government. He accused Kenya Kwanza of trying to return the country to a single-party state. "In an effort to legitimise their fraud, the Executive has made many attempts to divide the Azimio-One Kenya coalition. They have openly used public institutions and resources to entice individual members "in the name of development" to break ranks with their political parties," Kalonzo said. "They have systematically tried to erode all the gains of multiparty democracy and take this nation back to a one-party state."
