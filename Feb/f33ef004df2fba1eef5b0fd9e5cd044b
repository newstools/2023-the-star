Fresh from winning the Sevilla Marathon on Sunday, Jackline Chelal has set her sights on the big city marathons later in the year. Chelal clocked 2:20:29 to win the Spainish event and has now targeted to test herself against the marathon runners in the world. "I want to test myself against the best in the world and I hope I will get invites to marathons like Berlin, Chicago or New York later in the year,” said Chelal. This being her second marathon after finishing second at the Rock and Roll Madrid Marathon in 2021, Chelal said she is getting better and better. “I'm getting better in an event that takes a lot of endurance but the more I compete, the better I become,” she said. Chelal termed the course as challenging coupled with windy conditions. “It was a tough course but I paced myself well. I was able to increase my tempo in the last seven kilometres," added Chelal. She intends to take a break before resuming training next month.
