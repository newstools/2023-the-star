Sirisia MP John Waluke has said that Jubilee MPs have withdrawn from the Azimio 'anti-Ruto' rallies terming them unnecessary. Waluke’s announcement comes after President William Ruto and his Deputy Rigathi Gachagua held a closed-door meeting with 30 Jubilee MPs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, President Ruto also met 9 ODM MPs at the State House, causing uproar and reaction from Azimio leaders. Speaking in Nairobi on Wednesday, Waluke said after meeting Ruto they have decided not to take part in the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition rallies instead they will work with the state to benefit Kenyans. “We were sent to Parliament by our people to represent and fight for their interests that is why we have withdrawn from the Azimio rallies,” Waluke said. Waluke said that currently the country has a lot of challenges and needs the elected leaders to work with the state for the benefit of the people.
