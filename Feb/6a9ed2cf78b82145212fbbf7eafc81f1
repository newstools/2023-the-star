President William Ruto has urged the European Union to fasten the process of concluding its economic partnership agreement with the East African Community. Speaking on Tuesday during the Kenya-European Union Business Council forum, Ruto said access to the EU market will enable Kenya to expand its export base and also create employment opportunities. "It is one of the notable interventions that can make a tremendous difference to our economic performance and there is an excellent reason, in the EUâ€™s best interests, to conclude the deals," he said. The President added that doing business with Kenya is strategic and highly beneficial in many ways. Ruto noted that despite agriculture being the highest job-creating sector, exporters still face challenges with quality standards and infrastructure among others. He said this hinders productivity, but he believes with regular consultation with the EU players, such barriers can be overcome. "I believe that continued consultations and collaboration can unlock these barriers and smoothen the path for stronger trade relationships." Ruto also highlighted some of the key priority areas he has worked on to make the country a business-friendly destination. "We have an open, liberal and business-friendly regulatory regime underpinned by a strong reputation for the rule of law. I wish to confirm to you that I have made progress in implementing undertakings to pursue solutions," he said. "The Kenya Revenue Authority is less arbitrary and more rational in executing its mandate and now pursues alternative dispute resolution with a firm and fair focus on optimising revenue collection." The Head of State assured the forum that the police are now independent and they are working to ensure that the judiciary reaches Kenyans at the grassroots. The President was accompanied by cabinet secretaries Moses Kuria (Trade) and Alfred Mutua (Foreign Affairs).
