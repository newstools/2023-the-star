Nairobi Water volleyball coach John Mwaniki said the league returnees will look to impress when they tackle Directorate of Criminal Investigations and Nairobi Prisons in this weekend's matches at Nyayo Stadium. Water last featured in the league in 2017 and Mwaniki, a former Post Bank tactician, hopes all departments will click in their bid to get results. "We cannot run away from the fact that we are newcomers. The aim is to play well and the rest will follow. If all departments coordinate, we will put ourselves in a better position to fight with our rivals," Mwaniki said. Team captain Ruth Chelangat was bullish of their chances, adding that preparations have been thorough and the mood in camp has been superb. "It is obvious we have been in the cold for five years but that does not mean we are pushovers. We will only gauge our performance after the weekend assignment," said Chelangat. The team will be banking on the experience of Nancy Mulonza (right attacker), Meresa Amayo (middleblocker), Elizabeth Wagichi (left attacker) as well as Chelangat. New players are also tipped to play a crucial role as the Water Queens prepare for a grueling season. Among them are Modesta Chepchirchir (middleblocker — formerly of KCB), Gladys Wanjiru — who was roped in from DCI —  and the duo of liberos Naomi Simiyu and Everlyne Mmbone. "We just need to cope with our rivals who have been in action all through. The one-month preparation the team has had is sufficient. We feel we are ready to rub shoulders with the best," said Chelangat. She added that consistency in training is a big boost to the team. "We are training at the City Stadium from Monday to Friday and the group looks inspired."
