The Kitui assembly has backtracked on its decision to reject the CEC nominee for education and skills development Joyce Titus. On Tuesday, during a special sitting in the assembly, the MCAs unanimously endorsed the nomination of Titus. The session was presided over by speaker Kevin Katisya. Before breaking for Christmas, the assembly rejected Titus, who was one of the 10 people Kitui Governor Julius Malombe had picked for nomination as CECs. The assembly passed nine of Malombe's picks but rejected Titus on ground her name, as in the identity documents, was different from the name submitted by Malombe. The name presented by Governor Malombe was Joyce Kasyoka Masila, which was different from the one on the document presented by the nominee during vetting. The committee's report after vetting the nominee also noted that she had failed to demonstrate knowledge of topical, administrative and technical issues on the docket she had been nominated to head. After her rejection, Malombe penned a memorandum to Katisya requesting the assembly review the decision. On January 30, Titus was subjected to a second vetting by the assembly committee on appointments. She came armed with an affidavit indicating that her name was Joyce Titus. After the vetting, the appointment committee wrote a favourable reportÂ  on the nominee. The committee presented its report to the assembly and was subsequently adopted on Tuesday by the house. On the same day, the assembly also approved all the 26 persons Malombe had nominated for the position of chief officer. Since he took office in August last year, Malombe has been operating with the county executives and chief officers he had inherited from his predecessor Charity Ngilu. The new 10 Kitui county executive committee members and 26 chief officers will be sworn into office on Wednesday, February 8.
