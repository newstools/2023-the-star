Rayvanny and Harmonize seem to have patched things. The two ex-WCB artistes have now followed each other on social media weeks after they threw shade at each other. Harmonize is said to have been the one who started following the singer on Instagram. Rayvanny returned the kind gesture by following back. The two first threw blows at each other after Harmonize said artistes should stop releasing alcohol-praising songs. "Wasanii punguzeni nyimbo za pombe. Msidhani hii nchi kila mtu ni mlevi. Hata tuokunywanga Jumatatu hatunywi tukiskiliza nyimbo za pombe," Harmonize said. Rayvanny hit back. "Huna ngoma ya pombe iliowahi kuhit, sasa utaongea nini kuhusu mawe ya pombe? Shut the f** up," he replied.
