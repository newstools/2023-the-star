City hall has commenced plans to relocate hawkers in Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD) to their new areas of operations. Last week, a team from the city hall started marking working areas of trading to be used by hawkers in various lanes within CBD. The exercise is spearheaded by Markets Director Joyce Kyengo who led the team in a tour of the various spaces. She said the governor has approved businesses set up in the back lanes. “Governor Sakaja wants small-time traders to flourish under his leadership, but he also wants order in the city. It is also to ensure they trade in a dignified manner,” Kyengo added. She revealed that the county will install electricity, erect sheds as well as improve the working conditions of the traders. At least 6,000 hawkers have registered with the county. Last year, Sakaja announced that hawkers will occupy 29 streets and backlash within the CBD. “We did public participation with the hawkers and the leadership in CBD, we have marked 29 streets and back lanes that we are already preparing, Dubois road is the first one which will be the model street,” he said. Other areas earmarked for paint works include Sotik, Turkana, Posta and Kirinyaga. During his campaigns last year, Sakaja said his administration would not demolish markets or chase hawkers from their bases of operations. He promised to construct 20 new markets across Nairobi including Ngara and ensure that every trader is allocated a space. In October 2021, the county government invited members of the public to give their views on hawking within the CBD. In a gazette notice dated October 14, county secretary Jairus Musumba invited all interested parties including the hawkers to give their views in scheduled meetings.
