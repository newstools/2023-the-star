The Nairobi Business Community has cautioned opposition politicians against leading demonstrations in the city to compel the government to heed to any of their demands. The chairman of the group, Wilfred Kamau, warned that the demonstrations would be a recipe for chaos and lawlessness. “Should they put their threats to practice, we want to assure them that we are not moved. They will meet the Nairobi Business Community ready to resist them with equal measure,” he said. Kamua nonetheless called on the government to protect their businesses in the event of opposition protests. Addressing a press conference at a hotel in the city, he said they are dismayed by utterances being peddled by some opposition politicians and warned that such sentiments are a recipe for chaos and lawlessness. They said elections are over and people want to move on with their daily businesses without interference from “maandamano.” “We want President William Ruto and his deputy Rigathi Gachagua to be given space to serve Kenyans,” Ndung’u Wachira, a trader said. “We heard some MCA say that they will close businesses. That is hogwash. Those are uncalled-for utterances from an elected leader." Wachira further said opposition leaders should refrain from insulting Ruto and his deputy. “Just come out of your dreams of occupying State House and start focusing on how you will win the 2027 elections if you are lucky,” he said. Azimio leader Raila Odinga has announced a series of rallies to protest against the Kenya Kwanza government during his rally at Jacaranda gardens on Sunday, January 29. He said the next rally will be in Kibera, Nairobi before he goes to Machakos town and other parts of the country including Nakuru, Kakamega, Kiambu, Isiolo, Kisii Kisumu, Mombasa, Garissa, and Turkana counties before another mega rally in Nairobi.
