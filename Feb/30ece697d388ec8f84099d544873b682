The home of former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i was on Wednesday evening broken into by police officers. The officers were reportedly looking for CCTV footage on the alleged home raid on February 8. Photos show broken gate locks and interior doors at the former CS's house. DCI Mohamed Amin said they obtained a search order to obtain the CCTV recordings from the home. Matiang'i's lawyer DanstanÂ Omari however said the police were denied court orders to access the former interior CS. "Out of frustration they drive here in a military form without a court order, get inside the house of the former CS and ransacked his house," he said.
