Strathmore Leos coach Louis Kisia has termed Saturday's varsity showdown against Mean Machine as pivotal in their race for Kenya Cup survival. Last season's Kenya Cup semifinalists have had an underwhelming campaign to sit 11th on the log with 13 points with three wins and six defeats, a far cry from last season — where they were flying high in the top four. The tactician expects a competitive match against Machine but remains confident of picking a win. “It's been a topsy-turvy season for us but I have had a good week of training and the boys are fired up. We know Machine will come out guns blazing since they are also fighting for survival but our tactical acumen and strategy will be key," added Kisia. The former Mwamba coach said the side is in transition following the departure of some of their mainstays including Andrew Matoka, who earned a scholarship in the USA, Bethuel Anami  (professional contract in France), George Ooro (now with Shujaa alongside Brunson Madigu) and losing Festus Shiasi to KCB. “It has not been easy integrating the new players but they are learning very fast and come next season, they will be in a better position,” added Kisia. Kisia said the game will be  won upfront in the forward battle an area he thinks his side have an edge over their rivals. “Our forward pack has been good and if we can dominate the scrum and lineout as well win the collisions, then we will have a platform to win the match,”observed Kisia. Key players for the Madaraka-based side will be Ian Masheti, Nick Ongeri, Gabriel Ayimba and Max Atera in the forwards with Stephen Osumba, Arnold Muita and Shem Okola the key actors in the backline. Strathmore's final game of the season will be against Quins next Saturday at the RFUEA round.
