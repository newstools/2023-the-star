Housing and Urban Planning PS  Charles Hinga has proposed the introduction of taxation on idle land. Hinga said this will deter owners of idle land from holding the lands for speculative purposes. He spoke on Friday during the  Senate Induction Retreat of Roads, Transportation and Housing in Naivasha, Nakuru. The move, Hinga, added, will force the land owners to either develop the plots or sell them to commercial developers. The PS said land prices in the Capital are among the highest in the world as owners hold them as they speculate and wait for prices to rise. Further, Hinga proposed the relocation of prisons built in the heart of major urban centres to create room for the affordable housing project. He said 92 per cent of Nairobi residents live in rented houses due to lack of affordable housing plan. The PS pointed out that the project will get rid of the mushrooming of informal settlements. Since taking power, the President William Ruto-led administration has launched several affordable housing projects across the country,  translating to about 26,788 housing units. Hinga said in May, the government is expected to launch three more projects in Makongeni, Starehe and Thika. They will have 50,000 housing units. Under the National Development Plan, Vision 2030, the government targets to provide 200,000 housing units annually for all income levels.
