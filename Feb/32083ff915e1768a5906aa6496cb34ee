Foreign Affairs CS Alfred Mutua will support Mombasa Governor Abdulswamad Nassir's plan to airlift 1500 Mombasa youth to seek opportunities abroad. The two met on Friday at the governor's office after the four-day post-election conference that was held in the county. Mutua said the issue of overseas jobs for Mombasa youth was a major issue of discussion. "Already, Nassir has a program to airlift 1,500 youth for employment," Mutua said. The duo agreed on the modalities and sustainability of the plan. "Our technical teams will be meeting from early next week to expedite the process," the CS said. The two also discussed how to leverage Mombasa as the gateway of Kenya and to market the county for investments, tourism and employment opportunities. "Traditional tourism is good, but it has to evolve to keep up with modern times," Mutua said. They also resolved that Mombasa can be a major attraction as a destination entertainment centre. Mutua said Kenya is being transformed into a major film-making destination, the duo will work to influence foreign film writers from all over the world to include Mombasa in their scripts. He pledged to facilitate, together with other departments, film crews to work seamlessly in Kenya. "It was encouraging to share ideas that will change the lives of the people," he said.
