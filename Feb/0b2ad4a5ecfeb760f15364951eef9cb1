A 50-year-old man has been hacked to death in Kegochi Nyamache, Kisii, following a scuffle over a hoe he had lent his son. The deceased, James Orwenyo, had gone to check on his son James Maguto, to request his jembe back when he was killed. Area assistant chief Enoch Mauti said there was a brief altercation between the two when the son picked a hoe and hacked him. He died on the spot. Agnes Ogega, his sister, said Maguto had a history of mental illness. "My dad often goes to check on him. Today he only went to ask for the jembe which he had taken, that is the time he killed him," she said Police from Nyamache recovered the jembe from the scene. Investigations into the incident have began. The body was taken to Nyamache Hospital mortuary.
