Detectives on Thursday visited the scene of crime where a junior staff at the NHIF was killed on Monday. The move by detectives from the DCI's forensic ballistics section is part of the probe to triangulate the probable location of the sniper. Lilian Waithera, an NHIF employee at the registry department, was shot on Monday evening as she walked downtown from the Upper Hill offices. Witnesses and police said she started to complain of chest pain as she walked, then collapsed and lost her breath. Her colleagues who were with her called an ambulance which arrived in time but the responders declared her dead at the scene. Her body was moved from Nairobi Hospital to Kenyatta University mortuary where a post-mortem by a group of pathologists found the cause of death as shooting. Initially, police and pedestrians believed that Waithera collapsed and died from natural causes but a bullet was found lodged in her lungs during the postmortem. The bullet was fired from an elevated angle and went into the body through the collarbone before stopping in the lungs. Nairobi regional police commander Adamson Bungei said the bullet is in the custody of ballistic experts for analysis.
