Alice Owiti and Aurelia Opondo scored for Lakers as the Kenyans beat Army Ladies of Ghana 2-0 at the ongoing African Club Championships at the City Park Stadium on Wednesday. Lakers, who are debuting at the annual competition, were a class act and dictated the game from the second quarter to the end. Owiti and Opondo scored in the 15th and 42nd minutes respectively to give the Kisumu-based side their second win in the week-long competition. The win saw the Austin Tuju-coached Lakers top the log with seven points, a point better off than second-placed Army. In the men’s category, Ghana Revenue Authority beat Moshi Khalsa from Tanzania 10-1. The trio of Courage Boyefio, Ernest Opoku and Godsway Adae all grabbed braces. Luke Kofi, Joshua Kwaku, Assah Akwasio and Christopher Dogbe managed one goal apiece. James Paulo scored a consolation for Moshi. Elsewhere, Nigeria’s Police Machine silenced Zimbabwe’s Hippo 4-2. Henry Olanyinka scored a hattrick for Machine in the third, 16th and 47th minutes respectively. Sunday Orinya also got himself on the scoresheet in the 43rd minute. Gift Chomunorwa and Tatenda Kanyangarara found the back of the net for Hippo.
