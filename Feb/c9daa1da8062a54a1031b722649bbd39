Lakers hockey captain Alice Owiti believes the Kisumu based side is ready to fight for the Women's Premier League title in the coming season. Lakers finished fourth in the African Cup for Club Championship last weekend and missed a  podium place on goal difference. They were the highly ranked Kenyan team in the category, finishing fourth out of the seven teams. This was also Lakers' first appearance in the annual continental championship. "Being beaten on goal difference for a podium finish is yet to sink in on us. I believe this is a consistent improvement and we can only get better in the course of time. The ACCC was a first for most of us and we did extremely well against seasoned teams," Owiti observed. Blazers and Strathmore scorpions finished fifth and sixth respectively. Lakers claimed third position in the league last season. In the 2019 season upon their debut in the top-tier league, Lakers settled for  fourth place. The team, coached by Austin Tuju, has risen above challenges since it's inception in 2017. "We have what it takes to win the league title in the coming season. The ACCC experience will come in handy," Owiti who plays as a forward said. "It also opened us to new ways of play and allowed us to learn the weaknesses we have both on individual and as a team." She also weighed in on the financial troubles affecting Lakers. "Our major challenge was the monetary requirements that negatively worked on our psyche for most of the tournament. We are a self sponsored team. We depend on gifts, donations and contributions from well-wishers. We had a difficult time meeting the financial obligations of the competition but all in all I was satisfied with our performance."
