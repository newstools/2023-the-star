Inasmuch as the term cyber bullying has been mentioned over and over again and it's effects highlighted, many continue practising it. This has various effects on the victims. Cyber bullying refers to the act of harassment using electronic means. It can be done through social media platforms such as Facebook WhatsApp and Twitter and also through email messages. Sending life threatening and violent words is also a form of bullying that must come to an end. According to a BBC report at the weekend, Chelsea manager Graham Potter has been receiving such messages through his email address and this has affected him mentally. His family has also been affected. Mental health is key to a person's wellbeing. Circulation of demeaning information about someone affects them psychologically. Measures have been put in place to combat cyber bullying but it seems not to be taken seriously. More measures should be applied to ensure everyone gets to enjoy and live life without getting bullied. Everyone has a right to live freely and cyber bullying is a crime that should be punishable. Cyber security is key to ensuring that this issue do not keep recurring and people should be protected on the internet. Francisco Muhonja is a student at Rongo University
