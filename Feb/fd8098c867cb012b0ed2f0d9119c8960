Reigning Commonwealth 3,000m steeplechase champion Abraham Kibiwot will use this weekend's Athletics Kenya meeting at the Nyayo Stadium to gauge his speed as his preparations for the new season intensify. Kibiwott said he will be competing in the 1,500m race as he plans to have a go at honours in upcoming events including Kip Keino Classic, Rabat Diamond League in Morocco and the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary later in the year. Two weeks ago, Kibiwott competed in the 5,000m race at the build-up leg in Kisumu, which he  was using to gauge his endurance. “I ran 5,000m to gauge my endurance and heading to Nairobi, I want to run 1,500m for speed. This is part of my preparations as I prepare for the  major upcoming championships,” said Kibiwot. “I’m training well but still unfit for competitions. My plan is to start the year at the Diamond League in Rabat come May, so it is still far. My body is not badly off but I have to look for fitness,” he added. After missing a medal last year in Oregon, Kibiwott feels he has a chance at the Budapest event in August. “My prayer is to win a medal at the World Championships after missing a medal last year. I did not run a tactical race. I will rectify last year’s mistakes and hopefully, bag a medal. Kenya should expect a medal from me in Budapest,” added Kibiwot who trains in Mosoriot, Nandi County under coach Japhter Keter.
