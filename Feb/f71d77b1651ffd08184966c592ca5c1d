Kenya's preparation for the Paris Olympics 2024 and the safety of athletes took centre stage during a meeting between World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) Africa director Rodney Swigelaar and the National Olympic Committee of Kenya on Monday. Swigelaar emphasized the need to trust the system and innovation to curb the doping menace ahead of Paris 2024. The conversation also covered various areas of NOCK's development priorities as well as ADAK’S challenges. The two parties discussed the huge role Kenya plays in representing Africa. As the top country in the Olympics, all eyes will be on Kenya to better its Tokyo 2020 performance, according to Swigelaar, who was accompanied by the Anti-doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) chief executive officer,  Sarah Shibutse. “I’m glad and proud that Kenya signed an MOU with the city of Miramas this past weekend to kickstart early preparations towards the Games. I am also pleased that the country's leadership team for Paris 2024  Games is already in place," he said. Chef de Mission Paris 2024, Shadrack Maluki, Nock's second vice chairman, Waithaka Kioni, and athletes' representative Humphrey Kayange were present during the meeting. Kayange thanked Swigelaar for visiting the country and representing the world body at such a crucial time. “As athletes, most times we lack knowledge on matters doping or the people surrounding us don’t guide us well enough. We’re glad to have the Africa director here to hear not only from the government but also from the athletes.”
