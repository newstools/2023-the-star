Ijara MP Abdi Ali has appealed to the government to set up a Huduma centre in Masalani town to save residents from the hustle of travelling to Garissa to seek services. Residents of Ijara travel about 200 kilometres whenever they want to access critical services. “The establishment of Huduma centres proved to be a creative masterstroke by the Jubilee government under President Uhuru Kenyatta [now retired]. It has completely changed the lives of Kenyans for the better. But Ijara residents are yet to fully enjoy its benefits,” Ali said. He was speaking in Masalani town during the homecoming ceremony of EALA MP Falhada Iman Dekow.   Public Service, Gender and Affirmative Action CS Aisha Jumwa was present. MP Ali said that among the agreements he signed between his party (NAP-K) and Kenya Kwanza was to build a Huduma centre in the constituency. “As we speak we are far from Hola, Garissa and Lamu. Our people are forced to use a lot of money travelling to access important services. Sometimes they have to spend several nights in Garissa and it is really inconveniencing,” he said. “I have faith in the Kenya Kwanza government that it will deliver on this promise. The President is not only a performer but one who keeps his word.” Jumwa said the Kenya Kwanza government was committed to ensuring that services are brought closer to the people and assured the MP the request will be considered for implementation.
