More than 7,000 teachers recently promoted to junior secondary schools are expected to report to their respective duty stations today. Teachers Service Commission okayed the elevation of the teachers to teach in JSS following the successful verification of their personal files. Applications were made through an online portal provided by TSC. The applicants were to meet specific qualifications which include Diploma in Education, Bachelor's Degree in Education and at least a C+ (plus) in KCSE or its equivalent. C+(plus) in the two teaching subjects at KCSE, or its equivalent, as well as eight units in each of the two teaching subjects was part of the requirement. Commissionâ€™s CEO Nancy Macharia told Parliament that the 7,282 teachers have been distributed to different counties based on the number of classes. The deployment comes at a time most schools are grappling with numerous challenges which include congestion as a result of limited infrastructures to host the learners. About 30,550 primary school teachers were distributed to teach Grade 7 pupils across the country. "Each teacher has two subjects and we realised that most of the Grade 7 subjects have a sort of correlation," Macharia told MPs last week. This means, one teacher can teach more than one subject at the JSS level. She also clarified that since 2019 the commission has been promoting primary school teachers to teach in secondary schools. "The mapping process is continuous and verification is still ongoing to identify more teachers to be posted," she said.
