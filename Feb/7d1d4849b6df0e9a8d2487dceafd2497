A Kisumu court has sentenced two people to three years in prison or pay a fine of Sh50,000 each for assault. Elijah Oduor and Richard Otieno, alias Oboke, were found guilty by Winam senior resident magistrate Chrispine Ouro. Oduor and Otieno were charged with attacking and causing grievous bodily harm on Collins Odhiambo on September 29, 2020, in Manyatta, Kisumu Central subcounty. Odhiambo told the court that Oduor hit him with a hockey stick while Otieno descended on him with blows and kicks. The court heard that Odhiambo lost consciousness after the attack and was rushed to the Jaramogi Oginga Teaching and Referral Hospital where he was operated on. Dr Lucy Ombok, who filed a P3 form, told the court the complainant had injuries to the head. She said Odhiambo could not see properly using the right eye due to trauma. The medic said Odhiambo was hit with a blunt object. Ouro said the prosecution proved its case against the two and delivered a verdict of guilty. Oduor and Otieno pleaded for leniency. But magistrate Ouro ordered them to pay Sh50,000 each or serve three years jail in default.
