Gospel singer and preacher Linet Munyali, popular as Size 8 Reborn, has launched her church, Christ Revealed Ministries, named after her debut album. Size 8 was ordained as a pastor in 2021 and is currently serving God in the best way she knows how. She told Buzzroom that prayer meetings and services, for now, are on Fridays from 5pm, and entry is free to all who would like to be blessed. "Yes, Christ Revealed Ministries is a newly founded church ministry by God's will, and by God's grace, it will run till Jesus Christ returns," Size 8 said. The singer ditched the secular industry after being born again in April 2013, rebranding to Size 8 Reborn, from Size 8.
