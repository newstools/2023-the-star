President William Ruto has said the government will disburse county funds on time. Ruto said the move will expedite devolution and smoothen service delivery. “There is evidence that transformation has come about through devolution and as such, we must support counties,” he said. Ruto also said the devolved units of administration are at the centre of Kenya’s development, pledging to work closely with counties. "I will scale up our partnership, particularly in agriculture, security, health and housing," he said. He spoke during the 9th National and County Coordinating Summit in Naivasha. During the summit, they also discussed constitutional affairs, devolution of functions and resources. Other topics discussed were critical bills concerning county governments, audit reports and court cases between the two levels of government. Also present during the summit were Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula, Senate Speaker Amason Kingi and Attorney General Justin Muturi.
