Learners joining Kereri Girls in Kisii have been required to shave their heads before admission. The Star has learnt that learners who had long hair had to be attended to by the standby barbers who were set for the windfall. The school is said to have a policy requiring all students to shave their hair. "Welcome Kereri Girls, to the girls who are here for the admission process and you have long here, it is the school's policy that you get shaved," a proclamation was heard in a video seen by the Star. "To my left, there is a barber please proceed there to get assistance. Thank you." The video has elicited mixed reactions from Kenyans with some wondering why some secondary schools allow long hair while others do not. "Students shouldn't be shaved bald with the hot sun. The hair protects the skin. Sad that we still encourage this nonsense," Kileleshwa MCA Robert Alai said. "Another problem with our Kenyan schools, is instead of focusing on the mental health and welfare of students they focus on the physical issues, "a head that is perfectly shaved but poor mental health is like a 2023 model range rover without an engine"," dev { GithinjiWaRuby}Â  tweeted. "This should not be a rule for any school," one Em-E said. Akoth Nyakwar Abely on her part tweeted: "This is just not right. you wonder what hair got to do with learning".
