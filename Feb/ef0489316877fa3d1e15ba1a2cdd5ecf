Teachers in Malindi have been urged to seek ways to improve education in the constituency. Kilifi Education executive Clara Chonga raised concerns that students are not performing well even in subjects such as IRE, Kiswahili and Geography. “I urge teachers to ensure schools record better performance in the future," she said. Chonga spoke at Barani Secondary School during a prize giving ceremony for teachers and schools that performed well in the KCPE and KCPE exams. The event was organised by Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi. Twenty-nine teachers were awarded. They received cash and trophies. Present were Kilifi Deputy Governor Flora Chibule, Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza, Kilifi Woman Rep Getrude Mbeyu, MCA Rashid Odhiambo and national government officials. Chibule said Mnyazi had set the pace for recognising best performing teachers and urged Chonga to implement the initiative across the county to boost teachers' morale. She said the county will take the initiative a notch higher by recognising the best performing teachers and schools in all the seven subcounties. Mnyazi said she came up with the initiative to appreciate teachers who spend a lot of time with the students, even more than their parents. “It’s important to appreciate our teachers for the work they are doing,” she said. “I know we have so many challenges, but right now you [teachers] have the goodwill of leaders and we are ready to cooperate with you on matters education,” Mnyazi said. MCA Odhiambo said,“We need As in Malindi. In Kilifi, there are few As, which makes it difficult for our children to get good courses after secondary school."
