Nzawa Primary school, a learning centre in Nguutani ward, Mwingi West of Kitui is among schools hardly hit by drought. The area received very minimal rainfall hence residents who majorly survive on farming didn't harvest anything. Following drought that has hit hard the area, school-age children are on the verge of dropping out of schools. Nzawa Primary School head teacher Jackson Kioko said the number of pupils in the school is slowly decreasing due to hunger, adding that poor performance might be witnessed. "We are staring at a possible massive dropouts and poor performance if the government doesn't distribute food to schools," Kioko said. The head teacher said the Junior Secondary School and the Competency-Based Curriculum are facing a challenge that calls for the government's intervention. He said after a consultative meeting with parents, they agreed to be contributing food for the children. However, tough economic times occasioned by minimal rainfall in the area have made the parents lack food to bring to school for their children. "The food ended last term but no single parent has brought food again, times are hard," he said. Kioko further said they have since been forced to look for alternative means of survival where the school administration has resulted to cooking porridge for the children. "Many come to school having eaten nothing, the porridge we serve them is at least a boost to them to concentrate in class," he said. Mbiti King'auwi, the school cook, has since lost his job. He said he no longer reports to work as there's nothing to cook for the children. "I hugely depended on this job but I am helpless now," King'auwi said. He called on the government to intervene and save the situation. Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna said he will table a motion on the floor of the National Assembly for the reintroduction of school feeding programme. "Every part of Kitui is ailing, I call upon Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua to act with immediate effect," he said.
