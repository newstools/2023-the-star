Edday Nderitu, wife to Mugithi musician Samuel Muchoki alias Samidoh's wife has taken to social media to blast him following an alleged love affair. Through an emotional post, Edday said she will not raise her children in a polygamous family. “I have said to you and I am saying here again I will not raise my kids in a polygamy family, especially with a woman who is older than me by more than 10 years,” she said. Edday also said her marriage has been full of pain for the past three years, adding that she is the one who helped the musician nature his talent. “I have remained faithful to you regardless of disrespect, humiliation and being trolled on social media. You’ve made me look dumb and took my silence for granted, I have helped you nature your talent and supported you through it all,” she said. “I have asked God every day to give me strength to pray for you but today I have nothing to tell God about you, you have dragged and put me and my kids in an ocean of pain may you remember this day." Her social media outburst comes barely two months after a drama that was experienced in Dubai between her and nominated Senator Karen Nyamu. Karen Nyamu and Edday Nderitu almost went physical during Samidoh's  Mugiithi show in Dubai on December 16, 2022. Drama started when Karen went straight to where Samidoh was seated and forcefully sat on his lap. Edday, stood from where she was seated and went and grabbed her husband's hand even as the security guards tried to separate the two women. A video circulating online shows Karen Nyamu and Samidoh in a confrontation. And minutes later, Karen is said to have lost her cool and almost slapped her baby daddy when his bouncers intervened. Edday stood up and tried to grab Karen away from her husband before Karen was taken away by the guards.
