Kuria West subcounty police have increased crackdown on illicit drugs by impounding bhang worth Sh3 million and arresting a traditional brewer in two separate incidents. Area police boss Cleti Kimaiyo said his officers acted on a tip-off that a Tanzanian registered motorbike had crossed into the country through the Isebania border post. Police trailed the suspect who left the motorbike and ten sacks of marijuana weighing 300 kilogrammes in a maize plantation. The motorbike was taken to the Isebania police station. “We did not arrest the suspect and already we have contacted our Tanzanian counterparts to help us with investigations,” Kimaiyo told the Star on Tuesday. In a separate incident, Kimaiyo said police arrested another 30-year-old woman for being in possession of 110 litres of Kangara. He said police conducted a raid in Bukumber location and arrested the suspect. “We are keen to end illicit brew and drugs, especially across the border in Tanzania, we will rely more on intelligence to nab suspects,” he said.
