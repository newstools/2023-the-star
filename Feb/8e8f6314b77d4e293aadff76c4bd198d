If you want to end up in a successful marriage, preserve yourself, says life coach and psychologist Benjamin Zulu. You lower your chances when you expose yourself for empty promises, he said on YouTube. "You cannot be giving yourself to someone for free then hoping another person will come along and pay full price for the same thing, committing himself exclusively to you, paying the price culturally and socially," he said. The life coach said his advice is not only limited to chastity but rather character and maturity. He said this did not only apply to women only but men, too. When a man who has prepared himself is ready for a long life commitment, he will also want a woman who was preparing herself for the same, he said.
