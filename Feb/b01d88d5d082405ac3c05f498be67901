Three-time world cross country champion Geoffrey Kamworor and world 3,000m steeplechase record holder Beatrice Chepkoech will highlight the second edition of Sirikwa Classic on Saturday at the Lobo Village in Kapseret, Uasin Gishu county. Kamworor, who is also a double New York City Marathon champion, has already been named for the World Cross Country Championships in Bathurst, Australia. During the Sirikwa event, he will lead the senior men’s 10km race in the event that is part of the World Cross Country Golden Tour. Speaking at the venue on Wednesday, the race's chief executive officer, Barnaba Korir said the duo will spice up the event now that the Golden Tour is being hosted on the home soil. “We are going to have Kamworor and Chepkoech, who will be competing in this race. As the host nation, we want to have one of the best competitive races ever," said Korir. He added that Kamworor and Chepkoech have already confirmed participation as preparations for the race continue to gather momentum with the event three days away. He said they have enlisted both local and international athletes from different nationalities to battle it out for top honours. Athletes from at least 30 nations have already confirmed participation in the event, where the winners in the senior races will walk away with US$6000. Kamworor will be marshaling forces for Kenya in Bathurst alongside Sebastian Kimaru (Kapsabet), Daniel Simiu (Police), Kibiwott Kandie (KDF), Emmanuel Kiprop (Golazo) and Nicholas Kipkorior (Police). Local Organising Committee (LOC) chairman Ibrahim Hussein affirmed that preparations for the event are 90 percent complete. He explained that the race had to be reverted to its initial name after last year's edition was named in honour of the late Agnes Tirop.
