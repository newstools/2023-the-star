Recho Elias, the now popular video Vixen in Diamond's song Zuwena, has said she is under 18. Her fans don't believe it and took to social media to express their doubts. Leonard Ndorox said, "She is right according to her country but when we come to our country (Kenya) that could be 35." Fridah Kainda Ngai said Diamond looked younger than her. In an interview with a television station in Tanzania, Zuwena said many people do not believe her when she says she is still a teenager. The beauty revealed that she is only 17 years old and she does not even have a national identity card nor has she been allowed to participate in some social affairs as legally she is still a minor. "I'm only 17 years old. I'm still fresh, what do you think? This 17 has a very big secret for the beautiful Recho Elias! You are protesting whether you have seen the clinic card or you want me to give it to you?" she told the announcer who seemed incredulous. Recho was paid TSh17 million (KSh913,028) to feature in Zuwena. The song tells a heartwarming tale about death, loss and grief. It is the story of a woman whose life takes a dark turn following the death of her spouse. Her brother-in-law is in a conversation with his late brother about the new woman 'Zuwena' has become, and all the hardships she has put them through.
