Equity Bank Dumas coach Carey Oketch said they must take care of their own situation if they want to win games. The tactician said they learnt great lessons from their weekend tour of Eldoret and Kisumu and will use them to prepare for their upcoming games. Equity Bank went down 78-77 to Eldonets Platinum and squeezed a hard fought 63-61 win against Lakeside in Kisumu the following day. “We have to take care of our opportunities. We can’t go 24/64 from field goals and 18/35 from the charity stripe. That is unacceptable,” said Oketch. He said they will put more emphasis on their remaining matches, against Ulinzi Warriors, Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya University. ‘Pirates’. “If we take care of our field goals, free throws, rebound well and reduce on our turn-overs, we will be good to go,” he said. Despite the slip up, Dumas are still perched at the top of the table with 35 points, three ahead of second-placed Ulinzi Warriors. Meanwhile, KU coach Caleb Osewe said his boys must win their remaining games to avoid ‘mathematics’ going into the play-offs. On Sunday, ‘Pirates’ turned the tide to defeat Zetech University ‘Titans’ 57-40 after taking a close 26-20 half time effort. “We have no choice but to win the remaining matches if we are to make it to the playoffs,” said Osewe. In the Lower Division, Strathmore University hit Swift 42-23, Western Delight hit Footprints 37-36 before falling 45-41 to Scarlet. In the men’s edition, United States International University beat Moi Air Base 54-48 as Feba dimmed Hope 64-53.
