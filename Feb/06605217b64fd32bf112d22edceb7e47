Homa Bay has recorded some suspected cases of cholera after 12 people reportedly showed symptoms of the disease. The new cases were reported in three villages in the West Kasipul ward in the Kasipul constituency. The villages are Kokelo and Kasire in the Kodera North location and Nyimbi in the Konuong’a location. The patients were rushed to Rangwe dispensary in West Kasipul after developing stomachaches before passing watery diarrhoea and vomiting. Upon examination, they showed suspected signs and symptoms of cholera, like diarrhoea, stomachache, vomiting and joint pain among others. Homa Bay Health executive Roselyn Omollo said in a statement that they were putting measures in place to manage the disease. “The twelve people have been diagnosed with the symptoms of cholera. We're undertaking contract tracing in the affected villages as a measure of controlling the disease,” Omollo said. She asked residents to be on high alert for the prevention of the disease. The measures include drinking clean and treated water, washing hands regularly with soap and running water. Others include eating warm cooked food. The incident occurred on Sunday but so far five people have been discharged. “We urge residents to maintain hygiene as a way of keeping the disease at bay,” she said. On January 9, the county recorded eight cases of cholera. The number escalated to 16 about four days later. They were treated at various health facilities including Homa Bay County Referral hospital before being discharged. No death was reported. The county referral hospital chief executive officer Peter Ogolla said cholera patients normally get dehydrated due to loss of water. He said they are ready with isolation tents which would be set up for handling patients with the disease. Precautionary measures are being taken to minimise further infection. “We must understand that cholera can be a fetal and patients are encouraged to seek medication as fast as possible,” Ogolla said.
