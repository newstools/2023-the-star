A police officer and seven City Hall askaris were Tuesday arrested over the destruction of a public school perimeter wall on Juja Road, Nairobi. The group had gone to Racecourse Primary School and demolished the wall saying it was illegally constructed. The wall had been erected through the Starehe Constituency Development Fund programme. The school administration reported the matter to the police prompting the action. It was then that the officer who is attached to City Hall and the seven askaris were arrested while in action. The group was armed with pangas, two spades, a jembe and a mattock. Police said they are investigating the motive of the attack before charging the group. Locals said the wall had been in contention over claims it encroached a private property, a claim police said they are investigating and require a court ruling. Such incidents of malicious damage to property by the county askaris have been on the rise. Authorities say some of the askaris have been arrested and charged with the offence in past incidents.
