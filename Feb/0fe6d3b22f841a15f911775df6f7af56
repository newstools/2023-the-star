With Nondescripts confirmed as the KRU Championship regular season winners, attention now shifts to the second and third positions with one game to go. Nondies have an unassailable 48 points, having won all their 10 games while newbies Daystar University Falcons are second with 39. Former Kenya Cup side Kisumu RFC are third with 36 points, two ahead of fourth-placed South Coast Pirates. Bottom-placed teams, Zetech University Oaks and Eldoret RFC, have already been relegated to the Nationwide League. The two teams won just a game each, out of 10. With the top four decided, Nondies will host the semifinals, most likely against Pirates. Whoever finishes second in the regular season between Falcons and Kisumu will host the second semi. Kisumu RFC secretary Jaycox Mwavali said: “We are definitely going to play Daystar irrespective of the outcome of this weekend’s result. We shall now battle for the hosting rights. We are like conjoined twins now.” Ahead, of their game against Western Bulls, Mwavali said: “We are going for a bonus point win against our neighbours Bulls in the Mashemeji derby and we hope Daystar loses to South Coast Pirates. We want to play a semifinal at home which will give us an advantage over Daystar.” Relegated Zetech Oaks host Kabarak University while University of Eldoret Trojans will play relegated Eldoret RFC.
