A lady on Wednesday demonstrated courage after breaking protocol at an event in Kiambu to ask CS Kithure Kindiki for a job. The CS was in the county for the official operationalisation of the new Cianda division in the Kiambaa Constituency. In a video shared on social media, the young had just addressed the function during which she informed the CS that she is the pursuit of a job opportunity. "I will hand over my papers to you. Thank you," she said as she walked towards him where they held a brief chat. The two are seen talking for a short while before leaving where the CS and other dignitaries had taken their seats. Her courage drew reactions among Kenyans with a section lauding her courage.
