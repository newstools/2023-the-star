Thika Queens' coach Fred Majani has warned his charges against complacency as they seek to topple Vihiga Queens in the race for this year's Women's Premier League. Thika are third on the WPL log with 18 points having raked in important wins lately including a 4-1  hammering of Vihiga who are the defending champions. On Sunday, the 2021 champions crushed minnows Kangemi Ladies 6-1 to record their third win on the trot. Majani challenged his worrisome attack to convert their chances and put the team in a steady position ahead of a grueling second leg. "My strikers need to develop the killer instinct and tack in the chances that come their way. We want to displace Gaspo from the second position before switching focus on leaders Vihiga who are the biggest threat to our title ambitions." Following the weekend results, Vihiga remain at the top of the table with 19 points—a point better than second-placed Gaspo with 18 points. Thika are third by virtue of an inferior goal difference while rejuvenated Nakuru City Queens are fourth with 17 points. Bunyore Starlets, who drew 2-2 with  Zetech Sparks, complete the top five places. Majani said they need maximum points against both Kayole and Sparks who are their next opponents. "There's no time to rest. We want to maintain our momentum and ensure we record maximum points in the upcoming fixtures," he said. "This is not the time to be complacent. We can only get better provided we secure maximum points in our next two fixtures," he added. Efforts to reach Gaspo's coach failed after the former head coach Ibrahim Mohamed told the Star he had parted ways with Gaspo FC. Gaspo face Wadadia this weekend before battling out with Vihiga Queens. .
