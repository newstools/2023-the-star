Azimio leader Raila Odinga has said threats of international sanctions will not deter his anti-government protests. While addressing a rally in Kitale on Sunday, Raila said he is not interested in travelling abroad and affirmed that his 14-day ultimatum to the government to lower the cost of living still stands. “I have heard them saying that Baba wants to bring chaos in the country, so I should not be allowed to travel abroad. I have no interest in going abroad,” he stated. The Opposition leader was quick to point out that Kenya does not have problems with other countries including its neighbours. “We are friends to European, America, Asia countries and even those in Africa. We are Kenyans and if we have problems, we have the responsibility of solving the issues ourselves. We do not want other countries to interfere with our internal affairs,” he stated. Raila maintained that other countries should respect the sovereignty of Kenya. “If there is dirt in the country, it is our responsibility to clean the mess. If there is electoral malpractice, it is our duty to correct it in accordance with our Constitution,” he affirmed. The former Prime Minister maintained that Ruto’s government is illegitimate and that his victory was snatched at the polls. “When you say that Raila should not go aboard, I'm not interested. Let it be. We will correct our problems in Kenya. I want to tell people not to be afraid.” Ruto’s allies have been calling for international sanctions on Raila should he continue with his anti-government rallies. Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei wants Raila’s privileges slashed for undermining the Kenya Kwanza regime. Nyaribari Chache MP Zaheer Jhanda said Raila and other Azimio leaders should return diplomatic passports or the government will have them recalled. “If they cannot respect the Government of the day and call for mass action, they will meet the full force of the law,” he said.
