Tanzanian singer Diamond Platnumz's has brought in a new showbiz 'babe' in his new music video, Zuwena. Zuwena is featured as his main video vixen. A few days after the song came out, Zuwena was emotional after she went viral for featuring in the singer's project. Recho Elias, alias Zuwena, broke into tears after meeting Diamond for the first time since the song came out. "You've made me get respect,"Â she said in the video shared on Wasafi's Instagram page. She was invited to Diamond's offices. Diamond further asked the stakeholders of the performing arts to give her a chance to showcase the great talent she has and be able to act in different characters. While giving flowers to Diamond, Zuwena prayed that the singer never lacks. "Indeed, God is great and I will trust him more and more in every breath I get," she said. "I have received a great reception in this, thanks to you my boss, Diamond Platnumz. May God continue to fight for you in your pursuit of life." The song tells a heartwarming tale about death, loss and grief. It is a story of a woman whose life takes a dark turn following the death of her spouse. Her brother-in-law is in a conversation with his late brother about the new woman 'Zuwena' has become, and all the hardships she has put them through. Zuwena was paid TSh17 million (about KSh900,000) by Diamond to be his video vixen.
