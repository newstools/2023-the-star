Ulinzi Sharks ripped Daystar University 55-12 in a Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) clash at Nyayo Stadium on Sunday. The emphatic win pushed the soldiers to 24 points, two above National Cereals and Produce Board. Leaders Nairobi Water Queens have 28. Hungry Sharks led 28-5 at the break as Sarah Wasike sunk 16 goals while Euphracia Mukasia and Sylvia Oguya managed eight each. The students, the only team without a win in the league, had six from Meldone Akoth and four from Edaliane Akinyi. Sharks, whose only loss is against champions Nairobi Water, had on the previous day dismissed Rising Star 60-12. Wasike dropped 13 points in that win. However, captain Diana Karani was not impressed, saying the team ‘lacked gas’ since it was their first match since the recent league break. Bungoma-based Rangers reaped big in their Nairobi visit, winning their two games on Sunday to go fourth on 20 points. They thrashed Nairobi City County (NCC) 41-19 after a 18-9 half-time lead. Naomi Musyoka scored 13 goals and Martha Lavenda added 12. Rangers also caged Net Navigators 32-28 as the on-form duo of Lavenda and Musyoka tallied nine and eight goals respectively. Sharon Akoth managed eight for the losers as Alexina Ambani and Abigail Wambua bagged six each. Navigators returned to torment Rising Star 40-19 in their other tie as Silvia Adhiambo scored 12 and Wambua nine. “We didn’t have a full squad since some of the players are unavailable. But we will keep pushing for a top-four finish,” said Ambani. Amazon torched winless Daystar University 40-20 behind 16 points from Christine Mwingi and nine from Voline Akoth. On Saturday, Rangers hit Amazon 41-26 and drew 35-35 against a determined Kenyatta University, who trailed 18-14 at half time. Navigators also hit Daystar University 40-12 and won 29-24 over Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) as NCC beat Daystar 31-28.
