Appointees of the Nairobi River Commission will be sworn in on Wednesday. Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Tuesday met with the appointees at Harambee House ahead of their inauguration. In a statement, Gachagua said the Nairobi River has been polluted to unspeakable levels over the years. "Earlier today, I held a consultative meeting with the Nairobi Rivers Commission led by chairperson Dr Pamela Olet, at Harambee House Annex, ahead of their inauguration tomorrow," Gachagua said. The DP said that it is time to rehabilitate the river and stop further pollution because it is hazardous to the entire ecosystem. President William Ruto in December 2022, appointed Pamela Olet to chair the Commission and placed it under the office of the Deputy President. Other appointees to the commission include Grace Senewa, Eva Muhia, Elizabeth Wathuti, Carlota Dal Lago, Elijah Biama, Ferdinand Waititu and Duncan Ojwang. However, the High Court suspended Waititu's appointment as a commissioner. Justice Hedwig Ong'undi said Waititu will not be sworn in until a case filed by the Law Society of Kenya and Transparency International is determined.
