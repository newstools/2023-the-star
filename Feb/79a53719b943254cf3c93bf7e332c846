Allan Oyende has cited Patrick Mutinda as his biggest challenger during the penultimate round of WESPAC and East, Central and Southern Africa Scrabble Championships (ECASA) on Sunday in Kitui. He said he was lucky to escape with a victory, describing the tourney as one of the most difficult ever. “I was very lucky to come out victorious. I faced a heavy challenge, especially from Mutinda, who has come out to be a very strong competitor in this journey. I know he is a good player and can make the cut to the USA show,” said Oyende. He said he ended the year well and has started perfectly. “I had a good run at the end of last year and I have started the year well. With only one qualifier remaining, my mission is to eliminate errors in my game ahead of WESPAC and ECASA,” said Oyende. On Sunday, Oyende produced an excellent performance to register three out of three wins in the ongoing Scrabble Kenya Grand Prix. Patrick Litunya managed the second position with 12 wins, losing six while Mutinda was third. The win at the two-day event at the Parkside Villa in Kitui guaranteed Oyende the top position with Scrabble Kenya set to pick the top six players for the WESPAC show in Las Vegas, USA in July after the final round. Oyende said at the moment, only a visa can stop his trip to the USA. “With one leg to go, I am guaranteed the top position after winning three out of five qualifying rounds as we head for the final round in Bondo next month,” he said. Oyende has now accumulated five points ahead of the final round after winning Nairobi, Standard Chartered, and Sunday’s Kitui legs. The Nairobi Stima Club member won 13 out of 18 games to be declared the victor, edging out Patrick Litunya who had won 12, losing six in the 18-match tournament.
