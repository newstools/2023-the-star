Kisumu Central Mp Joshua Oron has criticised and castigated the Kenya Kwanza Government for frustrating former President Uhuru Kenyatta. Oron said the current president should focus his energy on the needs of ordinary citizens. "The Kenya Kwanza administration should concentrate on the issues affecting Kenyans today and not these other political games they are getting into," he said. Speaking to journalists in Kisumu, the MP lamented that currently, the cost of living is very high with basic commodities prices increasing each and every day. The cost of water, he said, was high and has also been increased including that of power. "These are the things the administration needs to concentrate on so that Kenyans can live a comfortable and easy life but they cannot just wake up and make such drastic decisions," said the MP. He added, "When the cost of power is up, it means almost all items' prices will go up". The MP noted that they have not witnessed such frustrations being meted to former heads of state who had their full security details until they took their last breath. "Formers Presidents within this country never witnessed this when they left the office, why are they frustrating former President Uhuru", he questioned President Uhuru's Kenyatta security was scaled down on Thursday. The government defended their decision on this saying it was done by the law. The Inspector General of police Japhet Koome said the rationalisation of police officers guarding key dignitaries of the past regime was done in good faith. He also revealed that the security of the former first lady Margaret Kenyatta and retired Cabinet secretaries have also been scaled down since they are no longer on active duty.
