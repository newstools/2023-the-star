Residents in Nyamira have torched houses belonging to people suspected to be behind the raping and killing of a mentally-ill child. Nyamira township assistant chief Manyara Nyandiri said the body of PN, 14, was discovered in a tea plantation on Wednesday. In a police report, the deceased was found dead and half naked with blood oozing from her mouth. The report also indicates that there were no physical injuries. PN's body has been moved to the Nyamira County Referral Hospital. Investigations have started to establish the possible cause of death. Residents have called upon the police to intensify patrols at night to curb such incidents that are on the rise. “We are living in fear that is why we are urging our security teams to perform their duty, we do not want such incidents to happen again,” resident George Nyanumba said. Administrators in the area also called for calm. “We are calling upon the residents not to take the law into their hands or harm anybody as we get to know what transpired,” Nyandiri said.
