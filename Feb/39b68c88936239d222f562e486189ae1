Ivan Opakas will be banking on home advantage to shine at the Kenya Seed Golf series that tees off this Saturday at the Kakamega Golf club. Playing handicap 20, Opakas has been training at the club as he targets a  maiden career title. “I have been training well in preparation for the tournament. I have also been playing in some tournaments at the club. However, the tournaments have not been that big but they shape the swings in preparations for bigger tournaments like Kenya Seed series,” said Opakas. The provincial administrator will battle competition against golfers from Eldoret, Kitale, Kericho, Kisii, Nyanza regions. Traditionally, the event also attracts players from Uganda. “I want to win a first career title after playing golf for some time,” said Opakas.
