Azimio la Umoja coalition chief agent Saitabao Kanchory has waded into the alleged mysterious raid of the house of former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i. Speaking on Thursday, Kanchory said that some actions taken by the Kenya Kwanza government will overshadow the previous bad regimes. "The Ruto regime will make all the past bad regimes appear like angels," he said. The former CS said he had learnt of the planned raid earlier in the day. He defended himself from any wrongdoing saying he left the government a clean man. However, Inspector General of police Japhet Koome denied claims his officers went to Matiangí’s house. He said he had checked and found no such operation was sanctioned if any. Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission chief executive officer Twalib Mbarak also denied his officers were involved in the said attempted raid. On Thursday,  Matiang’i however moved to court seeking anticipatory bail. He argues that he is under imminent threat of arrest by the police and is justifiably apprehensive that his constitutional rights are being violated.
