The British government through high commissioner Jane Marriot has called for a dialogue between the investors and the Nandi County government to resolve the dispute over multinational tea farms and Karebe gold mines operated by British nationals. Marriot addressed the media on Thursday after meeting with Nandi governor Stephen Sang in Kapsabet. Marriot said she had visited a Kenyan tea company, adding that she was delighted by the relationship between the county and national governments and the tea companies. "I hope we will also find a way forward with the Karebe gold mine soon, the security and stability of the region and the people are very important to us," she said. Marriot acknowledged the misdeeds of British colonial rule and vowed a stronger relationship between the two countries will be formed. " UK and Kenya have a very long history together, shared history, some of it very positive, but some of it not positive, we have acknowledged and regretted that history, but we still have a little further to go," she said. She hoped, she said, that the two countries will work together in various sectors including agriculture, health and tourism which she noted benefit the citizens of both countries. The commissioner was in Nandi to launch a conflict resolution blueprint which is sponsored by the British government to assist the conflict-prone areas in the North Rift.
