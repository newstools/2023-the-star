Mr Seed's wife Nimo Gachuiri once dumped the singer but returned after things got tough. She shared a throwback video on their marriage anniversary, singing to Atemi's song, 'Baby.' In an Instagram story, she said, "Huko nje was bad!!! I called him and told him I wanted to see him and I missed him," she said. He just told me he loved me and gave me the keys to his new house. He told me he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. As I was singing, he took out his phone to record me and we made up!" Nimo's message comes a few days after her husband was alleged to be a deadbeat by a woman who claimed she has his child. Mr Seed has refused to comment about "family issues".
