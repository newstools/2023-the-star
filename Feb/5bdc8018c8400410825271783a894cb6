The Kisii derby between leaders Shabana and Gusii FC at Gusii Stadium will be the highlight of this weekend’s National Super League fixtures. Shabana lead the log with 25 points while Gusii are fourth with 18. Shabana coach Sammy Okoth played down the rivalry between the two teams, saying: “It’s just a game like any other. I don’t think it’s a big deal. We shall maintain our game plan as we go for maximum points.” Gusii coach, Kassim Junior, said: “Definitely. It will be a tough match. I’m looking forward to the game. I have known Sammy Okoth for many years, he is my mentor and a highly tactical coach.” He added: “Some of the Gusii players were at Shabana so these are people who know each other.” Both teams have lost one game each. In their last fixtures, Shabana lost 1-0 to Kibera Black Stars On February 8 while Gusii beat the Kibera side by the same scoreline at Gusii Stadium four days later. Meanwhile, Okoth mourned the death of their chairman Nyandoro Kambi. “It’s a big blow to the team. He was a generous man who used to support the team,” said the tactician. A minute of silence will be marked before the game in honour of Kambi, who collapsed and died in Kitengela last week.
