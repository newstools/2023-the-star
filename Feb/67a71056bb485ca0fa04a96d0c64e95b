Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) was awarded a total of Sh403 million in costs by courts from the 2013 and 2017 election petitions, documents tabled in Parliament reveal. The commission has, however, not recovered the funds several years later in what CEO Marjan Hussein argues is due to the extended process of executing the court orders. Speaking when he appeared before the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee, Marjan said the Commission was yet to obtain certificates from taxation officers to enable it to recoup the monies. “The commission must obtain necessary documents from the Court that includes certificates of costs and warrants of arrests and attachments…All these require funds and time,” he said. The documents show that 139 governors, MPs and senators owe IEBC the monies. Out of the Sh403 million, the total costs from the 2013 poll is Sh104 million while Sh299 million is for 2017 and emanated from High courts and lower courts. Among those owed the monies from their 2017 election cases are Julius Malombe who was slapped with Sh2 million after losing to Charity Ngilu, and Ochilo Ayako (Sh3.7 million) who failed to unseat Okoth Obado. Others are Farah Maalim (Sh3 million) who was trounced by the current Defence cabinet secretary Adan Duale in the Garissa Township seat and Lenny Kivuti (Sh4.5 million) after unsuccessfully challenging the election of Martin Wambora. Former CS John Munyes was to pay Sh2 million after losing it to Josphat Nanok in a case. Marjan, however, said they have already written to the various law firms to collect and remit to the commission the monies from the individuals.
