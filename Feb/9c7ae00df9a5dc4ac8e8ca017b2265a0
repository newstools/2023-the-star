Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has said that the Azimio la Umoja is a peaceful movement devoid of acts of lawlessness. While speaking in reference to their planned mass action, Karua said that all their supporters are peaceful individuals who only want the best for Kenya. "I want to tell those who oppose us that we are peaceful people. We shall continue doing what we are doing in a constitutional manner," she said. She was speaking on Sunday during an Azimio rally in Kitale, Trans Nzoia county. Karua was in the company of other Azimio leaders including the coalition's leader Raila Odinga. "This is our 12th meeting and all the meetings we have had have been peaceful," she said. "Even now, we have just come from the church with a huge crowd and they have walked along with us and we drove our cars slowly," she added. The former Cabinet Minister said that is what is called a peaceful procession. "In Kisii, we had procession of about five kilometers and in Nairobi we have had a peaceful procession from Gikomba to Kamukunji almost twice," she said. Karua reiterated that they are peaceful people but those who oppose them wish otherwise. "We know those who oppose us are dreaming of seeing chaos, putting people in our midst to cause chaos. We shall not allow chaos in our midst," Karua said. She said that instead, the Government should focus on giving Kenyans what they want. "They should just wait for us because if they don't do what Kenyans want, they shall go home," she said. The former presidential running-mate said that there are only a few days remaining for the Kenya Kwanza regime to act on what Kenyans want or face the power of the people through peaceful demonstrations. "We love our country and we don't want to hurt anybody but Kenyans must get what is rightfully theirs," she said.
