City lawyer Danstan Omari has said the law does not give President William Ruto any power to hand out development projects as he wishes. Omari, Monday, said the role is reserved for MPs. "The power to allocate development is with Parliament, not the President. It is budgeted. Any development agenda must be discussed in committees brought to Parliament," he said. He termed the move by MPs flocking the State House for development projects a critical mistake. "Show me anywhere the President has the power to give out development to any constituency?" Omari posed. He claimed Kenya is heading back to the dark days of muzzling the opposition by dishing out development projects selectively. "What I am trying to tell Kenyans is that there is no law that grants the President any power to dish out development," he said. He said MPs going to State House have failed to do the work in Parliament. Azimio chief Raila Odinga had also rubbished claims of MPs who went to see Ruto at State House on grounds of seeking development for their people. Raila said the MPs were hiding behind development while in a real sense, they were pursuing their individual interests.
