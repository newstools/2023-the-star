Kenya Cup defending champions Kabras have made four changes for this weekend's clash against Mwamba at the Impala Club. The unbeaten sugarmillers, who are second on the log with 34 points, will fancy their chances of getting a bonus point win and pile more misery on Mwamba. Head coach Carlos Katywa has recalled Teddy Akala to the front row to partner Hilary Mwanjilwa and Asman Mugerwa with Kenya Simbas' international Eugene Sifuna dropping to the bench. At halfback, Barry Robinson comes in for Dan Angwech with Alfred Orege moving to the wing in place of Paul Abuto as Bryceson Agesa starts in midfield with Matthew Osimbo dropping to the bench. Mwamba have had a torrid fortnight, losing 82-10 to leaders KCB and 53-15 to Menengai Oilers to see them drop to seventh on the log with 14 points. The side, known as Kulabun will rely on Eliakim Kichoi, Paul Opiyo and Mike Okello in the forwards with Michael Agevi, Joel Inzuga and Brian Kivasia the key actors in the backs. Mwamba coach Paul Kepha expects a response from his charges following the two consecutive losses. "It has been a tough two weeks but we are well prepared for this clash. We will be going for nothing short of a win," said Kepha. In other fixtures, Strathmore Leos have a date with Menengai Oilers at the Madaraka grounds. Louis Kisia's charges are 10th on the log and will be chasing the points as they seek move away from the relegation zone with three more fixtures on the cards. Playoff-chasing Kenya Harlequins make the short trip to the Rift Valley to face Nakuru RFC while KCB welcome Catholic Monks to the Lions' Den in Ruaraka. Homeboyz entertain winless Masinde Muliro University at Jamhuri Park while Mean Machine face Blak Blad in a varsity derby at the Kenyatta University grounds. The top four teams at the group phase will advance to the playoffs while the bottom two will drop to the championship.
