Simon Ndungu, 28, father to Nakuru quintuplets has said the initial ultrasound conducted on his wife showed only three babies. Speaking to the media, Ndungu said when he received the news, he was happy and thanked God for the blessings. "Nadhani hao wawili walijificha kwa tumbo. Kwa hao watano, kuna wasichana wanne na mvulana mmoja," he said. This is loosely translated to: I think the other two babies hid themselves during the ultrasound. Out of the five children, my wife has given birth to four girls and one boy. He is now appealing to well-wishers to help him with resources to raise the children. "I had not planned for the five babies, I'm appealing to well-wishers and the county government of Nakuru to help us," he said. Hospital's Medical Superintendent Aisha Maina said 25-year-old Margaret Wairimu presented herself at the facility on January 29. "She came in through the hospital's outpatient with discomfort and on checking her, the medics realised that she had multiple pregnancies," Maina said. She said the expectant mother was admitted for observation because she had a high-risk pregnancy. Maina said the pain exceeded, compelling the medics to do an emergency Caesarian Section to save the mother and babies. "The babies were delivered at six months and had to be incubated for survival," she said. Maina said the four girls and one boy weighed between 500 grams and 650 grams. The mother is in a stable condition and would be discharged once the infants attained the right body weight.
