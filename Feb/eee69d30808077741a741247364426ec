Former junior international sprinter Beatrice Anyango has resumed training after suffering a nasty boda boda accident in January. Anyango, who represented Kenya at the World Under-18 and World U-20 championships — both in Nairobi — suffered a knee injury and bruises in the accident as she headed to college in January. She is a plumbing student at Mawego Technical Training Institute in Homa Bay County. “The injury was terrible because I landed on my right knee. It was stitched but I am okay now. I have lost a lot in terms of training but I’m happy to be back on the track,” said Anyango. She represented her institute during the Kenya Association Technical Training Institutes Sports Association (KATTISO) Lake Region Athletics Championships at Gusii Stadium. She finished number two in the 100m, 200m. In 200m, Sharon Kwamboka of Keroka clinched gold in 26.68 with Anyango coming home second in 27.58. In 100m Lorna Ombati emerged winner in 12.51 with Anyango finishing second in 12.94. She also anchored her team to a second place finish in the 4x100m relay. “I’m happy that there was no reaction after the three events. I can now focus on the national KATTISO athletics championships and the last two Athletics Kenya track and field weekend meetings,” said the 21 year old. She said she decided to do a course in plumbing after failing to secure employment in the Kenya Prisons Service. “I was disappointed when they failed to recruit me alongside other athletes whom we were training with. I decided to do plumbing and pipe-fitting because athletics, especially sprints, is a short term career,” she told the Star.
