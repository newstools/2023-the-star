Former Roots party running mate Justina Wamae has said that anyone who wants Kenya back to manual voting should exit the political stage. She said such individuals should let younger people who are pro-technology take charge. "Technology is growing exponentially and anyone who wants to take us back to manual elections should leave the stage for younger ideas that are pro-technology," Wamae said in a tweet on Wednesday. "Our Judiciary stating that other countries are benchmarking on our election process is something to pride in." Her sentiments come after Opposition leader Raila Odinga during his keynote address at the 14th annual Leadership Conference and Awards in Abuja, Nigeria, said there was a need for African countries to rethink the use of technology in elections. In the event themed, "Credible Elections and Economy in Transition", Raila said there is a need for further reforms to make the voting process more accessible and reliable. "Existing election laws are not seen to assemble an electoral system that people believe is transparent. Some people have taken advantage of technology to subvert the will of the people," he said. "The voting machines should be able to generate voter records so that they can confirm that their choice is being recorded accurately or we go fully manual." Raila said before investors decide to finance particular countries, they look at the credibility of their elections.
