Doctors in Nairobi held protests on Monday over what they have termed as lack of a comprehensive medical insurance cover. The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union Nairobi branch secretary Malindi Chao said no doctor will be attending to patients as they try to seek an audience with Governor Johnson Sakaja. “KMPDU Nairobi branch informs the public that commencing Monday, all doctors working in Nairobi City County will be converging at the governor’s office due to lack of NHIF comprehensive insurance cover,” Chao said. Nairobi residents might be forced to seek healthcare services elsewhere if the doctors' concerns won't be addressed.
