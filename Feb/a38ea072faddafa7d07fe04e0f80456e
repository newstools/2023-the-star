ODM national chairman John Mbadi has for the first time come out to tell off his adversaries in the opposition party saying he is ready to leave the chairmanship position. The nominated MP said there is a clique of people who orchestrated his removal as the Minority Leader and are now hell-bent to push him out of the outfit’s leadership. Mbadi who has been at the helm of one of the oldest parties in the country for nine years said he is ready to let go of the position to his detractors. The seasoned legislator was responding to a sustained onslaught by a section of opposition leaders that he has been snubbing opposition rallies convened by Azimio's leader Raila Odinga. “Those who think being chairman is so important to them let them offer themselves to lead. I am very ready to leave the position to them, right now I am the chair but I am not dying to be the chair. I have done my bit they took away my position as the minority leader, I am still alive,” Mbadi said at parliament buildings on Tuesday. “They can still take away the chairmanship, but I will still be alive, I want to repeat it for the record, I want to leave this position for chair ODM.” Mbadi however maintained he will not ditch the Orange outfit and will remain loyal to Azimio boss Raila Odinga. The lawmaker said Azimio's boss is already aware of his intention to quit which is now a matter of time. He said he would have long resigned had the party had a vice chairperson to run the party in his absence. “I am not a person to run away from the office before we get good succession, I want to be succeeded, and still I will serve the party in whatever capacity, you know some people think being a chair is something I am dying for, far from the truth, I have done my bit.”
