Equity Bank has flagged as fake invitations for applicants who wish to benefit from the 2023 Wings to Fly education sponsorship programme. The purported invite was posted by a fake wings page on Facebook. "30 people with 300 marks needed kindly call 0768274788 or equitywingstofly@gmail.com," the fake ad read. It said interested applicants must have their ID cards, birth certificate, result slip and Form One calling later ready. "Anybody with issue unsolved kindly call 0412244800," the Facebook post added. But through its Twitter handle, Equity Bank dismissed the information as false. "Please note that this information circulating on various platforms is false. The 2023 Wings to Fly selection process for candidates who sat for the 2022 KCPE concluded with a commissioning ceremony of successful scholars on 21st January 2023," the bank said. The Wings to Fly programme is an initiative of the Equity Group and Mastercard Foundation (MCF). It was established to support secondary education for top-performing children in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exam but are financially challenged. The programme offers comprehensive support for beneficiaries through the provision of tuition fees, accommodation, books, uniforms, shopping, pocket money and transport to and from school during their four years of secondary education. Some 1,000 scholars were selected in the 2023 cohort.
