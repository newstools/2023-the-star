Diamond Platnumz’s manager Babu Tale has been awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of America. Tale said the Honorary Doctorate Degree in Philosophy was awarded to him for his contribution to leadership. "Today is a day that I cannot compare to any other," he wrote on Instagram. "I thank my country for maintaining a friendly environment that has enabled us to be recognised both locally and internationally." Babu Tale, who is also the Member of Parliament for the Morogoro South East constituency, further thanked his constituents for playing a major role in his successes. "Morogoro South East constituency, you have been a bridge to my success and I want to thank you for the honour I’m being given now and what will come my way in the future. May God bless you all and I promise to serve you more diligently," he said. In 2020, Babu Tale became the CCM’s flag bearer in the parliamentary seat after beating Tanzania’s Assistant Agricultural Minister Omary Mgumbe, who was the incumbent. He vowed to be a servant leader and live up the ideals of the office and deliver on the promises that they made together.
