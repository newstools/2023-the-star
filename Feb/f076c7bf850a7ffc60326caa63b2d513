President William Ruto has reaffirmed the government’s commitment to restoring sanity in the banditry-prone regions of the country. Ruto said the government will use all the available resources to ensure no lives are lost to the bandits who have continued to terrorize parts of the country, especially the North Rift. “Prof Kithure Kindiki is not here because he is in that region. Today he was in Baringo, yesterday he was in Turkana,” Ruto said. “I ordered him to leave his Nairobi office and pitch camp in the North Rift until the issue of Kenyans losing lives is resolved.” Ruto spoke in Nakuru on Sunday during a church service. On Saturday, leaders from the Rift Valley region called on Ruto to order the deployment of military officers to Kerio Valley and other banditry-prone parts of the country to restore normalcy. The four counties of Baringo, Turkana and Elgeyo Marakwet counties have been worst hit by the insecurity due to unending banditry and cattle rustling. This has left several people dead including police officers. Ruto said the government has put in place elaborate measures to ensure the bandits are dealt with once and for all. “Tutahakikisha wale watu wachache wajeuri wako pale wanajaribu kutuonyesha kiburi sisi tutapimana na wao na tutahakikisha hakuna Mkenya anapoteza maisha yake na tutahakikisha wakijaribu kuharibu usalama katika taifa letu la Kenya na sisi tutapambana na wao vilivyo,” This loosely translates to "we will ensure the few people who are trying to show us arrogance by destabilising the security of the country are firmly dealt with." Speaking at the same service, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago wants the police officers in bandit-prone Turkana facilitated with a chopper. Mandago decried the continued insecurity in the county. He said the choppers would enable the officer on duty to respond rapidly to any situations that may arise.
