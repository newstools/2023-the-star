Former Rugby patrons chairman Aggrey Chabeda will chair the Independent Electoral Board that will oversee the upcoming elections slated for March 24. The experienced rugby administrator will conduct the elections alongside Sadik Makii (Kenya Cup clubs representative), Auka Gecheo (Championship clubs representative), Faith Basiye (Women’s rugby representative) and sports lawyer Sarah Ochwada (KRU Board representative). Speaking during the unveiling of the board, KRU chairman Oduor Gangla said: “As a board, we are committed to ensuring we conduct the elections within the parameters that were given by the sports tribunal and adhering to the KRU constitution as well as the sports act.” The Sports Dispute Tribunal last week nullified the elections of directors held in September last year and called for fresh elections within 60 days. To that effect, the Union sent out an  notice on Tuesday that will see by-elections of the vice-chairman, treasurer, secretary and two directors followed by the election of the chairman and four directors. Makii, who is the KCB Rugby chairman and Gecheo, currently the Nondies chairman, will, however, relinquish their voting rights come the day of the election as per the ruling by the SDT. Gangla noted that the by elections for directors, whose elections were nullified by the SDT, will serve for a three-year term — until 2026 — while the chairman and directors will serve for a normal four-year term. Gangla was non-committal on whether he will defend his seat at the forthcoming polls. "I am consulting with the clubs…there is no further information as per now but we are consulting and will provide guidance at the right time. I think there are a lot of issues we have to deal with such that re-election is not the priority as per now,” Gangla said. "I think stabilising the game at this point in time is more important and we will also be unveiling programmes that the union will be doing this year, which I am quite excited about."
