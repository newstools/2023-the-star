Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, 77, has said he never misses to pack his ugandan food whenever he is travelling. In an undated video, Museveni said he packs milk, millet flour, fruits, chicken, honey and plantain bananas during his trips around the world. "When my pineapple stock ran out, I sent my staff to buy some from a store in while I was in the UK. I took one slice and terminated the whole exercise at ones," he narrated. Museveni said the pineapples he had were so hard, less sweet and had an ammonia-like pungent taste. "I have never seen or tasted a hard pineapple like the one I had in London," he added. "I couldn't believe that was a pineapple." Museveni firmly stated that he will not eat any pineapple until he goes back to Uganda.
