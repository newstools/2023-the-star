Uganda President Yoweri Museveni's son General Muhoozi Kainerugaba now claims he can win any elections in Kenya. In a statement on Twitter on Monday, Muhoozi said this is because Kenyans love him. Muhoozi said he still dreams of capturing Nairobi, adding that Kenya and its capital belong to him. "Even in my dreams Nairobi is mine. My old neighbourhood in Westlands will be my home. That city and country are mine! I can win any election in Kenya! The people love me," he tweeted. This is not the first time that the controversial general has talked about capturing Nairobi. In January, he asked whether Westlands was still up for sale. "Is Westlands still up for sale?" he asked He also claimed he could capture the city in a week. "Some Kenyans fear us because they know our military is greater than theirs. Our Army can capture Nairobi in 1 week!" he said. In October 2022, the General claimed that it would take him, and the Ugandan army less than two weeks to take control of Nairobi. In a series of tweets, Muhoozi made the statement in what many believed to be an apparent show of strength he and his army possess. "It wouldn't take us, my army and me, two weeks to capture Nairobi," he tweeted. Muhoozi later termed the remarks that had sparked public debate on Twitter as a joke. He said most people saw the joke in his words but others took it seriously. "Three months ago, I made a 'joke' about taking over Nairobi in two weeks. Now any Tom, Dick or Harry immediately saw it for what it was...'a joke'. But unfortunately for some, it was not. Either way, the truth shall win! The East African Federation shall be realised," he said on Thursday.
