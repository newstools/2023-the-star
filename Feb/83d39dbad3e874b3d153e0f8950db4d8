At least three people were killed at Kom-Durte gold mine in Isiolo North after it collapsed on Wednesday. Officials said some miners escaped. Governor Abdi Guyo said his administration was offering help to those affected. “We have been informed of the incident and are helping the best way we can,” he said. Isiolo county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding said Wednesday they had sent a chopper for a rescue mission. The scene is Merti town, 75 kilometres from Isiolo town. The area is also controversial and insecure as gangs usually fight for its control. Last year in August, four people were killed in a fight over control of a gold mine in the same area in Merti, Isiolo. Police said five others were injured in the clash between an armed gang and miners. Two of the victims were shot dead by the gunmen while two others were lynched by a mob in retaliation. Ravaging drought is pushing residents to venture into mining  for a living. In May last year, the government ordered an immediate ban on unlicensed mining activities in the Kom region of Merti subcounty. This was for, among other  measures, an environmental audit. Omoding said then the miners were using heavy machines to crush stones in their artisanal activities, overlooking the environmental impact. He directed those involved in the mining activities to stop operations as the National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) conducts an environmental impact assessment to give the ecological guidelines before mining operations can resume. The administrator said he had already directed Nema officials to carry out the environmental impact assessment and give a report as soon as possible. He added that the government would post an assistant county commissioner to the Kom area to reduce the distance the residents travel to seek government services at Merti town. At the same time Omoding directed gold miners to seek licenses from all the relevant government authorities before embarking on the work. (Edited by V. Graham)
