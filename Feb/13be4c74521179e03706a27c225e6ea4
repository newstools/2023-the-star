US-based Angela Okutoyi, Alicia Owegi and Rosehilda Asumwa are among players expected at the Women's World tennis tour slated for later this year at the Karen Country Club. Tennis Kenya secretary general Wanjiku Mbugua-Karani said: “As a federation, we have already contacted them and they have told us they are going to be available. We know their presence will be key as they look to inspire our younger girls in the sport.” Karani said  they  have not settled on the dates but will in due course. Prize money kitty for the event will be Sh3.2 million with the winner pocketing Sh360,000. She added that Kenya will be bidding to host Davis Cup Group Four tournament in either June or September. Kenya will be seeking to bounce back after getting relegated from Group 3 last year where they finished last after losing to Morocco, Namibia and hosts Algeria. The inexperienced team of brothers Kael Shah and Keean Shah, Derrick Ominde and Albert Njogu — coached by Francis Rogoi — will be given a chance to redeem themselves at this year's tournament. Kenya hosted the tournament in 2019 where they scaled to Group 3 alongside Namibia. Meanwhile, Karani said they have had fruitful discussions with Sports Permanent Secretary Jonathan Mueke in regard to the national tennis centre in Kasarani. “We had a positive engagement with him and we hope to fast track the construction of the courts as we seek to have at least two public courts as well as the ITF High-performance centre,” said Karani.
