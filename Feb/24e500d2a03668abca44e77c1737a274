Kathiani Member of Parliament Rober Mbui has called for the resignation of Nominated MP Sabina Chege as the Deputy Minority Whip. This is after Sabina Chege pledged to support and work with the Kenya Kwanza government. Speaking on Monday at a local TV station, Mbui said it was of no use for his counterpart to hold the position, noting that she will be no longer effective in representing the minority. "It's a no-brainer. Sabina Chege is the current deputy whip in the Azimio la Umoja coalition. So if she has gone to work with Kenya Kwanza how is she going to whip us?" he posed. The Kathiani MP further explained that Sabina Chege should resign from her position, saying that she could no longer whip members from the minority side of the house. "She needed to have just resigned from that office. We will just confirm whoever will continue with that work," he added. Sabina Chege is among the 32 Jubilee MPs who attended a meeting with President William Ruto and his Deputy Rigathi Gachagua last week at State House. The  Jubilee legislators pledged to work and support President Ruto's led government. "We don't want to feel left out in your government, so we kindly request you to include us in your development plans," said Chege. The leaders also attended Sunday's church service in Nakuru which was graced by President Ruto.
