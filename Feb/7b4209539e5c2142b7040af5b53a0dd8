Commonwealth Games 100m champion Ferdinand Omanyala wants to lower his 9.81 time recorded in the Athletics Kenya track and field event meeting at Nyayo last Saturday. Omanyala beat Samuel Imeta to second place in 9.94 seconds and South Africa's Henricho Brhintes to third in 10.22. Omanyala's latest record in the speciality is the world lead time. Speaking to the Star Omanyala said, "I am targeting 9.6 seconds and I believe it is achievable. This will be the second fastest all-time record." The current men's world record is 9.58 seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009. "I want to train even harder for the next month now that there is no competition. All preparations and targets should be geared towards the South Africa Grand Prix on April 12 and the World Championships in Budapest," Omanyala said. The World Athletics has set 10.00 seconds as the qualifying standard for the world event in Budapest. Omanyala also called on athletics faithful to fill the Moi Stadium Kasarani during the Kipkeino Classic set for May 13. "Kenyans should come in large numbers to cheer us at Kasarani. We won't let them down," he said.
