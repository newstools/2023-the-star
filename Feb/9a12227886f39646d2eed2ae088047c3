Kirinyaga Woman Representative Njeri Maina has condemned embattled Jubilee Party secretary general Jeremiah Kioni for attacking the current administration over the cost of living. Maina said Kioni has no moral authority to lecture the Kenya kwanza government because President William Ruto inherited a dilapidated economy from the previous regime. The Woman Rep was speaking during a food distribution exercise in Gichugu on Saturday. The beneficiaries received rice and beans rations from the county MP. She said the new administration has a marshal plan to revive the economy and push down the cost of living. Her sentiments come days after a group of protesters expressed their outrage over high food prices. Maina lauded President Ruto’s administration for initiating sustainable programmes to mitigate climate change whose brunt has been felt in a number of sectors, top among them food production. She highlighted among others, the tree-growing campaign geared toward restoring and improving the country’s forest cover to attract rain and improve agriculture-related activities. Maina, however, lamented how Kirinyaga, the country’s food basket is on the list of counties worse hit by the ongoing famine. “We will continue supporting the President's long-term initiatives to solve famine and other crippling effects brought about by climate change. I urge all of you to join him in the course of restoring nature," Maina said. She said that Parliament will soon begin debating Ruto’s first supplementary budget and so Kenyans should exercise patience. Maina assured Kenyans that the Kenya Kwanza administration has a listening ear and will continue factoring the needs of Kenyans into its budget. Residents urged the government to devise ways to have the Thiba dam supply them with water for irrigation saying the dam has not been effectively utilised to benefit them despite being physically located within the constituency.
