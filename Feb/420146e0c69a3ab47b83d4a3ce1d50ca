Chief Justice Martha Koome has said the judiciary intends to introduce courts to deal with petty sessions in major urban areas. "We intend to establish Courts of Petty Sessions in major urban areas to ease congestion in the criminal justice sector," she said. She said the petty sessions courts will also operationalise instant traffic fines and support family rehabilitation programmes. The Chief Justice spoke during a roundtable meeting with development partners. The meeting was held to align priorities under the Social Transformation through Access to Justice vision with strategic partner programmes. Koome said they aim to identify and pursue informed, aligned, consolidated and enhanced project-specific partnerships under a Judiciary Partner Engagement Framework. She said the key priorities under STAJ include ensuring justice for the poor, marginalised and vulnerable. "Notably, we aim to create a safe justice system that is child-friendly," she said. The Chief Justice said the judiciary aims to have 100 fully established Small Claims Courts within the next five years. This, she said, will support the country’s quest for economic development. "We are focused on improving physical access and proximity to justice resources including legal information to ensure those who have been excluded can have justice within their reach," she said. Koome said the judiciary is committed to establishing a justice system that responds to the principles of environmental sustainability, grassroots empowerment, participatory democracy and social justice.
