Fuel prices will remain unchanged for the fourth month in a row since November 15 ,2022 according to the latest review by the energy regulator, EPRA. The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) said on Monday the price of Super Petrol will remain at Sh177.30, Diesel at Sh162 while Kerosene retail at Sh145.94 per litre. "In accordance with Section 101(y) of the Petroleum Act 2019 and Legal Notice No.192 of 2022, EPRA has calculated the maximum retail prices of petroleum products which will be in force from February 15,2023 to March 14,2023," the statement reads in part. "In the period under review, the maximum allowed petroleum pump prices for Super Petrol, Diesel and Kerosene remain unchanged." EPRA said the prices are inclusive of the 8 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2018, the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2020 and the revised rates for excise duty adjusted for inflation as per Legal Notice No. 194 of 2020. "The price of diesel has been cross-subsidized with that of super petrol, while a subsidy of Sh19.41 per litre has been maintained for kerosene in order to cushion consumers from the otherwise high prices," EPRA said. It added that the government will utilise the Petroleum Development Levy to compensate oil marketing for the difference in cost.
