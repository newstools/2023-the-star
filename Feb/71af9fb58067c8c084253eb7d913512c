Kenyan record champions, Gor Mahia, have set the stage for a record-breaking 20th Kenyan Premier League title after posting a stellar run of performances in their fixtures thus far. Their season got off to a slow start, but perseverance and consistency allowed them to build the momentum they needed to set their title hunt in motion. A spirited 2-1 victory over Kenya Police at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Saturday in a thrilling "Sirkal" derby, saw K'Ogalo assume complete control of the top-flight proceedings, effectively opening a four-point buffer at the summit. Gor has accumulated 37 points from 11 victories, four draws, and one loss in 16 league games thus far. KCB and Nzoia Sugar are tied on 33 points but a superior goal difference places the bankers second. Gor, arguably Kenya's most successful club, won the KPL championship in 1968, 1974, 1976, 1979, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2018-19 and 2019-20. Other than the KPL title, they also bagged the FKF President's Cup a record 11 times. Gor last won silverware three years ago ago. The only way they can appease their dotting fans is by wrapping up the season at the apex of the log. With the caliber of their talented roster that boasts plenty of depth, K'Ogalo may end up winning more awards this season. All eyes are on Benson Omalla, Gor's gifted striker, who has enjoyed a bountiful harvest this season thus far after netting 16 goals. The Kisumu Day alumnus who has been on a roll, gave their ardent fans a special Valentine's gift last Tuesday. He scored a hat trick to propel the record champions past a hapless Wazito side at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. He capped his splendid run and boosted his chances of winning this year's Golden Boot gong after grabbing a late winner for his side in their 2-1 triumph over Kenya Police at the same venue. Gor Mahia head coach Jonathan McKinstry has instructed his men to keep their sights firmly set on the title . He also warned them to be mindful of any distraction that could derail their ambitions. "I'm urging the boys not to relax, neither should they let our good run get to their heads. It's time to step on the gas pedal and keep the momentum going," McKinstry said. "We are not going to relent on our title ambitions. We are now in a strategic position to maintain our stay at the summit of the table and seal the season.
