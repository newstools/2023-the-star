Jeremiah Wahome bagged his first-ever Kenya National Rally Championship win after taking the honours at the Rallye Sports Club (RSC) Machakos Rally Wahome beat McRae Kimathi to second while Jasmeet Chana rounded off the podium places. Navigated by Victor Okundi in a Ford Fiesta Rally 3, Wahome won by 07.7 seconds to take an early lead on the Kenya National Rally Championship log. It was a result of historical significance as Wahome, who finished fourth overall in the 2022 African Rally Championship standings, became new leader in the nine-leg series. It was a historic feat for Kimathi, who bagged the best career finish on the circuit . Kimathi also won the Power Stage, which was a repeat run of the 15.08km Phinny Stage, where the top three drivers earned bonus points. Wahome, who has competed in various open-wheel formulae, including the BRDC British Formula 3 Championship and F3 Asian Championship, ran second fastest on the power stage while Ugandan Yasin Nasser chalked up third fastest. Nasser finished fourth overall, falling in his quest for a first career win on Kenya soil. He was aiming to become the second Ugandan to win the event since the late Riyaz Kurji and Syed Kadri claimed victory in a Subaru Impreza in 2006. Nasser ran the Machakos event behind the wheel of his new Ford Fiesta, which he had only tested in an autocross championship back home. Kimathi and Wahome are steering the M-Sport Poland Ford Fiesta R3 and are eligible to score points in the newly introduced KNRC Rally3 Championship. Aakif Virani, in a Skoda Fabia Rally 2, was one of the early pacesetters prior to his exit in the fourth stage (the initial run on the Phinny stage). Virani, who made a comeback after sitting out of the second half of the 2021 season, set the fastest time on CS1 Machakos People's Park stage. The event was flagged off from Machakos People’s Park where the organisers, RSC, ran a 6.45km Super Special before running the rest of the event at Lisa Farm. The championship heads to Voi on the weekend of March 18-19.
