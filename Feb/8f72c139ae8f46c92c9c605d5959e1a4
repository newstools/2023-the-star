The Directorate of Criminal Investigation volleyball team clinched a commanding 3-0 win against Nairobi Water in the first match of the Kenya Volleyball Federation women's league at the Nyayo stadium on Saturday. The sleuths won in straight sets of 25-21, 25-18 and 25-17 to mark a dream start to the 2023 season. DCI, coached by Daniel Bor, dominated the tie from the start with reception, defence and attack functioning properly. Bor said: "We played well according to instructions. The win gives us the impetus to tackle the Kenya Pipeline match tomorrow with the right mentality." "We expected a lot of resistance from our opponents but that never happened. The match turned out to be one-sided but all in all, it was the perfect start we deserve." Nairobi Water captain Ruth Chelangat observed that the team is in the right direction despite the setback. The league returnees who last featured in the league in 2017 take on Kenya Prisons tomorrow. "We have shown that we can compete in this cut-throat league. We take valuable lessons from the defeat, rectify our mistakes and be ready for the do-or-die fixture with the Wardresses on Sunday."
