Senate majority leader Aaron Cheruiyot has dismissed Raila Odinga's latest demands terming them as a plot to seek yet another Handshake, with President William Ruto. Cheruiyot said the former Prime Minister is threatening to use violence to box the current regime into a corner to force a political deal. "After eating Kenya to the ground under the evil handshake regime, Tinga wants to force another munching round by use of threats to violence. There are no more cowards in town," he said. The Kericho senator called on President William Ruto to focus on delivering on his mandate, which is repairing the economy. "I urge the President to focus on repairing the economy badly ravaged by the handshake looting spree." Senator Cheruiyot was reacting to demands made by Raila on Wednesday at the Jeevanjee gardens. The Azimio leader gave the government a 14-day mass action ultimatum if Jeevanjee's demands are not met. Raila demanded that President William Ruto's government lowers the price of basic commodities and taxes, in 14 days. He said failure to do so, the Opposition will stage anti-government demonstrations. "Withdrawal of subsidies to food and education in the middle of drought and famine was reckless and heartless. Consequently, the subsidies must be restored, and the cost of basic commodities and taxes must come down in the next 14 days," Raila said. The ODM leader also called for the opening of the IEBC server and an audit conducted using a reputable firm. He said the ongoing process of reconstituting IEBC must also stop immediately and a bipartisan team put in place to restructure the electoral body in a manner that ends its monolithic operations. "If these demands are not heeded within 14 days we shall lead Kenyans into mass action across the country to have their power back and restore their country," Raila said.
