Over 52 bright and needy students in Kisumu county benefitted from half a million bursary courtesy of Senator Tom Ojienda. The students from the seven sub-counties within the county accompanied by their parents could not hide their joy as they received the checks at the senator's office in Kisumu. According to the Manager Simon Peter, this is just the beginning and they will continue to help the bright and needy students when the need arises. "We will not send away any parent who is in need of assistance when it comes to education, the office will assist in one way or another," he said. Peter added that the students who have benefited will both join the form one day and boarding schools. "I call it a privilege because many don't link the office to education and going by our slogan of development and rights, the professor thought it right to consider this very aspect from his pockets." This, he said, was the first Phase adding that there is a special category for the full scholarship. "We are going to call the parents this week where the respective beneficiary will receive the cheques from school uniforms, education materials to full fees. This is a full scholarship ". A beneficiary parent Rose Osir from Kisumu West Constituency said life had pushed him to the wall and dint know how her child was going to join form one. "I came to the office early last week to share my problems. I was literally in tears when I told them that I could not take my child to school, am happy that today I was called to pick up the cheque," she said.
