The Global Fund team on Wednesday met with the ministry of health officials to discuss the future of Universal health coverageÂ (UHC) among other issues in the health sector. Global Fund Country manager Paul Mac Carrick and the PS Medical Services Peter Tum sought to discuss key initiatives for enhancing the UHC agenda in the country. The delegation discussed topics such as ineligible expenditure, the need for lower prices from KEMSA, the role of the private sector and NHIF. They also discussed the allocation of more than Sh49 billion for fighting HIV, malaria, and TB. "The goal of the meeting was to work together towards a healthier Kenya with universal health coverage," Tum said. In September, Kenya pledged to give close to Sh1 billion to the Global Fund. The fund finances the treatment of HIV, malaria and TB in developing countries. The Global Fund aims to raise Sh18 billion (Sh2.16 trillion) for 2023-25. Kenya is both a donor and an implementer of Global Fund-supported programmes. That means its donations are largely symbolic because the money does not leave the country but is simply invested in local programmes supported by the Global Fund. The principal recipients of Global Fund grants are the National Treasury, Kenya Red Cross Society and Amref Health Africa.
