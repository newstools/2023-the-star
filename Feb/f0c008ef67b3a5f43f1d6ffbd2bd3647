Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo has said that the IEBC would have come out to deny the ‘whistleblower report’ if it was false. Speaking on Tuesday, the legislator said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission had a chance to discredit the information if it was not true. "The IEBC has never come to disown the whistleblower report, they haven't because if it was false they would say this is false but they haven't," he said. He said that the report of the whistleblower came while former chairperson Wafula Chebukati and his team were still in office. Chebukati and commissioners Molu Boya and Abdi Guliye's terms ended and President William Ruto has already gazetted their positions vacant. In January, Azimio leader Raila Odinga claimed the opposition had the official presidential results. They claimed that a whistleblower who works for the IEBC provided them with evidence that Raila won the election with about 2.2 million votes but was rigged out. The dossier claimed Raila garnered 8,170,355 votes or 57.53 per cent of votes cast against Ruto's 5,915,973 votes (41.66 per cent of votes cast). Raila has on many occasions maintained that he won the August 9, presidential poll. The opposition boss has held a series of anti-government rallies calling for Ruto's resignation.
