Business in Naivasha town was temporarily paralysed after two groups clashed over the control of a public toilet. During the incident at the Kinangop bus terminus, some of the youths were injured and others arrested as the facility was closed down. The control of the toilet that is used at a fee ofSh10 by residents has attracted the interest of various lenders over the cash collected every day. Viwandani MCA Mwangi Muraya who led one of the groups alleged that the term for the current group had expired and that they should move out. He said that the new group had all the required documents issued by the county adding, that some matatu operators had interest in the facility. “This toilet is meant to benefit the area youths but some matatu leaders want to take advantage of the situation and we shall not allow this,” he said. But the leader of the warring group Andrew Opiyo lashed out at the MCA for using his position to "oppress" them. He denied that they had the support of some matatu leaders adding they had a three-year contract with the county government to run the toilet. “We have a court order empowering us to run this toilet until the pending dispute is heard and determined and the MCA should respect that,” he said. This was echoed by his treasurer Rahab Wanja who said that they would obey the court order once the issue was heard and determined. Wanja denounced at the warring group, saying they did not have any legal documents, as they were alleging. “The MCA whom we voted into office the other day is trying to use his position to oppress us and we are ready to go back to court,” he said. The Naivasha Matatu Sacco chairman Stephen Mungai however denied that they were supporting one of the groups in the control of the toilet. “We don’t have any interest in the control of this toilet but we are asking the county askaris to stop harassing these youths through arrests and to respect court orders,” he said.
