It was Shakespeare who said, "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet". In other words, the attractiveness of a rose does not depend on what you call it. Similarly, are we exaggerating the difference between the colours of police uniforms? In 2019, the general police started wearing a bright blue uniform which was not popular. During the election campaign, the UDA promised to consider changing the colour. Now, the style of the uniform is under consideration by ex-Chief Justice David Maraga along with over 20 more fundamental issues facing the police. The government seems to have decided already that there should be a lighter blue uniform, even though Maraga is yet to report. But the government is in a cash-flow crisis and the police have more important issues that need to be resolved – better housing and safer armoured vehicles to name but two. Is this the right time to be buying at least two new uniforms for 35,000 police men and women? Don't the police have higher priorities? Let's postpone ordering new uniforms for the police until Maraga has reported and until we have provided for their more urgent immediate demands.
