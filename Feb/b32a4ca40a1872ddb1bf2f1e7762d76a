Girls in the Kajiado North subcounty received an alternative rite of passage in a bid to stem the practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in the region. The alternative rite of passage was organised by AMREF in collaboration with various Community-Based Organisations (CBO) in the region. A Pack A Month, a CBO in Kajiado North, took part in the celebrations, as the country joins the world in commemorating International Day for Zero Tolerance of FGM. Jackline Saleiyan, the founder of A Pack A Month, said that the alternative rite of passage envisions a continent free of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C). "We want a continent where girls are empowered to continue their education and become the women of their dreams," she said. She said the Alternative Rite of Passage (ARP) is an innovative community-driven approach to eliminate FGM. "The community is encouraged to celebrate the transition of the girl to adolescent through the impartation of education and wisdom in place of the cut," she said. The graduands took part in the three-day camp, learning about Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHRs), Life Skills, effects of FGM, Early ChildÂ  Forced Marriage, teenage Pregnancy, cultural norms, and the value of the girl child's education. Saleiyan said their organisation, which works to end period poverty in their area, celebrated the Amref graduates by supporting them with sanitary towels and Menstrual Health Management talks.
