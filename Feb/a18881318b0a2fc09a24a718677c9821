Former Jubilee Secretary Raphel Tuju has announced that former Education CS George Magoha‘s funeral service will be politics-free. Speaking during the requiem mass at Consolata Shrine on Friday, he said that the family had requested a politics-free service. “The family has decided and requested most politely that on this occasion we keep the service dignified and that there will be no politics in our encounter,” Tuju said. “Please bear with us as a family because it has been extremely difficult.” Tuju explained that the family had been through a lot the past year and politics was not welcomed at the service. “In 2021 we buried one of the brothers of  Magoha. It was a twin funeral,” he said. Magoha's brother Alex Nyabera Magoha passed on in Allen, Texas in the US on December 6, 2022. The cause of his death was however not made public. In August 2021, the CS lost his other brother, Charles Agunga Magoha who died in Sweden. Recounting his last moment with his cousin before he died, Tuju said that Magoha talked about death and said that they should be ready to die anytime. “On the day before Magoha died I was in  house, we were discussing with the professor about the funeral plans of his brother. He said that we should be ready because our time can come at anytime. A day later he passed on,” he said. Magoha’s died on January 24, 2023, after suffering a cardiac arrest. The former SG said that Magoha was prepared to receive his brother’s body at JKIA that Tuesday, only for him to die. “He was to go to JKIA  to receive his brother’s body only for it to arrive in the same mortuary that Magoha was," Tuju said.
