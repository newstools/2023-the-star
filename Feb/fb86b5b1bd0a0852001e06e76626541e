Kenya Rugby Union will appoint a new Simbas' coach early next month, chairman Odour Gangla has revealed. Gangla did not divulge if the coach will be a foreigner or local but insisted the new tactician will be in place by the time the Simbas begin their campaign in the Currie Cup first division in April. “By early next week, heading into March, we will have a new coach as we look at playing in the Currie Cup from April,” added Gangla. Former coach Paul Odera resigned after a three-year stint at the helm following the conclusion of the World Cup repechage where Kenya finished last after losing 68-14 to USA , 85-0 to Portugal and 22-18 to Hong Kong in Dubai. Team Kenya had finished second in the African qualifiers played in France, losing 38-0 to Namibia in the final in July last year. Gangla said extensive reviews have been done on the team following their failure to qualify for this year's Rugby World Cup. “We did our reviews late last year and early this year and those findings will be given to the new coach to rectify as we look at the next World Cup cycle,” added Gangla. The Simbas will be playing in the Currie Cup for the second year running after finishing eighth last year after winning just three of their nine matches. Meanwhile, plans are underway to play some of the Currie Cup matches at the RFUEA grounds.
