A viral video in which teachers of a school in Kisii are heard urging pupils to imitate a sex scene has led to the arrest of six suspects. The video had been trending on local social media platforms since Monday causing a huge uproar. Police said they traced the footage to the Itumbe DOK primate in Nyamache, Bobasi constituency. Detectives stormed the school Wednesday afternoon and conducted the arrests. The suspects were cited as Everline Moraa, Gladys Kenyanya, Angelica Joseph and Moraa Nyairo. Others are Catherine Moraa and William Isoka Sub-county police boss Kipkemoi Kipkulei who confirmed the arrests to the Star by phone said he is already consulting with education officials before charges are preferred on the suspects. The teachers' phones were also confiscated for forensic tests, he said. The 29-second video sparked huge traffic online with Kenyans asking if it was the application part of the new Competence Based Curriculum syllabus. The class of the learners has not been disclosed yet due to the sensitivity of covering children in sex-related scenes. Kipkemboi said he himself was stunned by the depictions in the suggestive videos. Locals said they were appalled by the enormity of the suggestive video. "So many had been coming to my inbox asking if what the children were being forced to do was new syllabus content," said John Ombasa a Kisii resident. Two boys are seen mounting their two fellow pupils in an indecent pattern to the laughter from the teachers. One female teacher is heard telling them to show how sex is done What sparked more fury from the public was the tone of a harsh female teacher threatening to cane them if they chicken out.
