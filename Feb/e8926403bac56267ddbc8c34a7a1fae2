Kiambu Senator Karungo Thang'wa has chided the Jubilee party for relocating from the Pangani to a 'one-bedroom house' in Kileleshwa. The Kenya Kwanza politician suggested that President William Ruto should allow UDA to occupy the Pangani-based Jubilee House. He said the move will end Jubilee's longstanding contempt, chest-thumping and disrespect to the United Democratic Alliance. “In the spirit of Kumaliza Madharau na Kiburi, I think we the UDA Party should move our headquarters to Pangani, now that Jubilee Party has moved their Hq to a '1-bedroom' house in Kileleshwa,” Thang'wa said. The politician was referring to Jubilee's decision to move its headquarters from a multi-storey complex at Pangani to Kileleshwa. The former ruling party, to which Ruto served as deputy leader, is facing a tough time following the rise of UDA. The current headquarters of UDA is located at the Hustler Centre, Makindi Road, Off Riara road. In a statement on Wednesday, Jubilee Secretary General Jeremiah Kioni did not disclose the reason why the former ruling party moved. "The Jubilee party headquarters has been relocated to a new address within the Kileleshwa area, off Mandera Road," Kioni said. "Our focus will be on strengthening our county, constituency and ward offices and recruiting more members as we mould and nurture the next generation of Jubilee leaders." In 2018, the then Jubilee party deputy secretary Caleb Kositany claimed the party was paying about Sh90 million in annual rent for the seven-storey building.
