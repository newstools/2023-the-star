Mawingu, a Kenyan-based internet service provider is targeting counties in its expansion drive after netting $9 million (Sh1.23 billion) in funding. The firm currently operates in more than 15 counties in Kenya with a customer base of 7,500. It plans to double its customer base to 14,000. "Our strategy is to stay rural in counties like Wajir, Marsabit and Voi. This is driven by demand for cheap and quality internet,'' Mawingu CEO  Farouk Ramj said in a statement. He said the firm's goal is to be in 40 counties and also ensure that rural Kenyans have a last mile internet connectivity Mawingu's expansion plan is pilling pressure on market leaders in the country as the internet becomes a necessity. Latest data from the Communications Authority (CA) shows that Safaricom is commanding a market share of 35.6 per cent followed by Zuku-owned Wananchi at 25.5 per cent. Jamii Telecommunications comes in third with 18.9 per cent, followed by Poa Internet (9.1 per cent). Internet providers in the country are heavily investing in their expansion drive to connect homes due to increased demand from Internet learning, working from home, and online streaming services such as Netflix. While big boys are leveraging their infrastructure to connect more customers, Mawingu is countering them on price, selling 10mbps for less than Sh2,000 compared to Sh2,900 and Sh3,000 charged by Zuku and Safaricom per month respectively.
