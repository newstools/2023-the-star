As Kenya continues to struggle with employment, some people are earning huge sums from agribusiness. The lucrative sector has made several people quit their jobs for agribusiness in remote areas. Among those who transitioned is Odera Wayayi. He says farming pays more than those who rely on a monthly salary that is heavily taxed. While in Siaya as a public health officer, Wayayi started keeping chicken just for family consumption and had not thought of doing it on a large scale. With time, he found it was not costing him much to rear the chicken, so he allowed the production to boom. "While still in Siaya, I started doing traditional vegetables just for family and not for the market," he said. After doing well in chicken farming, Wayayi decided to expand the variety of birds he keeps, which earned him well. Mzee Augustine Onyango moved from his job of masonry and carpentry to poultry farming, from which he earns thousands of shillings from the comfort of his house. “I earn good money while in my house from eggs and birds, and most of the time, I do selling of chicks between one day and one month old,” he said. “Those chicks at one day to a week, each goes for Sh100. Two weeks to one month, I sell it at Sh250. Then one month and above, Sh500. A well-grown hen goes for Sh800 and cockerel for Sh1,000.” Rodrick Oware is another man whose luck came from selling trees and running the hotel industry as well. Before starting it, the poverty he was experiencing made most people around him avoid him. “In villages, people want to engage you when you have cash so you can spend time at drinking points and smoking,” Oware said. "But when you don’t have money, you have no business at all being with them." Now he creates employment for people in his locality, the same​​ as Wayayi and Onyango.
