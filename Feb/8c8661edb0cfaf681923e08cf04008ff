Opposition leader Raila Odinga has blamed Kisii clashes between Pro-Azimio and Pro-UDA youths on the state. In a statement on Saturday, the ODM leader condemned the attack as he accused the state of working with people he termed as 'known criminals'. He insisted that youths who attended Friday's anti-government at the Gusii Stadium were victims of the attack. "That the attackers were led by a well-known jailbird and hardcore criminal with several warrants of arrest to his name, is an indication that we are back to rule by thuggery and hooliganism," Raila said. "The victims in this attack were youth who attended the very peaceful Azimio rally in Kisii on Friday." The former Prime Minister said action must be taken against the said individuals. He added that anyone who has an issue with the Azimio rallies should face them instead of their supporters. "We will not allow state sponsored-hooliganism to take root in Kenya again and we will neither be cowed nor intimidated." This comes after at least four youths were injured in the morning melee in Kisii. The skirmishes broke out near Ram Hospital along Daraja Moja-Nyamataro bypass after several youths who had filtered out of Kisii County Assembly engaged the UDA youth with stones. A police officer in riot gear also suffered slight injuries on the back after he was pelted with a stone.
