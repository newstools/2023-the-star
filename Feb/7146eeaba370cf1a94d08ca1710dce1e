World under-20 race walking champion Erickson Wanyonyi, fresh from Kenya Police Training College in Kiganjo made his intentions to represent Kenya at the African Games and World Championship clear after dominating his specialty. “I’m happy to have emerged winner on my return to the track. I’m now done with police training because it was not easy to balance athletics and college. I will now turn focus on training for the Africa Games and World Championships. I also hope to represent Kenya at next year’s Olympic Games in Paris,” he added. The General Service Unit officer spoke at Moi Stadium, Kisumu after beating former World Under 18 bronze medallist, Dominic Ndigiti to second place and Stephen Ndangili to third place. Wanyonyi clocked 43:32.6 while Ndigiti finished in 43:47.9. Ndangili clocked 43:48.2. “I am now focusing on speed work and endurance in training as I seek to attain a qualifying mark in the 20km race ahead of World Championships and Olympics,” Wanyonyi concluded. On his part, Ndigiti decried the lack of training facilities in his Nyamira backyard. “We don’t have a proper track in Nyamira which forces me to travel all the way to Kisii for training. Despite those challenges, I’m working hard and looking forward to a fruitful season,” added Ndigiti. National 100m record holder Maximilla Imali dominated the 100m and 200m races, winning both events. She also anchored her team to victory in the women’s 4x400 relay. “From the first two events in Mumias and Kisumu, I'm happy with my performance though I’m not where I want to be. I’m working on my endurance,” she said. Imali added: “As I said earlier, my target is the World Championships this year and maybe the Olympics next year.” She won the 200m in 23.9,  beating Mercy Chebet (24.5) to second place while Eunice Kadogo (24.8) was third. In 100m, she won in 11.5 while second-placed Mercy Chebet clocked 11.7. Esther Mbagari was third in 11.8. Moses Wasike dominated the 100m and 200m races in the men's category.
