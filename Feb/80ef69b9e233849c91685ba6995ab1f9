Netflix Kenya has reduced their prices and released the slate of upcoming shows. The streaming site, which charges users based on packages subscribed to, revealed that popular reality show 'Young, Famous & African' will be getting a season 2. In a statement, Netflix said subscribers can now watch content on the streaming platform starting from Sh200. Basic will cost Sh300, Standard Sh700, and Premium Sh1,100. "Our goal is to offer a wide variety of quality shows and films, curated for all Kenyans. So whatever your mood or tastes, you can find something right to watch," the statement reads. It adds that new members who sign up will see the new price for the plans immediately. The update will also roll out to existing members over the coming weeks from their next billing cycle. Existing members will be notified by email, [as well as within the Netflix app 30 days before the new prices are applied to them (this is only for auto-upgrades)]. The exact timing will depend on the specific member’s billing cycle. Netflix has been investing heavily in great new shows and films over the last few years. Upcoming TV and film slate include 'Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story', 'Luther: The Fallen Sun', 'Murder Mystery 2', 'Extraction 2' as well as recently launched titles like 'Glass Onion: Knives Out', 'Wednesday', 'Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical'.
