In partnership with the National Government, Nairobi County will launch its Green Nairobi project next month. President William Ruto on Friday announced that the project will be purely youth-driven, where the youths will be employed. "Youths who were previously employed under the Kazi Mtaani project will be absorbed into the Greening project,” he said. The Head of state announced that the project which will kick off on March 1, 2023, aims to plant over 11 million trees in five years. As a result, the project will engage more than 10,000 youths in Nairobi and will be co-funded between the national government and Nairobi City County Government in what will be dubbed as " Jeshi ya Mazingira”. The President said that embracing the tree-planting initiative will not only create employment but also save the country from climate change. Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja had earlier said that a tree-planting programme will not only lead to creating job opportunities for young people but also keep the youth away from crime. The programme, with the help of the Kenya Forest Services (KFS) and the National Government, will have the young employees work for four days a week and earn Sh,2,400 a week. Marking his 38th birthday on Thursday, Sakaja planted 38 trees at Central Park which was part of 3600 planted that day across the capital. His boss, President Ruto, also planted trees on his birthday last year. His plan is to plant 15 billion trees by 2032. He planted 56 trees to mark his 56th birthday, as other counties held similar functions that saw a total of 560,000 trees planted.
