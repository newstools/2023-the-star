A 29-year-old woman died by suicide after a domestic quarrel in Kasarani area, Nairobi. Preliminary findings show Brenda Kawira Gitonga jumped off the fourth floor of an apartment she and her boyfriend stayed in on Tuesday night after a brief quarrel. The boyfriend told police they had an argument before the woman walked out of their bedroom to the balcony. After a while, he said, he heard a loud thud and when he went to check her in the sitting room, kitchen and other rooms she was nowhere to be seen. He then decided to go to the balcony when he saw her body sprawled on the ground floor. Their neighbours rushed her to the Uzima hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. Police visited the scene whereby they found the deceased at the back seat of the car with visible injuries and bruises on her right thigh, left neck, left cheek and lower limb. Police said they are investigating the incident. The body was moved to the mortuary pending autopsy. In Rongo, Homa Bay, the body of one namely Oscar Owiti Dande, 30, and whose wife had left him after a domestic quarrel, was found dangling dead with a belt tied around the neck, inside his bedroom. Police suspect suicide as the cause of the death. Investigations into the incident are ongoing. Cases of suicide have been on the rise.
