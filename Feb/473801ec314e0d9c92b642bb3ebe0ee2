A Labour Migrant resource centre is set to be established in Kisumu to cover the Western and Nyanza regions. The centre will be set up at the Kisumu employment offices. According to the Acting Director of Corporate service National Employment Authority Caleb Okello, other centres outside Nairobi will be set up in Mombasa and Eldoret counties. Okello said the MRCs will provide information to aspiring migrant workers. The centre will also provide information for those who are also coming back to the country since they need information on how to reintegrate or settle back into society. He said the centre is supposed to provide them with information that will assist them to get financial literacy, psycho-social and legal assistants amongst others that they would need to help them resettle. Okello spoke in Kisumu where they met stakeholders to sensitize them on the labour migration resource centre which they intend to set up within the Kisumu employment offices. “Kisumu has been chosen for its catchment area to cover Nyanza and Western Regions, being that it’s a bit central point and can assist people within the neighbouring counties." He, however, noted that their intention is to set up the centre in many counties but due to the limited resources, they have so far settled on the three for now.
