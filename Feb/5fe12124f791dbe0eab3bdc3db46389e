Kenyan university students are increasingly relying on the internet for their education, but this dependence has negative impacts. One of the main drawbacks of relying on the internet for education is the lack of face-to-face interaction with lecturers. Lack of personal interaction can lead to a lack of understanding of the material and a lack of motivation to learn. Additionally, students may not have access to the same resources or support that they would have in a traditional classroom setting. Relying on the internet for education is the potential for technical difficulties. Internet connectivity can be unreliable in Kenya, leading to disruptions in online classes and difficulty accessing course materials. In addition, many students may not have access to the necessary technology, such as computers or stable internet connections, to fully participate in online classes. Lack of supervision and structure in online classes can lead to a decrease in academic performance. Without the accountability and support of a traditional classroom setting, some students may struggle to stay on track and complete assignments. The reliance on the internet for education also has negative economic impacts. The cost of purchasing technology and maintaining a stable internet connection can be a financial burden for many students. In addition, the loss of in-person instruction means that universities may need to reduce their staff, leading to job losses and an economic downturn. While the internet has made education more accessible for Kenyan university students, it has also brought about negative impacts. A balance must be struck between the convenience of online classes and the benefits of traditional, in-person instruction. Student at Rongo University
