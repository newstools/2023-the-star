A police officer was arrested after he assaulted a man with his gun butt in a confrontation in a village in Kiambu county. The incident happened in Karunga village at the weekend where one Moses Kimani reported that he had been assaulted by the officer attached to VIP protection of the General Service Unit, Nairobi. Kimani told police he had gone to a local shopping centre to buy a cake when he was confronted by two men on a motorcycle. One of the men who was later found to be the police officer alighted and hit him in the mouth using the pistol muzzle and butt on the jaw. He then fired two rounds in the air as the reportee escaped the scene scared. He later went to the local police station and reported the matter before he was rushed to hospital after the Saturday afternoon incident. Police said Kimani was bleeding at the time of the incident. The GSU officer was later arrested and disarmed of his Jericho pistol, which had 13 bullets. The officers said they are yet to establish the motive of the attack. The officer was expected to be processed ahead of possible prosecution. Kiambu police boss Perminus Kioi said they are investigating the incident. Elsewhere in Limuru, police are looking for a gang that attacked a taxi driver before vandalising his car in Manguo area. The driver told police he had been hired from Nairobi by two men to drop them in the area. On the way, one of the men drew a pistol and ordered him to an area where they tied his hands and legs and put him in the backseat. They then vandalised the car stealing its headlamps, indicators, bumper, side mirrors, car radio, four electric window switch panes and spark plugs. The gang dislocated the driverâ€™s left leg in the confrontation. The driver was taken to hospital as the hunt on the gang goes on. Police said no arrest had been made so far but a hunt on the men is ongoing. Such incidents are common in the area.
