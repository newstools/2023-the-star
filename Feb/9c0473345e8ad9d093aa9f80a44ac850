Former nominated senator Millicent Omanga has called out content creators for clout chasing. In a statement on Tuesday, Omanga said some content creators in Kenya are chasing clout to be praised. "It is simply clout chasing, some of our content creators are overdoing content creation for the sake of gushing praise," he said. The statement came hours after content creator Eric Omondi was arrested after he led other men in demonstrating against the rising cost of living in the streets of Nairobi. The placard-waving bare-chested men chanted bado mapambano (the struggle is on) as they made their way to Parliament buildings demanding an audience with Speaker Moses Wetang'ula. "Stima juu, maji juu, unga juu, tax juu" were the words written on the placards. The group sat across Parliament road, obstructing traffic, as they sang songs to rally youth not to sleep on their laurels in the face of a struggle for better living conditions. The group was, however, dispersed by police using tear gas as they attempted to storm Parliament buildings. The attempted forceful entry was prompted by the failure of the speaker to grant the group audience from within the precincts of Parliament. Some of the protesters, including Omondi, were bundled in a police van and driven away after a brief scuffle. The protest elicited mixed reactions from leaders. "Welcome aboard Eric Omondi…more people will join our movement of change … cost of living too high," Narok Senator Ledama Olekina said in a tweet following the protest. Former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga said an uprising is imminent. Mutunga said the action presented an opportunity for the rise of alternative political leadership. "Mass action has begun. Uprising is on the horizon. Great political opportunity for alternative political leadership in Kenya that is devoid of the political viruses of both Azimio and Kenya Kwanza," he said.
