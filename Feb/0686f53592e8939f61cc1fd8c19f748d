The counselling unit will, among other things, evaluate, design and lead an outreach programme that helps prevent mental health and substance abuse. Further, it will assist clients and families affected by mental health, substance abuse and trauma to overcome the problem. The unit will also participate in the formulation of counselling policies, regulations and strategies in conformity with the reform agenda and participate in the implementation, interpretation and review of counselling services, policies, procedures and systems.
