Bandits killing innocent Kenyans or police officers is becoming the norm in the recent past. In a country with functional government, this should not be allowed to continue.. But at the national and county level, government officers are only issuing empty threats instead of treating the banditry menace with the seriousness it deserves. Loss of one innocent life is already bad enough. However, when bandits kill police officers, who are tasked with providing security to wananchi, then issue then becomes a serious insult to those in authority and a challenge of their ability. Interior CS Prof Kindiki Kithure needs to take the bandit menace head on and prevent any further loss of life at the hands of these heartless murderers. Instead of holding press conferences, it is time the government goes in strongly, deploying the military to the bandit-prone areas. This will help in dealing with this menace once and for all in a precise manner. The locals in these areas know who is fueling these attacks, the bandits and who finances them. The state needs to use its machinery to gather intelligence on those funding the murderers and ruthlessly take action against them. Flush theÂ bandits out and prosecute those funding the thugs.
