Ugandan singer Jose Chameleone and his blood brother Weasel have elicited a mixed reaction once again after kissing on the lips on stage. This took place at Chameleon's 'Gwaja Mujje' show in Kampala. The two brothers kissed while performing together on stage. Fans criticised the move. "We are fighting homosexuality and our very own voices that we hope to raise," sarahpowerz said. "Yes, they are artists, celebrities, brothers, whatever it is… But in our culture, we are Africans. Such acts aren’t healthy for the growing youth out there." This is not the first time Chameleone and his other brother Weasel have shown affection for each other on stage. Last year, they shared a passionate kiss on the lips while performing at a concert in Bujumbura, Burundi. A few weeks ago, Chameleone and his brother Pallaso stirred a mixed reaction with their recent video, dancing while holding each other like lovers. The two were dancing in a very intimate manner in the undated video that surfaced online. The two are said to have been shooting a music video. Pallaso posted the short video on his Twitter account and captioned it: "Happiness matters. I love my brother. Bega Bega Remix dropping soon. Are you ready?"
