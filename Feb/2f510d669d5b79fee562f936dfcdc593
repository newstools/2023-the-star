President William Ruto has said the World bank has moved to support the Hustler Fund as a social fund aimed at helping the vulnerable in society. This comes after he held a meeting at Statehouse with a delegation from the monetary institution on Tuesday. The delegation was led by the Regional Vice President for Eastern and Southern Africa Victoria Kwakwa. "We appreciate the decision of the World Bank to recognise the Hustler Fund in cushioning the vulnerable in society," Ruto said. The president welcomed the monetary institutions' support. He said the technical assistance from the monetary institution will go a long way in making the fund more inclusive and transformative to millions of ordinary Kenyans. Kwakwa acknowledged the Bank’s work-in-progress climate resilience agenda that is based on the current drought. Ruto had selected an advisory board for the social fund though the court stopped their swearing-in. The board had been gazetted by Ruto and Cooperatives and MSME Development Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui last week. The board was stopped from discharging official functions on grounds that the President and the Cooperative CS handpicked the board, hence denying other qualified people a chance to be appointed. The fund is also yet to be constitutionalised with the Speaker of the National Assembly Moses Wetangu'ula urging legislators to ensure NG-CDF, Hustler fund and NGAAF are embedded in the 2010 Constitution. "I urge members to engage in meaningful deliberations leading to embedding the funds in the Constitution to regularise their availability for socio-economic development," Wetang'ula said.
