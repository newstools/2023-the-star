In form Gusii FC will on Wednesday seek to move to second place in the Football Kenya Federation National Super League when they take on Kajiado FC at Ildamat Stadium in Kajiado County. Gusii moved to third on the log after beating hosts and leaders Shabana 1-0 at Gusii Stadium in Saturday's derby with second-placed Kibera Stars within site. Despite Saturday's loss, Shabana still leads the log — with 25 points — but their lead has been cut to just three points. Kibera Black Stars are second with 23, two better of Gusii. Murang’a Seal, although on 21 points like Gusii, are fourth with an inferior goal difference. “It feels good to be in the top three. I believe that we will beat Kajiado and go second. They will be tough opponents but we shall work on winning the game,” said Gusii coach Kassim Junior. Kajiado are 13th on the log with seven points from 10 games. Kassim said the derby win will boost the team’s morale as they seek promotion to the Kenyan Premier League next season. He said they plan to beef up the team during the mid-season transfer window. Meanwhile, Shabana coach Sammy Okoth said there is no need to panic despite the consecutive losses against Gusii and Kibera Black Stars. “It is still too early to press the panic button. I didn’t expect us to play the way we played on Saturday. We need to mature in situations like a derby. The second consecutive loss for team is not healthy. We must forget the two loses and focus on upcoming games,” said Okoth, who is also eagerly -waiting for the transfer window. “Definitely, I will need some players but I don't want to talk about numbers at the moment since I am yet to identify potentials. I have a good team but it needs to be strengthened,” added Okoth. Elsewhere, Shabana chairman Nyandoro Kambi will be buried on Friday next week, club president Jared Nivaton announced on Sunday. He will be buried at his Kitengela home in Kajiado County.
