Deputy Minority leader Robert Mbui has called on the Kenya Kwanza government to elaborate on how the retired president Uhuru Kenyatta has affected the economy of Kenya. Speaking in an interview with Citizen TV on Monday, the Kathiani MP said that Kenya Kwanza should fulfil their manifestos as they promised during their campaigns, instead of blaming the retired president. “If you say that the problem is Uhuru, explain to us how Uhuru is affecting the prices now,” Mbui said. Mbui also added that politicians should be honest from the start and fulfil what they say during campaigns. "One thing we must do from the beginning is we have to be honest. I wish that the things they are telling us now were the same things they spoke just before the elections," said Mbui. He also urged the government to subsidize basic commodities to encourage development in the country. “Let’s just be realistic and say that there is a problem and people require some kind of support in subsidy,” he said. Mbui’s remarks come at the backdrop of claims by President Ruto's allies that the Kenya Kwanza government inherited a dilapidated economy. Speaking in September last year Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua said they inherited a broke government with no cash at the Treasury. He added that it would take months to get the country back on track. “The situation is very bad. There is no money in the Treasury. And the little that we are collecting goes to payment of salaries," Gachagua said.
