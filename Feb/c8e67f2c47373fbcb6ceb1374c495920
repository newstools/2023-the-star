Azimio spokesperson Makau Mutua has exuded confidence that Kisii Governor Simba Arati could one day become the president of Kenya. In a statement on Saturday, Mutua said that Arati is a principled, fearless and brilliant person. "Kisii Governor Simba Arati could one day become President of the Republic of Kenya. The man is principled, fearless, progressive, brilliant. Watch out," he said. The governor is a vocal politician and a dependable political mobiliser in Azimio leader Raila Odinga's camp from the years he served as Dagoretti North MP. He is a key ally to the opposition boss and has recently held meetings with President William Ruto. Arati vowed to work with the national government for the sake of development. The governor, on Thursday warmed up to Raila and welcomed him to Kisii county for the anti-Ruto rally. At first, Raila's trip faced a lot of resistance from a section of politicians allied with Ruto, including retired county governor James Ongwae. All eyes were on him on whether he would have joined Raila in the rally or not. Speaking during the rally, the governor told off former Kisii Governor James Ongwae for trying to block Raila in holding the rally in Kisii. "Some people were saying that the rally would not have happened, which meeting will not happen? The rally happened or not?" he said.
