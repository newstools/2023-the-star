Primary schools will next week receive Sh15,000 for every Grade 7 learner admitted to their school. Early learning and basic education PS Belio Kipsang said the reporting process has been successful. Kipsang was speaking at the Jomo Kenyatta Foundation headquarters where he launched form 1 scholarships. “We have already received approval for the capitation and schools will receive the money as early as next week,” Kipsang said. This week over 1.26 million learners were admitted to junior secondary. Even as the process progresses, Kipsang asked school managers to stick to school fees guidelines. “We shall not accept any teacher charging levies that are not legal,” he said. He said books have already been released in several parts of the country. This applies to both Form 1 and Grade 7 learners. “As you report you’ll find books in school, we shall ensure that in the shortest time possible your school fees will be released,” he added. Kipsang commissioned 3,000 scholarship beneficiaries that fall under the JKF scholarship.
