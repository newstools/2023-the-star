The government is exploring long-term projects to help re-invigorate sport tourism in the country to boost foreign arrivals, Cabinet Secretary for Tourism, Wildlife and heritage Peninnah Malonza. Speaking during the Magical Kenya Ladies Open in Vipingo Ridge, Kilifi County, the CS said the ministry would continue to utilise opportunities that sports events present in marketing Kenya to the world. CS Malonza noted that the flagship venue for the Magical Kenya Ladies Open at Vipingo Ridge (which is the only PGA accredited course in the region) is the jewel in the crown of Kenya’s ladies’ golf offering. She observed that the MKLO has worked hard to showcase the country to the world 'and shows that we have what it takes to host international tour events.' “As a government we are proud to have the title of Magical Kenya connected with the event. We are combining sports and tourism to showcase Kenya as a premier destination," Malonza said. "We are also telling the world that we are ready to host high profile events and not only golf, but the rest of the international events; and once they come to the country, they have an opportunity to visit some of our national reserves, game parks and beaches while sampling our rich culture.” Among the other high-profile events the country is poised to host this year include the Magical Kenya Open, WRC Safari Rally and the Kip Keino Classic. The CS also congratulated Kenyan amateur golfer Naomi Wafula for making the cut at the Ladies European Tour event. “I wish to congratulate Wafula who has entered her name in the annals of sports history as Kenya’s first ever lady to make the LET cut,” she said. Wafula posted a 78 for a three-day total of 14 over par 233. She made the historic cut on Thursday with two-day total of 9-over par 155.
