Africa Nazarene University coach Mike Oluoch is now a worried man after his teams lost their Kenya National Basketball League matches in Eldoret over the weekend. The Wolfpacks went down 59-56 to Eldonets Platinum while Panthers fell 65-58 to Eldonets in a high-scoring women’s game played at Uasin Gishu Primary School courts. “We were missing a lot. Our shots were not sinking and we had a lot of fouls and turnovers that really killed us,” said Oluoch. "I don’t really know what is wrong with the boys because we have been training really well. But the girls are not in deep problem. We have six games left for men with the women having four more to play.” Ulinzi Warriors are top of the standings with 34 points after they beat Lakeside 61-52 in Kisumu in a game that saw Eric Mutoro drain 20 points while Elisha Odhiambo shot 12. Equity Bank Dumas missed a chance to move joint top with the soldiers after they were deflated 52-49 by University of Nairobi Terrorists. Zetech University Titans remain in deep relegation worries after they were defeated 62-41 by Sadat Gaya-coached Thunder 62-41. Thunder are fourth with 30 points. Meanwhile, Kenyatta University tactician Caleb Osewe was a happy man  as his teams, Pirates and Oryx, posted crucial wins. Pirates led in all but the second quarter and went on to beat Umoja 60-50 with Trevor Opiyo showing the way with 12 points. Oryx, on the other hand, pipped Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) 36-35 with Jane Mumbi sinking the game clincher from the line. “It was a good day. We won because they played according to instructions. It was a must win for us because a loss now would have really complicated matters as strive to move away to safety,” Osewe said. "Oryx fought their skins off to be victorious because this would have landed us badly on a tight corner as it would have been a direct relegation.”
