Doctors have cast doubt on the ability of the National Health Insurance Fund to drive the Universal Health Coverage agenda. This is after the National Police Service and Kenya Prisons Service declined to renew a contract by NHIF for the officers’ comprehensive medical cover. NHIF was on December 16 informed it had lost the tender to a consortium of private insurance firms. The firms are led by CIC General Insurance Ltd (Leader of the Consortium), Old Mutual General Insurance Kenya Limited and Britam General Insurance Company (K) Limited. The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union now says the success of UHC can only be through investment in public institutions such as NHIF. “You cannot say that you want government institutions to work and the same government will take billions to private insurance companies yet we want to drive the UHC with NHIF,” KMPDU secretary general Davji Atellah said. “We need to value the public sector and for it to work we must invest the money back into the public, not into the private sector. Working with the private is profit making.” This is a big loss for NHIF given the two agencies were seen as some of the biggest clients. NPS Principal Administrative Secretary Bernice Lemedeket said NHIF quoted Sh9.3 billion whereas the winners quoted Sh8.6 billion and hence lost. “We regret to inform you that your bid was unsuccessful for the reasons that it was not the lowest technically responsive bid in the financial evaluation,” she said. NHIF has been offering the cover for almost eight years and insiders said it was fairly better.
