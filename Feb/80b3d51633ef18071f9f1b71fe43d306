National champions Nairobi Water Queens coach Jack Ochieng has sounded the warning bells as they battle for a tenth successive Kenya handball league title. Queens earned a second walkover this season after Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) failed to show up on Sunday. Daystar University also skipped their first leg fixture against the champions. “I am going for an all out win. No draws, no losses,” he warned, adding: “These teams cannot improve on their skills that way.” Ochieng is worried that getting just 15 goals from the walkover, when they could have rattled in more, may impact on their goal aggregate thus putting his title defence in jeopardy. Unbeaten Water Queens have goal aggregate of 609-179, second placed Ulinzi Sharks 539-191 and National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) who are third on 573-230. Queens, who are also the reigning regional champions, have 30 points from 15 games. Sharks are second with 24 points from 13 games, same as NCPB, who have played a game more. “I have had four tight matches, against Sharks, NCPB, Rangers and Net Navigators and I promise you I will stifle every opponent  going forward,” said Ochieng. Meanwhile, KHF league coordinator George Asimeto said a clash between league Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) occasioned the two walkovers in the league. “We have tried our best to balance matches between the two leagues but sometimes the fixtures clash and teams fail to appear. We will have a meeting with them to sort it out,” said Asimeto. He said the league is expected to end by the end of March, take a two-week break and then resume as they chase a November deadline for this year’s programme. The Super Cup, which will determine the two teams to represent the country at the continental championships, will throw off in April. Six top men’s team will be entered for the event.
