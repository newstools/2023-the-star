A petitioner has asked the National Assembly to interrogate revenues collected by Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) from the Standard Gauge Railways (SGR). Amos Nyasani argued that there has been a lack of transparency pertaining to revenues collected by the KRC for both passenger and freight services since its inception. He stated that efforts to get answers on the matter through the National Treasury and Economic Planning, Roads, Transport and Public Works, Lands, Housing and Urban Development ministries and KRC have not been forthcoming. “Petitioner, therefore, prays that the National Assembly interrogates the Kenya Railways Corporation and other relevant State Departments on the general operations and the revenues collected by the Kenya Railways Corporation,” Deputy Speaker Gladys Boss Shollei said in her communication to the House. In the petition, Nyasani stated that in 2019, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) jointly issued a directive for the clearance of transit cargo from the Port of Mombasa to Naivasha Inland Container Depot (NICD). He noted that later in 2022, however, a new directive was issued to revert the services back to the Port of Mombasa. A report released by the Kenya Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) in May 2022 said the number of passengers using the Madaraka Express increased from 806,000 in 2020 to 1,993,000 in 2021. The 2022 KNBS economic survey indicated that revenue from cargo haulage on the SGR rose by 24 per cent from Sh10.5 billion to Sh13 billion bringing the total SGR revenue to Sh15.2 billion.
