Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga has acquired laptops for her executive committee members in a bid to ensure they have paperless Cabinet sittings. Homa Bay becomes the first county to have a fully digitised Cabinet, borrowing from the national government Cabinet which went digital on January 31. "Exciting news! Our Cabinet has gone fully digital and paperless, with a goal to enhance time utilisation, increase efficiency, and enable remote participation and collaboration whenever needed," Wanga said in a statement. "This step will not only streamline our processes but also contribute to a greener environment. Let's work together towards a more efficient and sustainable future," she added.
