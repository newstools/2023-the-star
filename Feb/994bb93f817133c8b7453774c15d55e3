Retired President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged leaders to avoid tribalism and embrace former Education CS the late George Magoha. "Let us love each other as Kenyans, just the way Magoha did, tribalism, nepotism, and ethnicity never bothered Magoha, let us follow in his footsteps," he said. He also said the people of Gem should produce more professors, academic giants and leaders like Magoha. "Produce more for our great country Kenya," he said on Saturday during Magoha's burial. Uhuru also said Magoha decisively restored the sanity and credibility of national exams while he served as the chairperson of the National Examinations Council. He lauded Magoha for restoring the integrity of the country's national examinations. "I had been impressed by what he did as the vice chancellor of the University of Nairobi," he said. Uhuru said that before Magoha took charge of Knec, the country was at the time experiencing massive cheating in national examinations. "Many of you would recall the numerous examination cheating that used to take place," he said. Uhuru was accompanied by ODM leader Raila Odinga and former CSs during his tenure. Other leaders present during the mass were ICT CS Edwin Owalo, Education CS Ezekiel Machogu and Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang among others. Magoha died on January 24 aged 71.
