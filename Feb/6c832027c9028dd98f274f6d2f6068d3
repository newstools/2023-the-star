Every county government has been tasked with ensuring last-mile delivery of fertilizer to farmers in the counties. The agreement was arrived at during the national governors’ summit held in Naivasha early this month. “The fertilisers being delivered in the counties are unique to the different soil types identified in those counties based on previous surveys done,” the communiqué says. This comes even as the government reiterated the intention to invest in fertiliser production as a long-term plan to tackle the high cost of living. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mithika Linturi announced plans by the government to import the farm input from the neighbouring country of Tanzania starting July this year as a short-term measure. Linturi further promised farmers that the government will continue subsidising fertiliser at the current price of Sh3,500 until a lasting solution is found. According to Linturi, 287,000 bags of subsidised fertiliser have so far been sold to maize farmers. "Maize farmers on the platform are 1.08 million. The bags delivered are 287,000 translating to 14,300 metric tons, " Linturi said. To access the government's subsidised fertilisers, farmers must be registered digitally with data showing that as of February 2023, 4.3 million farmers have been registered. The fast-tracked continuous farmer registration exercise began on January 6, 2023. About 10 million (50kg) bags of assorted fertiliser will be availed to farmers under the subsidy fertiliser programme for the long rains season.
