Renowned city pastor Rev Lucy Natasha has asked her followers to pray for those in the ministry. Through her Instagram page, she said being a pastor is stressful and sometimes very painful. Natasha said although the ministry work seems easy, it is not. "There is a lot of expectations of being perfect, yet they help others with their imperfections. Pray for those in ministry. Pray for your pastor. Mama Oracle," she wrote. The flamboyant preacher has many times faced backlash from her followers for various reasons. A few years ago while receiving her Covid-19 jab on her upper left arm, her followers noticed she had a tattoo emblazoned with the word ‘Oracle’. Another time, she was allegedly accused of hiring the same man to perform different miracles.
