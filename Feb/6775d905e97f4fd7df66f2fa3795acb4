The Judiciary hopes to establish 100 fully operational small claims courts across the country in the next five years, Chief Justice Martha Koome has said. CJ Koome said this is part of the Judiciary's vision of Social Transformation through Access to Justice. Koome said she hopes to ensure access to efficient commercial justice that supports the countryâ€™s quest for economic development. "The rollout strategy for these courts envisages that we will start from Nairobi and border towns before we move to other urban areas," she said. CJ Koome spoke during the development partners' roundtable in support of the Judiciary's vision at the Safari Park Hotel on Monday. She thanked the Kingdom of the Netherlands and IDLO which have already expressed their intention to support the rollout of the Small Claims Courts in the border towns. CJ Koome said they are keen on rolling out Sexual Gender-Based Violence courts in hotspot areas. "We already have one SSGV court in Shanzu-Mombasa," she said. Civil society groups working to end sexual violence have been calling for such specialised courts to help survivors access justice faster and in a more dignified manner. "These courts will be trauma-informed courts with facilities and personnel who can guarantee justice to victims in a manner that is responsive to their needs and sensitivities," the CJ said.
