Foreign and Diaspora Affairs CS Alfred Mutua on Monday met with the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General to South Sudan Nicholas Haysom. They held discussions on the need for peace in South Sudan. Mutua said he informed Haysom of the importance of an all-inclusive peace in the Horn of Africa. He pointed out that the goal will be realised when there is peace and stability in South Sudan. "I reminded him that Kenya had birthed and midwifed the Sudan Peace Process, consistent with Kenya's role as an anchor State and guarantor of regional peace and security," the CS said. Mutua pointed out that economic inequality, had contributed to a number of global challenges, including regional conflicts. "I observed that sustained investments, as well as positive regional integration will allow for a more competitive, economically prosperous, and secure Africa." On his part, Haysom acknowledged the inadequacy in humanitarian aid in the South Sudan, which has been aggravated by ongoing drought. He called upon Kenya to employ her influence in imploring for South Sudan's peace.
