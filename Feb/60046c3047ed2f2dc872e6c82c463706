Vihiga Queens head coach Boniface Nyamunyamu and his Bunyore Starlets counterpart Daniel Arunga are against a proposed downgrading of the sports kitty by the Vihiga County government. County Executive Committee member in charge of sports in Vihiga has revealed that they intend to reduce their direct financing of teams and divert the funds into building sports infrastructure including stadia. However, the two Women's Premier League coaches believe slashing the budget will cripple teams who depend on the funding to run their day-to-day activities. Nyamunyamu observed that majority of the teams are already struggling despite the financial boost from the county and a further decrease would be detrimental. He said the county should instead look for other avenues to finance the construction and rehabilitation of facilities. This, he said, would be crucial for both the teams and the county in the future. The teams will not need hefty amounts to hire grounds while the county will have platforms to help nurture talent, he observed. "Once we have our own playing grounds, we shall be able to cut down on expenses, including hiring grounds as well as travelling costs,” said Nyamunyamu. "But at the moment, the county should continue facilitating our teams." He proposed an upgrade on their current home ground, Mumboha alongside Kidundu and Kaimosi Stadium. Vihiga County has a number of teams in the various national and regional leagues including Vihiga Bullets (Kenyan Premier League), Vihiga United (National Super League) as well as Luanda Villa and Luanda Sportive,  who play in Division I. Vihiga Queens and Bunyore Starlets ply their trade in the Football Kenya Federation Women's Premier League. "We are using these teams as away of keeping our young boys and girls out of crime, drugs and other societal vices vices and we therefore need to sustain the teams," said Arunga.
