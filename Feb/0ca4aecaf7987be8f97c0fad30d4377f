Vlogger Natalie Tewa got engaged over the weekend. In a series of posts on her Insta-stories, the Kenyan beauty announced her engagement to one Francis Mugane and showed off her beautiful diamond engagement ring. Alongside a post of her hand wearing a new piece of jewellery, a happy Natalie posted, "In the spirit of love, I have some news. I said yesâ€¦ did the damn thing." In another post she added that she was caught by surprise as her man kept the whole proposal a secret. "He hid this from me very well. Diamond looks very good on me and you know my style very well. Love it. May God bless our union," she wrote. From his social media, Mbugua works as a strategy and operations manager at a booking company. A year ago, Natalie told Word Is she is a sucker for love and a relationship girl. At the time, she said she was in a new relationship. "I am always in a relationship. I am somewhere there and looking to get married. There is someone very new and we are just taking things slowly." Natalie added that she wanted like 10 children when she was young. "Where is the man to give me 10 kids? I now want to push five. But the way things are going, let me just have three or four. I love kids and I love nurturing." She broke up with her ex-lover Moses Mukiibi, popularly known as Rnaze, four years ago. The YouTuber had kept her love life private.
