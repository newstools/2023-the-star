The former multi-billion HIV/Aids village in Imbirrikani that was abandoned by an American philanthropist, Anne Lori, is now a Level IV hospital in Kajiado. The funding for the former largest HIV/Aids outreach in East and Central Africa fizzled out after American well-wishers pulled out after 2010. Chicago-based Lori was forced to close down the facility after donors failed to support the multibillion shillings project employing doctors in their hundreds at the outreach hospital. On Wednesday evening, the county government turned the overhauled rusty facility into a level 4 hospital facility to serve the people Imbirrikani/Eselenkei ward in Kajiado South sub-county. The new Imbirrikani hospital, complete with modern equipment, will accept NHIF Cards, further easing the cost of medical care for the local community. The hospital was commissioned by Governor Joseph Lenku, who, when doing so said: "I have fulfilled one of my campaign pledges for the people of Imbirikani-Eselenkei Ward whom I promised a Level Four Hospital.” He added" "I urge local the residents to enrol for NHIF medical cover so they can enjoy the services provided by the hospital.” The governor thanked Fahari ya Jamii, funded by the University of Nairobi, and World Vision for being dependable partners in health sector issues in Kajiado. In 2019, the Imbirrikani community supported by governor Lenku rejected a request made by the Kenya Medical Training Institute to turn the facility into a national medical training college, and a hospital for the community.
