Kari village in Kahuro sub-county, Murang’a County is in Shock after the body of a 31-year-old man was found hanging on a tree on Friday. The body of Charles Moko was found by his brother Simon Mburu on a farm and had been stripped naked. Mburu said he saw something dangling from a tree and got closer to find out what it was his brother who had been murdered. “His body had knife wounds on the chest and his private parts had been cut off and left near the body,” Mburu said. He confirmed that there were knives and a machete left at the scene and other items that the deceased used in his work at a butchery in the Kari shopping centre. Mary Waithera, a neighbour, said the murder had left the village shaken and that they could not understand why anybody would commit such a heinous act. She said Moko was a hardworking man and that he had been employed to barbecue meat in a butchery. But a section of locals said his character was questionable and that he had been arrested severally after being found in possession of bhang. “He was also very stubborn. You could not send him anywhere. I told him to stop smoking bhang many times but he could not listen to me,” a relative said. Kahuro deputy county commissioner Fred Muli confirmed that the deceased had his private organs severed
