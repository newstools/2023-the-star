Cancer is among the top three killers in Kenya, coming only 3rd to infectious and cardiovascular diseases. It is estimated that the incidences of cancer have risen by 29.4 per cent in the last decade from an estimated 32,000 to 47,887 new cases annually. The deaths caused by cancer have also risen during the same period from 28,500 to 32,987. These are not just numbers, they are families grieving, breadwinners lost, children orphaned and empty dinner seats, heartbroken widows and widowers not to mention the financial distress that accompanies the treatment and funerals.
