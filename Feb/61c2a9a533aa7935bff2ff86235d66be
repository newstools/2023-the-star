Posh Palace CEO Susan Kaitanny says the hate is too much ahead of the premiere of The Real Housewives of Nairobi show. Speaking during the Morning Kiss, Kaitanny said the cast has made Kenya proud. "Guys are already criticising us but after watching episode one, you will know that we have made Kenya proud," she said. The reality show premiered on Showmax last night, with new episodes dropping every Thursday. The 'Real Housewives of Nairobi' follows five influential and successful women as they navigate their lavish lifestyles, relationships and careers in Nairobi, Kenya. Susan said before the cast was confirmed, they had to prove they don't fake their lifestyles. "You have to prove that your lifestyle is legit before they pick you for the reality show. You can't be faking it," she said. She said the show is not about how much money the women have but how bold they bring out the 'savage' part of them. "It equalises all of us. It is about how savage you are and how bold you bring it out. Your personality as a woman," she said.
