The defence will be crucial to Mean Machine as the battle to avoid relegation in the Kenya Cup intensifies this weekend The three-time champions face Strathmore Leos in a varsity derby on Saturday and head coach Nick Abok says the 22-18 win over Mwamba, their second win of the season, has given them momentum ahead of the weekend showdown. “The boys are relishing the challenge but our defence must get better. We are training thrice a week and I hope this will be sorted," said Abok Machine are currently placed 10th on the log with 14 points—one ahead of Strathmore (13)  and Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) bottom of the log with eight points. Commenting on the upcoming game against Strathmore, the tactician said there are areas the team can exploit against last season's losing semifinalist. "I believe they have weaknesses that we can exploit on Saturday." Abok added he was not looking at the table but concentrating on the upcoming game and the final group phase match against KCB next weekend. "I'm not looking at the log and we don't need favours from other teams to survive. We need to focus on our games and win and the rest will take care of itself,” added Abok The former Impala coach says he is delighted with the team's attack in recent weeks which has seen them scoring. “ Our attack looks sharp. We scored 27 against Blak Blad and 24 against Masinde Muliro. So if we can tighten our defence then we can stay in the top flight,"  said Abok. The battle to avoid relegation to the championship next season also features sixth-placed Nakuru RFC who are on 18 points with Homeboyz and Mwamba placed seventh on 15 points apiece. Catholic Monks are ninth on 14 points The bottom two teams get relegated to the championship next season.
