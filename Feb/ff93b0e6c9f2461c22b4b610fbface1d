A man who had been employed as a branch manager of a private company was on Monday arraigned in court over Sh420,000 theft. Patrick Wambua Mwikya was arraigned before Kibera resident magistrate Jacqueline Muthoni Ojwang when the matter came up for hearing. According to the charge sheet, the accused person committed the offence on diverse dates from between January and July 2021 at South Lemon Limited in Westlands Nairobi county. The court heard that the accused person had been employed by the company and deployed to Eldoret as the branch manager. While testifying, Joseph Mbuvi, a senior officer from the company said the accused failed to account for Sh420,000 while serving as the branch manager in Eldoret before disappearing "He was called to bring some Sh420,000 from the sales he had made at our Eldoret Branch but he failed to do so," Mbuvi said. "Instead of handing over the money he asked for permission to go look for the cash and never came back." The court heard that after one year the accused returned to the same company and requested to be reemployed so that he can repay the money. It was during that time when the officers from Parklands police station were called and arrested him. The accused person denied the accusations saying he never committed the offence and the charges were fabricated. The matter will proceed next month and the accused person while the accused was released on a 150,000 cash bail.
