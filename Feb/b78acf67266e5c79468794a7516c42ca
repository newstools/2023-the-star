A first-generation iPhone has sold for over $63,000 in the US, about Sh7.9 million at the current exchange rate. According to CNN, the phone which cost around $600 (Sh75,000) back then, features a 3.5-inch screen, 2 megapixels camera and 8 GB of storage space. A tattoo artiste said she got it as a gift 16 years ago but never opened the box. The phone was still covered with the original shrink wrap by the time it went up for auction. Karen Green, who go the phone as a gift from her friends just after landing a new job, had just bought another phone. She explained in a different interview that she never wanted to get rid of the new phone and figured it would be okay to keep the gift since she figured "it was an iPhone so it will never go out of date".
