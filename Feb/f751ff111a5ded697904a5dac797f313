Education Cabinet Secretary Ezekiel Machogu has issued Junior Secondary Education (JSE) guidelines even as students are yet to commence classes, three days after admission. In a statement, Machogu said the guidelines will provide information that is necessary for the effective implementation of JSS across the country. "This guideline will serve as a reference document for field officers and school managers in the successful implementation of JSS as a distinct level of education in Kenya," he said. The guideline also outlines how school managers and officials will facilitate a seamless transition from Primary School (Grade 6) to JSS "It also emphasises the need for provision of adequate, appropriate, and safe physical infrastructure and learner friendly environment for all including those with disabilities," the statement read. The CS also said, after the JSS, a learner is expected to communicate effectively, verbally and non-verbally, in diverse contexts, and demonstrate social skills, spiritual and moral values for peaceful co-existence. "We expect them to explore, manipulate, manage and conserve the environment effectively for learning and sustainable development, practise relevant hygiene, sanitation and nutrition skills to promote health," he said. "Demonstrate ethical behaviour and exhibit good citizenship as a civic responsibility and apply digital literacy skills for communication and learning." This is the first cohort of JSS to be integrated into the Competency-Based Curriculum following its implementation in 2017.
