Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga has warned that she will take legal action against conmen who use her name to swindle money from residents. In a statement, the conmen working in a group are operating pseudo-social media accounts with Wanga’s name. They operate two Facebook accounts with the governor’s name whose full name is Gladys Atieno Nyasuna Wanga. The conmen hoodwink residents and then fall into their traps through two Facebook accounts namely Gladys Atis Wanga and Gladys Atis. The conmen tell the residents to pay application fees to get loans and savings from their financial institution. They claim they are managing the institution on behalf of Wanga. Residents asked to pay various fees which include Sh850 for registration, Sh1850 for insurance, Sh1250 for stamp duty, Sh2050 for CRB, Sh1100 for transaction and Sh3200 for double dialling. “The listed amounts are the fees one needs to pay to be given a loan of Sh100,000,” the statement read. Homa Bay government spokesperson Rachel Ogutu said Wanga has taken the issue to the Homa Bay police station for investigations. Ogutu said they have received complaints from some residents who have lost their money through the conman ship. One of the residents has lost Sh10,500. Police have already identified two men who are linked to the accounts. “The two men are in police custody. Legal action is going to be taken against them,” Ogutu said. She warned residents with such intentions to stop and urged them to be wary of such conmen since the governor does not run any funds scheme. “It should be known that the governor does not have a financial institution for lending people money.  Those are masqueraders and nobody should pay attention to them,” she said.
