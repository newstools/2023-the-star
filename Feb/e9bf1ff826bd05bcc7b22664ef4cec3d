A matatu driver was on Tuesday found lying dead inside a 14-seater matatu in Mwingi town. TheÂ 50-year-old man was an employee of a renown matatu sacco in the town. He was identified as Muoki Sila from Nzawa area of Nguutani Ward, Mwingi West, Kitui county. Confirming the incident, acting Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Kazungu Charo said investigations on what could have caused his death have begun. His death came as a shocker to many who said he never showed any signs of illness. Patrick Musyoki, a fellow driver, said they were together on Monday at Mwingi bus park when the deceased was heading to Tseikuru. "He was from Kitui enroute to Tseikuru and had no signs of illness," he said After getting to the market, he went back to Mwingi where he was supposed to travel back to Kitui on Tuesday morning. However, his lifeless body was discovered by fellow drivers lying at the back seat of the vehicle. "I received a call from a boda boda rider who informed me that my friend had passed on and was inside the matatu he was driving." Musyoki added that the deceased hardly operated on the Kitui-Mwingi -Tseikuru and was in denial that his colleague had passed on. However, he went at the bus park and found him lying dead inside the matatu. Joseph Munyoki, a tout, said Muoki loaded his car and left for Tseikuru on Monday evening. "He was his usual self and was not sick at all and we have never heard him complain of any ill-health," he added. The body was moved to Mwingi Level 4 Hospital mortuary awaiting autopsy.
