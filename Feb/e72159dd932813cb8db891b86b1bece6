Kakamega's Princess Aluko and Ibrahim Mohamed from Mandera county have been crowned the winners of the brand new proton saga in the ongoing Gurumisha Ndege Uwahi Dinga promotion by Mozzartbet on Aviator on Thursday. The new Proton Saga is a Malaysian brand that is locally assembled in Mombasa and is built to withstand the tough Kenyan roads.  The Proton Saga is equipped with convenient functions to make driving easier. Speaking at the award ceremony, Proton product manager, Faruk Alibhai said: "Simba Corp brought in the Proton Saga about two years ago and the idea was to bring in a car that is brand new and most affordable to Kenyans. With the support of Mozzartbet, Proton Saga is promoting Kenyan Jobs by giving Kenyan manufacturers a chance to assemble the car." Mozzartbet awarded 30 cars in December 2021 alone, giving out one car each day of the month. Princess Aluko, who is a teacher in Kakamega, says she plans to use her brand new car to generate income for herself and give employment opportunities to other people. She says she could not believe she had won. "When was told I am one of the lucky winners, I did not believe it. I thought the people on the phone were fraudsters." Aside from prize competitions,  the company also has corporate social responsibility programs where they donate medical equipment to hospitals countrywide. They have also provided water boreholes to communities in semi-arid areas.
