Mara Sugar coach Francis Xavier has challenged his charges to bounce back to winning ways when they face Kisumu All Stars at Awendi Green Stadium. Coach Xavier is keen to strengthen the team when the transfer window opens. “I’m not going to overhaul the team. I will only sign a defender, a midfielder and a striker. I will go for experienced players because the league is very competitive,” he told the Star on phone.
