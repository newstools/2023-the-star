L’Oréal has appointed Yassine Bakkari as the new managing director for East Africa, with his predecessor Serge Secre taking a similar role in the South African market. Yassine’s appointment comes as the global cosmetics giant implements its ambitious sustainability programme, establishing the company’s vision with a notable focus on the impact of its products during the use phase. Prior to joining East Africa, Yassine was the operations director for L’Oréal Middle East where he developed an omnichannel transformation of the group’s four divisions by creating a unified experience across e-commerce, retail and deep trade. He then moved to Morocco as general manager for the Consumer Division, deploying the division’s strategy in developing a brand portfolio and equity that cemented L’Oréal’s market leadership. Commenting on his appointment, Bakkari said East Africa is a rapidly growing region where digital transformation and consumer experience will be key to success. "As a global company producing some of the world’s most trusted brands like L’Oréal Paris, Garnier, Mizani, Nice & Lovely among others, this region is a critical part of L’Oréal’s efforts to create the beauty that moves the world," Bakkari said. He added that he is happy to collaborate with L’Oréal’s employees and partners to offer immediate value for consumers across the region and strengthen extra-financial performance through programmes 'L’Oréal For the Future, Beauty for a Better Life or L’Oréal For Youth'. In his capacity as managing director, Yassine will oversee the entire East African cluster including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia. Africa is a big and fundamental market for L’Oréal. In the last decade, Egypt, Nigeria and East Africa have come online to join South Africa, Morocco and Ghana where L’Oréal previously had a presence.
