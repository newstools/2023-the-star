China Square has announced that it will close down on Sunday after Trade CS Moses Kuria and traders frowned upon it. In a statement, owner Lei Cheng alias Charlie said he will take time to re-evaluate and re-plan the business's strategy. "We regret to inform you that China Square Limited will be temporarily closed on Sunday, February 26,2023," the statement reads in part. The announcement comes after claims that China Square has driven Kenyan traders out of business with lowly priced goods. Cheng said the company was considering cooperation with local traders with an aim to better integrate itself with the community. He apologised to the customers, urging them to visit the shop on Monday after it reopens. "Our commitment to providing you with the highest level of service remains as strong as ever, and we look forward to re-opening on Monday, February 27, with a renewed focus on meeting your expectations," the retailer said. On Friday, Trade CS Moses Kuria said that as much as Kenya welcomes Chinese investors, they were here as manufacturers and not traders. He said he had held talks with the Kenyatta University Vice Chancellor Prof Paul Wainaina on the shop's lease. "I have today given an offer to Prof Wainaina the VC Kenyatta University to buy out the lease for China Square, Unicity Mall and hand it over to the Gikomba, Nyamakima, Muthurwa and Eastleigh Traders Association," he said. China Square is located at Unicity Mall on Thika road. In the past few days, it has taken shoppers by storm attracting criticism from local traders. The retailer offers items at the most affordable prices, according to Kenyans on social media.
