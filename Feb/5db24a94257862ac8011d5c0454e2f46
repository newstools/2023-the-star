Security officers previously attempted to access former Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi's home prior to Wednesday's break-in, the Star has learned. A guard at the Karen Ngong View homestead said a team of officers had been making visits to the home since February 8. Details of their visit were still scanty but the guard said a team of officers also visited the home on Monday morning. "They came in two cars and were heavily armed...after a brief encounter they left," the guard told the Star. He stated that the officers also demanded the contact of their boss, the security firm manager. "We gave them the details and explained to them where our offices are located," he said. On Wednesday afternoon, officers raided the residence. Neither Matiang'i nor his family members were present at the time. The officers forcefully gained entry into the compound before breaking into the rooms. A guard who was on duty at the time was bundled into the boot of one of the vehicles used by the officers as the search continued inside. Some other workers at the home guided the officers as they went from one room to the other. Lawyer Danstan Omari was at the home. By the time of going to press, Matiang'i had not arrived at the residence. However, Azimio leader Raila Odinga had arrived at the home.
