Eldoret Water volleyball team manager Kenneth Arusei is eyeing promotion to the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) National League next season. The  Eldoret Water and Sewerage Company (ELDOWAS)-sponsored team start their journey to stardom this Saturday in the men's  Division 2 league at the Nyayo Stadium. Arusei said they are training daily to ensure they pick maximum points and earn the promotion come next year's top tier. “We are now training well at our courts before heading to Nairobi for the league. Initially, we used to train at the Eldoret Sports Club with the Uasin Gishu team but we relocated to our field for easy players' access. Preparing for such a league is not easy,” said Arusei. He said they have been involved in build-up friendly matches since joining the second division. “We started well winning in some tournaments and we were the semifinalists during the Eldoret City Volleyball tournament held in Eldoret in December after losing to Ziwa team in the self-sponsored clubs' cadre,” added Arusei. The Eldoret-based team will serve off against National Youth Service n the six-team league at the Nyayo Stadium on Saturday before facing off with Base Yetu on Sunday. They will be up against Base Yetu, DOD CAU, Microspikers, NYS and Pamoja Tuijenge.
