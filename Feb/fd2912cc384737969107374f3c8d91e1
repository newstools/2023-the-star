Guardian Angel's wife Esther Musila says she she still cannot understand why haters don't like her being married to the gospel singer. The two have been victims of cyberbullying amid their massive age gap of 20 years. Guardian Angel, 32, and Esther Musila, 52, got married at a colourful wedding in January 2022. This came after Guardian Angel's beautiful proposal to Esther Musila in May 2021 as she celebrated her 51st birthday. Esther Musila, who constantly fights back against social media bullies, had a Q and A session with her fans on Instagram. She said she will never allow anyone to speak ill on her page. "Most bullies think that silence means you are weak. I will give you a taste of your own medicine if I have to," she said. "People need to heal from what hurts them. How do you hate someone for their relationship?" She told a fan who asked her if she was planning to get a baby with Guardian to concentrate on things that could add value in her life. In the past, Musila also revealed that she lost many friends after word went viral that she was dating Guardian, a younger man than her. "I lost so many friends. They started gossiping, and I was shocked that someone I last expected to talk ill of our relationship was one of the gossipers," she said.
