Three students were Wednesday morning injured in a fire incident in their dormitory at Kangemi High School, Nairobi. The fire broke out Wednesday dawn at 1 am in one of the dormitories that housed 100 students. Police said the fire broke out at Mathai Dormitory and consumed beds and students' personal items of unknown value before it was contained. It was as the students fought to contain the spread of the fire that three were injured in the hand, shoulder and head respectively. They were treated at a local clinic and discharged, police and the school administration said. Fire engines from Nairobi City County arrived there and helped in containing the spread. Nairobi police boss Adamson Bungei said they are yet to establish the cause of the fire but investigations are ongoing. “Experts are on the ground to know what caused the fire,” said Bungei. The affected students’ parents and guardians were informed of the incident and urged to take them their personal effects. Meanwhile, a 45-year-old man died in a fire incident in Uthiru area, Nairobi. The remains of David Mburu Kiberu were discovered long after the Sunday night fire had been contained. The incident happened in the Ndumbuini area, where Kiberu stayed in a house serving as a store and acted as a caretaker of another one, which is under construction. The owner of the house said he had gone to check on the progress of the house under construction when he realized the store was on fire and was locked from the inside. He said he tried to open it in vain. This forced him to call for help from locals who contained the fire and later found the remains of the man. It is not clear if he died by suicide or if the fire was started by accident. The remains were taken to the mortuary pending probe and autopsy.
