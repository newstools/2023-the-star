Political analyst and politician Peter Kagwanja has warned that there is a lot of weaponisation of taxes in the country. The university professor said Kenya Kwanza and Azimio politicians are culprits in the weaponisation. For instance, the analyst said, the government is hardening its position to justify that its agenda has not taken off because some people have not been paying taxes. Saying that the new battlefront is a continuation of the hustler versus the dynasties war, Kagwanja said the big boys are weaponising tax as a tool for mobilisation. "It's just the hustler versus dynasties continuing, this time within the framework of weaponisation, by both cases, of taxes as an instrument of galvanising revolution," he said on KTN News. "What we are witnessing now is the hustler versus dynasties struggle, second round; the first round the dynasties were in power, in the second round the hustlers are in power." He said o Wednesday that over the last three weeks, there has been a lot of weaponisation of taxes that is mobilising and hardening positions in government. "We must see the issue of taxes within the framework of radicalisation of our politics. It is everything to do with the rattling that has come from Kenya Kwanza's decision to go for the big guys in terms of paying taxes," he said. He said, the world over, taxes have also been an indicator of whether the government is performing well or not. "Taxes have always been behind revolutions. What we are witnessing now is the dynasty versus hustler struggle, in this case, the weaponisation of taxes by going for the big guys," he said. President William Ruto has rattled the opposition alleging that Azimio is shielding influential people from paying taxes. Ruto's allies have alleged that retired President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is the chairman of Azimio, has been exempting his family from paying taxes on properties and businesses.
