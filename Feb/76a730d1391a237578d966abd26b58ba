Senate proceedings have been suspended for 15 minutes after chaos rocked the house for the fourth day. The chaos broke out after speaker Amason Kingi failed to effect changes to the minority wing. Deputy Speaker Kathure Murungi ordered the suspension of proceeding after the minority senators staged a show, camping on the floor and shouting at the speaker to effect changes. In the melee, Murungi ordered Minority leader Stewart Madzayo, his Deputy Enoch Wambua and Narok senator Ledama Olekina out of the chamber for the next three sittings. The move triggered fierce protests as the house degenerated into chaos. The chaos occurred as the Deputy Speaker made a communication on the changes where he declined to effect the changes on the strength of a court order that temporarily stopped the move. "Follows standing orders. Atolewe," a senator is heard saying. In the changes, the minority coalition has removed Isiolo senator Fatuma Dullo as Senate minority whip. On Tuesday, Murungi said that the speaker's office had been served with a court order suspending Dullo's removal. On Wednesday, he said that he will not effect the changes until the case filed by Dullo is heard and determined. "In the circumstances and taking into account the provisions of Articles of the constitution... I, therefore, the communication on this matter pending the determination of the case that is before the tribunal, " Kathuri said. On Tuesday, the minority senators walked out of the chamber after the speaker failed to deliver the communication.
