National Assembly Deputy Speaker Gladys Boss Shollei has defended Nominated MP Sabina Chege over what she termed as an unwarranted attack against the legislator. In a statement on Tuesday, Shollei said it was regrettable that the Azimio team was disrespecting Chege after the effort and support she showed during the 2022 campaign period. She added that it was 'appalling' that crude remarks directed to women were heard in the Azimio rallies yet Narc Kenya Martha Karua remained silent. Shollei called on Karua to help defend her fellow women in politics. "At the very least, we ask Hon Martha Karua to put her foot down and refuse this wanton attempt to turn Azimio events into the place women leaders are insulted, demeaned and subjected to mean-spirited name-calling and uncalled-for sexual innuendos," she said. "If they can insult their own Deputy Minority Leader Hon Sabina Chege who is the highest ranking woman leader in Azimio today, one wonders what they are prepared to do to the Proverbial Wanjiku." Chege is among the Jubilee leaders who pledged to work with Kenya Kwanza. This was not taken lightly by the Azimio team, who termed the leaders as traitors. Further, Shollei condemned the remarks made by Mumias East Peter Salasya directed to Bomet Woman Rep Linet Toto on Sunday. She said the country was headed in the wrong direction if such remarks were not curbed. "We have come too far in the question of Gender Equality in this country, nobody should think we will fold our hands and let them reverse the gains we have made as women to be treated equally and with respect by all Kenyans including our esteemed leaders," she added.
