Tanzanian singer Harmonize says he is still attached to his ex-lover's tattoo on his leg even after they broke up. Harmonize has tattooed his ex-girlfriend Frida Kajala's and her daughter's faces on his leg. He told Mungai Eve that tattoo is a personal thing. "It is not something you can talk about. Mwangalie tu kuona kama itakuwepo ama haitakuwepo," he said. He got a throwback photo of Kajala and her daughter Paula and tattooed it on his legs after she forgave him. The tattoo was alongside neatly calligraphed words that read, "I am sorry." Before she forgave him, Kajala covered the tattoo she had on her neck that constantly reminded her of her ex-boyfriend, Harmonize. At the time, Harmonize had the initial tattoo 'K' covered up.
