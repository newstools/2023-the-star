Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has eulogised the late Education CS George Magoha as an academic giant. Mudavadi said Magoha was a colossus in space and he took up his role with a lot of gusto. “We have come to condole with the family because this is a big loss. They have lost two people in a very short period,” he said on Monday. “Magoha was very resolute if he believed that what he was doing was right. He would pursue it with a lot of passion and enthusiasm.” Mudavadi said Kenya needed more men and women who can pursue education matters for our country with the same kind of energy Magoha did. “We pray that God gives us more men and women who can pursue education matters for our country with the same kind of energy Prof Magoha did,” he said. “Education is the foundation of any nation and when you have people who can pursue education matters with zeal, it is good for our country and children.” Magoha will be buried on February 11 in Umiru, Nyamininia subcounty. He died on January 24 at the Nairobi Hospital. He was 71 years old. Former Basic Education PS Julius Jwan, who is leading the team making funeral arrangements, announced that a farewell caravan will be held in Nairobi on February 8 to honour the late Magoha.
