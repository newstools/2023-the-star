Police have arrested a suspected fraudster in Kisumu. County police commander Alphonse Kimanthi said the suspect was arrested by officers from Kondele police station for forgery and obtaining money by false pretense. The suspect allegedly issued a matatu owner with a fake insurance certificate policy of Sh13,000. He said the matatu had been impounded by traffic police over a suspected sticker. This, Kimanthi said, prompted the matatu owner to visit the insurance company only to be told the sticker was fake. "The sticker was verified and confirmed that it was not authentic and did not originate from the insurance company," he said. The said suspect was pursued and arrested. He is being detained at the station and will be arraigned before the court on Monday.
