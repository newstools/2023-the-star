The second Athletics Kenya track and field meeting slated for Friday at the Nyayo Stadium will be part of the World Athletics Competition rankings. This means results from the competition, which now features on World Athletics Global Calendar, can be used by World Athletics for statistical purposes such as entry standards, world ranking, top list, records and more. In a statement, the federation said: "It is also an opportunity for the athletes who are not in the Athletes Integrity Unit/Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya testing pool to be identified and tested ahead of the trials for the global event." The two-day event will also double up as trials for the Under-18/ Under-20 team for the East African Athletics Regional Championships to be staged at the Benjamin William Kappa Stadium in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on March  10–11. The AK panel of selectors will be targeting 31 Under-18/ Under-20 athletes. Among the junior athletes who put in strong performances in the first leg and are probable to make the national team for the regional championships are Kenya Primary Schools Games 100m record holder Selpha Ajiambo, Nyanchoka Machoka of St Peter’s Keberesi and Nelly Chepchirchir, the winner of the 1,500m race during the Kisumu meet. The senior event will feature 20 race categories including 100m, 110 hurdles, 200m , 400m 400m/hurdles , 800m, 1500m, 3000m SC, 5000m, 10,000m 4x 100m and 4x 400m relays. The field events will include the long jump, high jump, triple jump, shot put, discus, hammer and javelin. AK said they expect a big turnout based on last year's event, which attracted 457 entries in 100m and 200m with long distance events like 10,000m and 5,000m having over three heats with maximum numbers required. "We encourage athletes to participate in the event as it gives an opportunity to qualify for major event or improve athlete’s world ranking," concluded the statement.
