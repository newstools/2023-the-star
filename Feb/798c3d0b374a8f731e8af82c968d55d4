Strathmore Leos have been handed a lifeline after after the Kenya Rugby Union Appeal Council quashed the walkover decision handed to rivals Blak Blad. The two sides will now play at a date to be decided by the KRU League and Fixtures Committee. Strathmore Leos had appealed the walkover decision after accusing Kenyatta University’s Blak Blad of engaging in politics when they refused to play the rescheduled league game on January 28. The decision by the Appeal Council read:“It is our unanimous finding that there was an agreement to have the game postponed and that Leos were entitled to have legitimate expectations that in dealing with the Kenyatta University Sports Director, they had no reason to doubt her apparent and ostensible authority to represent Blak Blad on the matter.” It further added: “On this issue, we reiterate the findings above that the agreement to postpone was valid. It therefore, follows that the reasoning of the League and Fixture Committee that the correspondence was null and void since the appellants communicated with Dr Giuditta and not the club’s official is untenable." "The L&FC did not call the parties to give submissions and what is apparent is that the appellant was condemned unheard which is contrary to the universal right to a fair hearing that is not only captured under Art 47 of the Constitution of Kenya but also enshrined under the provisions of the Fair 13 Administrative Action Act and the World Rugby Statues,” the statement concluded. Leos coach Louis Kisia welcomed the decision, saying: "We welcome the decision because we are not teams to give walkovers. We want to play each and every game and we look forward to playing Blak Blad. Initially, Blad were set to play Leos back on December 17, 2022 but Leos sought for the match to be postponed at the time, owing to their involvement in the Eastern Africa University Games in Uganda. The Madaraka-based are currently seventh on the log with 20 points with Blak Blad above them on 22.
