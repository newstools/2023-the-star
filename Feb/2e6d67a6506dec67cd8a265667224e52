A girl from Kisumu has appealed to well-wishers to help her join Form One at Tigoi Girls High School, Vihiga county. Lynne Whitney Anyango, 14, who scored 368 marks, risks losing the slot at the school due to a lack of school fees. She sat her KCPE exam at MM Shah Primary School, Kisumu Central subcounty. Whitney called for support from anybody to help realise her education dream. “My mother has been struggling to raise the fees but in vain. I have not even bought the entire boarding requirement due to lack of money,” she said. Whitney said she requires more than 15,000 for shopping. Her mother Magdalene Anyango has only managed to raise Sh12,000 in school fees against the expected more than 20,000 for term one. Of the Sh12,000, she raised Sh7,000 while Sh 5,000 was from the Kisumu county government bursary. Anyango, a single mother, who hawks watermelon and pineapple in Kisumu city, said they also need Sh17,500 for uniform. “My daughter was required to report on Monday but we could not because we lack money to buy boarding equipment and uniform as well as fees,” she said. Anyango hopes that her only child will secure support towards education, which they believe will transform and determine her future.
