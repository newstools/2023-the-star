Sixteen people from Maseki village in Kitui county were on Saturday admitted at Kyuso level IV hospital with suspected cholera symptoms. The patients were rushed to the hospital after complaining of stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhoea and high fever. Kitui health authorities have said it was too early to infer that those admitted could be suffering from cholera. Most of those admitted are learners from Maseki Primary School. County acting director of medical services, Dr Allan Owino, told the Star on the phone that samples had to be analysed first to establish whether it was cholera or another disease. “I don't have enough information about the admitted cases. I will update you later as soon as I get adequate information from there,” Owino said on Sunday. A source from Maseki village said that the affected persons fell sick after sharing a raw traditional meal prepared from grounded milling known locally as mbithi. In early January Kitui health authorities confirmed the outbreak of cholera in Kalulu village in Kyuso. The outbreak claimed two children. Kyuso subcounty medical officer of Health Dr Stephen Kioli told the Star then that the disease had affected a family of a Kavonokya sect member who don't believe in contemporary medicine nor do they visit hospitals when sick.
