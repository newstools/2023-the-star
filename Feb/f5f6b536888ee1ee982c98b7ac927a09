Zetech University Titans coach Job Munene is convinced his charges can avoid relegation if they remain focused in their remaining Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) matches. The varsity lads, who are playing in the top tier for the first time after debuting this season, have won only two of their 15 matches and remain rooted at the base of the 12- team table with 17 points. But having posted a hard fought but deserved 62-58 win over rivals University of Nairobi 'Terrorists' over the weekend, Munene said Titans will fire from all cylinders. “It was a good win for us and we must build on it,” said Munene adding, “It came at a good time as it gave us confidence and removed the element of self doubt from our minds.” “My responsibility now is to keep on encouraging them that they can still make it and all they need to do is to continue to work hard and correct our mistakes to achieve that goal.” Munene said in order to avoid the big drop, Zetech University besides preparing well, they must also shoot the ball well and tighten the defence that is always up at half time in all their games. “Our defence has gotten a bit better than it was in our previous matches, but our shot selection is not good at all,” he observed. The team still has some tight matches before completing their schedule which includes confrontations against three of the top five in Strathmore University Blades, Ulinzi Warriors and Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). “They are a young team with the oldest player being only 20 years. They will be around for some time and what they need to do is to work hard and keep learning,” he said. To escape the axe, Titans must do enough to upstage Terrorists (19 points), Kenyatta University “Pirates” (20), Umoja (21) and Lakeside (21). The reality will down on Titans this weekend they face off against Blades who are third with 30 points same as leaders Dumas and Warriors.
