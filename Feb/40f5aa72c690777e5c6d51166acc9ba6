The Kenya Defence Forces are warning Kenyans about falling prey to fake recruitment adverts across social media. They issued a notice to Kenyans on Twitter, asking them not to fall for the advances of conmen. They said that in the event that they are to carry out recruitment, they will only advertise on trusted newspapers and channels. "KDF recruitment will be advertised in the credible local dailies and on www.mod.go.ke," they said. They also cautioned Kenyans about accepting calling letters that purport to be from KDF, through the Ministry of Defence. The Kenya Defence Forces have not released any calling letters to the Forces. Kenyans are to be weary of such tactics, especially those that seem to want to extort money from them in the name of recruitment. This has become a common way for fraudsters to target unsuspecting and desperate Kenyans. In April 2022, an imposter was charged with conning a man Sh470,000 with the promise of securing a job in the military for her daughter. Mark Njihia was accused of obtaining the money from Francis Kimani by false pretenses on diverse dates between November 11 and 19 last year. Njihia was charged with using an identity card belonging to another person and he is accused of using the person’s ID card to register a SIM card for a mobile phone with Safaricom Limited without the owner’s permission. He was accused of having used the number to allegedly defraud other members of the public.
