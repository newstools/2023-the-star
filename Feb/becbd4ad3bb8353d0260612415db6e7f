Education CS Ezekiel Machogu on Saturday disclosed that the late George Magoha’s sister will be given a state job. This was in honour of the late Magoha’s wish. Machogu however did not disclose the name of the sister or the kind of job she will be getting in President Ruto’s administration. Addressing mourners at Magoha's burial ceremony at Odera Akang'o Campus, the CS revealed that his late counterpart had approached him with the request to have his sister considered for a job in government; a request he has since fulfilled. “Magoha when alive made one request to me saying he has a sister that he wanted the government to consider for something,” he said. “I want to inform you the people of Gem that when I discussed with his Excellency the President he agreed to Magoha's request and that sister is going to work in the government.” Machogu eulogized his predecessor as a selfless man who had a purpose in life. He remembered Magoha as a distinguished medic and scholar of his class who served the country with distinction. “He was a man who has left footprints in the ministry of education and other areas in this country that can never be erased,” Machogu said. Machogu thanked Maseno University for having given Magoha a chance as a lecturer, a position he said would have allowed him to teach and conduct his scholarly research.
