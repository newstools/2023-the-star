Having meat on your everyday meal plan can be costly in this economy. But that does not mean you cannot enjoy a nice home-cooked meal without breaking a leg. Matoke is a dish you love or you know someone who loves them. It can be cooked in several ways. However, fried matoke can be very tasty. Ingredients Green bananas from the market Onions Vegetable oil Dhania (Corriander) Potatoes (Optional) Salt Royco cubes (optional) Curry powder or beef masala Tomatoes – 2 or 4 Bell peper (pili pili hoho ) – optional Cayenne or chilli ( if you love your food spicy ) Preparation Step 1 Peel your green bananas, and potatoes. Cut each green banana into two halves. For the potatoes, cut them into 4 pieces each. Wash your bananas, and potatoes and bring them to boil with water. They should be cooked just enough.
