The Opposition coalition, Azimio la Umoja on Thursday announced dates for their next two rallies. Minority leader Opiyo Wandayi said the rallies dubbed 'People's Baraza' will resume on February 5, (Sunday). Wandayi said the Sunday rally will be held at the Kamukunji grounds in Kibra. "We wish to inform our supporters, the general public and all Kenyans who feel for our country that our People’s Baraza are set to continue this week and the weeks that follow. "On Sunday, 5th February 2023, we will hold a BARAZA at the Kamukunji grounds in Kibra Constituency. This will be followed by another Baraza on Friday, 10th February 2023, this time in Mavoko, Machakos County," he said. He appealed to members of the public to attend the barazas and deliberate on the critical challenges facing the country. Part of what will be discussed will include the high cost of living and the IEBC. He said the deliberations on recent developments relating to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will help fix the future of Kenya, before it is too late. "The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is down and out, destroyed by Wafula Chebukati. But the government wants to populate it with more Wafula Chebukatis of its own choice." "Kenyans will recall that our electoral body has taken this country to war in the past. We survived by a whisker. The IEBC, with the support of the UDA regime, is keen to take us to war again. We have to find a way of stopping them," Wandayi added. This will be the third and fourth opposition rallies in the country, since the August 9 2022 general elections. During the Kamukunji rally on Sunday, Raila announced that there will be a series of anti-government rallies that will move to Machakos, Nakuru, Kakamega, Kisii, Kisumu and Mombasa to pile pressure on Ruto. Raila will then head to Kiambu, Garissa, Isiolo, Turkana and then climax with the mega rally in Nairobi.
