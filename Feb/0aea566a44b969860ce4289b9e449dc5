Kenya Revenue Authority Commissioner General Githii Mburu has resigned. Board Chairperson Anthony Mwaura communicated the decision in aÂ  press statement on Thursday saying Mburu had handed in his resignation letter to pursue other personal interests. "Following the resignation, the board has appointed FCCA, CS Rispah Simiyu, Advocate EBS, to be the Acting Commissioner General KRA with effect from 23rd February, 2023 until the position is substantively and competitively filled," Mwaura said. Mburu was appointed KRA commissioner general on June 6, 2019. He was plucked from the intelligence wing of the authority at Times Tower to take up the critical post from John Njiraini who had left office at the end of his tenure. Njiraini had served on the role since March 2012.
