Actress Nini Wacera is worried about a lump in her breast. The talented actress said in an interview with Engage Talk that she discovered the lump in August last year. "I was home in Elementaita in a celebratory mood. I had gone to pick up my passport so I could travel to Zambia to scoop the Zikomo award for best supporting actress in Africa." This was for her role in the Kenyan Netflix series 'Country Queen'. She described the anger, fear and despair she went through since the discovery, revealing that her daughter was top on her mind. Nini blamed her health crisis on a former smoking habit she picked up in university, lack of exercise and bad eating habits. "Smoking was glamorous those days," she said. Nini said that blame caused emotional destruction. "It must be because you closed your heart to love. My multiple attempts at relationships had failed, and I learned the hard way." Nini was at the time living in Lagos, shooting a reality series, when she got the news her then-boyfriend was cheating on her. He had moved on 10 days after she relocated. Her daughter in Nairobi, Justine, wanted to find out if she and her boyfriend Toby had broken up because he and the art director were getting it on on set. After Toby, she decided to stay a single woman and a single mum. "I erased all notion of romantic love from my life and put up a notice, closed for life." She also blamed her lump on the grudge she had been holding against her dad. He was against her doing arts, urging her to pursue business instead. She joined a singing group. Her dad's dismay came when she performed in night clubs, where one day she met a sponsor, Simon, who swept her off her feet and impregnated her in less than two months. Nini admitted that she has mixed emotions about theÂ lump. "It is probably the biggest ugly amid this good. Will I be okay? I don't know. All I can do is hope for the best and heal," she said.
