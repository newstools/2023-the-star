Chief Justice Martha Koome on Friday presided over the swearing-in of Jane Chege into the National Taskforce on police reforms. Chege will represent the Public Service Commission in the National Taskforce on Improvement of the Terms and Conditions of Service and other Reforms for Members of the National Police Service and Kenya Prisons Service. The work of the Task Force is to catalyse effective service delivery by these two institutions that are crucial for the enforcement of law and security within our country. Koome said that the criminal justice system cannot function effectively when the police service and prison service are not motivated and enabled with a conducive environment to discharge their mandate.
