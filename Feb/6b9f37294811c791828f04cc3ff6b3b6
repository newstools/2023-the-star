Lawyer Danstan Omari has alleged that President William Ruto wants to take his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta to court over tax evasion. Speaking during an interview with NTV, Omari said Ruto should emulate the late President Mwai Kibaki who did not interfere with his predecessor Daniel Moi. "I think Kenya Kwanza is sleeping on the volcano they have raised, the volcano is going to eat them very hard, without knowing where they are coming from," he said. Omari said the impact of interfering with the former President will be felt globally. He said Ruto's administration should withdraw from anything that touches on the former president. "Uhuru and Raila are two serious international figures, they control 80 per cent of networks globally, and they are well-known individuals," he said. Omari was reacting to Ruto's Monday remarks that some people who were in power used state instruments to avoid paying taxes. President Ruto spoke on the same day four citizens sent a petition to Parliament seeking to repeal the provision that exempts the Kenyatta and Moi families from paying estate duty levy. "The good people who were used to exempting themselves from paying tax, their days are up," Ruto said at a conference in Mombasa. "Every citizen must pay tax. It doesn’t matter even if they sponsor demonstrations so that they don’t pay tax. I promise them they will pay tax. There is no more exemption.”
