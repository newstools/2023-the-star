It is only with the blessings of former President Uhuru Kenyatta that the leadership at Jubilee Party can change hands, political analyst Herman Manyora has opined. Speaking on Friday, Manyora said if Jubilee joins Kenya Kwanza then it is with Uhuru's blessing. "Jubilee cannot be snatched from Uhuru. No one can believe that," he said. However, Manyora questioned some of the Jubilee party members dalliances with the government, claiming that Uhuru may be exposed for not fully supporting ODM leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid on August 9. "These games of Uhuru seem to be coming to the surface. At the end of the day, it is doubtful that he supported Raila," he said. "With these kinds of games, it is becoming difficult to believe that Uhuru did not play Raila." This comes as some Jubilee officials led by the party's acting secretary general and Eala MP Kanini Kega pledge allegiance to President William Ruto and expressed their wish to be part of the Kenya Kwanza coalition. A faction of Jubilee members led by embattled party secretary Jeremiah Kioni have since moved to court to fight the takeover. Kioni and suspended party vice chairman David Murathe on Thursday secured orders from the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal barring the Registrar of political parties from effecting their expulsion.
