The Sacco has also reported a 46 per cent growth in income based loans compared to investment based loans, Sacco chairman Kennedy Keya said, with growth performance standing at 20 per cent.

The chairman spoke during the 45th Annual Delegates meeting held on Friday in Kisumu. “To sustain this steady growth of our loan disbursement, the board will continuously keep on reviewing the credit products features to ensure they meet the members’ needs in the current economic environment,” Keya said. The overall loan portfolio increased to Sh9.12 billion from Sh7.44 billion in 2021, translating to a 22 per cent (Sh 1.67 billion) growth. The chairman attributed this to increase in loan uptake following the review of the credit products features.

The overall IG Sacco income increased to Sh1.86 billion in 2022 compared to Sh1.71 billion in 2021. IG Sacco assets base has continuously grown over the past years arising from the continuous contribution by members towards share capital, and other monthly subscriptions to non-withdrawable deposits. During the period under review , the sacco reported an improved share capital by 15 per cent, thus Sh1.3 billion in 2022 from Sh1.1 billion in 2021.
