ODM rebel leaders on Saturday skipped the Kisumu Azimio rally held at Moi stadium. The leaders became the target of stinging criticism from their colleagues who called for stern actions against them. Former Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya asked Azimio leader Raila Odinga to allow him to start the process of kicking the rebels out of the party. "I want to ask our party leader to let me kick these MPs out of ODM," he said. Speaking during the Kisumu rally, the former Kakamega governor said the process needs to start so that the voters from the affected constituencies can elect loyal leaders to parliament. "We can't have them with us now. We remember how they would visit your home all the time while seeking the party's ticket," Oparanya said. ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna said the traitors must go. He singled out Kisumu senator Tom Ojienda who was Conspicuously absent from the meeting. " We asked the senator to explain what took him to the State House and he responded that you are the ones who sent him to look for development," Sifuna said. Kisumu governor Anyan'g Nyong'o who also waded into the debate said those who betrayed Raila won't succeed. "Rushing to state house won't be helpful to you. That path won't take you anywhere," he said. Siaya governor and his Homa Bay counterpart Gladys Wanga said leaders who are traitors of the Luo community won't be entertained. "If you see them, chase them out of town. We don't want to give governor Oparanya hard time dealing with the renegade," Orengo said. The ODM rebel MPs stared at the possibility of being ejected from the party for meeting President William Ruto. The legislators have since been christened as traitors after they met and pledged support to President William Ruto. In their defense, the defiant MPs insisted that they met the Head of State to discuss development. They claimed that their visit was a follow-up of the promises the president made during his whirlwind tour of the Luo-Nyanza region.
