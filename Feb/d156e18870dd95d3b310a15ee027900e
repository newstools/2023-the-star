President William Ruto on Wednesday flew out to Mogadishu where he attended a summit with other regional presidents on the stabilisation of Somalia. Ruto joined presidents Hassan Mohamud (Somalia), Ismail Omar Guelleh (Djibouti) and Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The Somalia Frontline States Summit is aimed at focusing regional efforts towards the stabilisation of Somalia and the eradication of terrorism in the area. Working towards the same goal, Ruto said the countries have the power to secure the peopleâ€™s well-being and fulfil their aspirations while diminishing terrorism. "We must disrupt the financial infrastructures, and weapons supply chains and sanction the enablers of terrorism in the Horn of Africa," he said. The Head of State added that the collective effort in anti-terrorism proves that peace is within reach.
