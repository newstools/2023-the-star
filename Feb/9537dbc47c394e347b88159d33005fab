Over 300 swimmers have confirmed participation in the Level Two swimming competition at the Makini School, starting this Friday. Nairobi County Aquatic Association secretary general, Kenneth Karani, said the event will be used to pick a team to represent the city in the Summer Sizzler Swimming Championships set for  June in Abu Dhabi, UAE. “We are looking at selecting 50 swimmers and we hope to pick the best in what will be a competitive three-day event,” added Karani. Karani added that various swim clubs in the city and neighbouring counties have expressed interest in sending their swimmers to the championship. “Clubs like Otters and swimmers from Kajiado, Kiambu, and Nakuru are expected to send their swimmers for the championship,” added Karani. Once selected,  Karani said the swimmers will start preparing for the championship in March to give them a three-month window for preparation for the event “We will give them the best preparation for the event and three-month training preparation will be ideal for the championship,” added Karani. The selected team will also take part in warm-up events in April and May “There will be time to fine-tune their preps and give them the best opportunity," he added. This will be the second year the team is taking part in the Abu Dhabi event after finishing eighth overall last year. Karani is hoping for improved performances against swimmers from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, England, and the USA amongst others
