Shock and grief engulfed Simat village in Kapsaret sub-county, UasinGishu County after a police officer hanged himself over domestic squabbles. The deceased, Constable Kiplagat Koskei, attached to Eldoret Central police station is said to have committed suicide after finding out that his estranged wife was cheating on him. Eldoret West Police boss Edward Masibo who described the officer as disciplined and hardworking said the deceased has been having marital problems with his wife for a long time. "The officer had resorted to alcohol abuse after discovering that his wife had been unfaithful to him and it is unfortunate that we lost him through such circumstances," said Masibo. Speaking to the media in his office, Masibo called on people including police officers to learn to share their family problems and challenges in life with others so that they can be assisted instead of rushing to commit suicide. "Sometimes it is good to share one's problems with others so that you can be assisted instead of resorting to taking your own life," advised Masibo. He called on locals to learn to share their problems and challenges in life with others so that they can be assisted instead of rushing to commit suicide. According to the neighbours, the deceased has been accusing his wife of infidelity leading to a fight in the house on a daily basis. "The officer has been having a misunderstanding with his estranged wife for a long time leading to a fistfight which we had become used to as a normal family issue. But we did not know it will lead to the man committing suicide," said one of Nyumba Kumi members in the area who declined to be named. The police boss said the body of the officer was transported from the scene of a crime to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary.
