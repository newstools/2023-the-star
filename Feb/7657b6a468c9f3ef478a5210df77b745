Mercurial striker Enosh Ochieng was the toast of the day, scoring twice to lead Ulinzi Stars to a well-earned 2-0 victory over Nairobi City Stars at Kasarani Annex on Saturday. Ochieng seized on Boniface Muchiri's exquisite pass that was deftly placed behind the defense to break the scoreless tie in the 74th minute. A superb performance of pinpoint passing by the squad resulted in Ochieng scoring again four minutes later, this time nestling the ball into the bottom corner of the goal. The soldiers' convincing victory propelled them to the fifth-place finish in the Kenyan Premier League standings. City Stars are currently facing relegation in the danger zone as they sit in position 16 with a pitiful 10 points after suffering their 11th loss of the season in 17 games.
