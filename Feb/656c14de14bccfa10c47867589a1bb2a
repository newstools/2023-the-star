Today, February 4, marks three years since retired President Daniel Arap Moi died. He was 95 years old and longest-serving president having been in office for 24 years until 2002. Taking to her Twitter handle, Nominated Senator Abshiro Halake has celebrated the anniversary. "Three years ago today, those of us who knew and loved Baba Moi cried. Today, we think of him, pray for him and smile in gratitude and celebration of his remarkable life!" she said. Halake added that the best things in life are felt in the heart, and not necessarily seen or touched. "Those who touch our lives in a special way, stay in it forever!" she said. Halake, who is also the chairperson of the Centre for Multiparty Democracy (CMD-Kenya), is nominated under the KANU Party. The late president died on Tuesday, February 4,2020 after long-term health complications. Moi had been admitted and re-admitted four times at the Nairobi Hospital since October 2021. KANU chairman Gideon Moi, however, said Moi died peacefully at 5.20 am on the Tuesday. His critics saw him as an autocratic leader but his allies credited him for sustaining stability in Kenya. Moi in 2004 asked "those he had wronged" for forgiveness and forgave those who had wronged him.
