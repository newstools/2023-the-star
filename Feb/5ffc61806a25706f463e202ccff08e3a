Kisumu City is gearing up to host the first Athletics Kenya (AK) track and field weekend meeting on Friday and Saturday. AK Nyanza North regional chairman, Joseph Ochieng yesterday said a huge field of about 1, 000 athletes are expected at the two-day event starting Friday at Moi Stadium and Kisumu National Polytechnic. Track events will be held at Moi Stadium while field events will take place at Kisumu National Polytechnic, according to Ochieng. “We expect a star-studded field because most of the athletes are keen to represent the country at the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary in August. The event will serve as a build-up ahead of the national trials,” he noted. The World Championships are scheduled for August 19 to 27. Two weeks ago, AK organised season-opening sprints, middle distance, and field events build-up events at the Mumias Sports Complex in Kakamega county which attracted hundreds of athletes. “Being a low altitude area, we expect athletes to post fast times,” added the World Athletics race walking judge. He assured athletes and officials that the stadium is in perfect condition after the Kisumu county government relocated a market and a dumping site away from outside the stadium. “Since the conclusion of the KICOSCA games, we have been working on the track and I’m satisfied with its condition at the moment,” said Ochieng. He said officials who will officiate at the event have been undergoing a three-day intensive refresher course at the Kisumu Social Hall. After Kisumu, action heads to Nyayo National Stadium for the second-weekend meeting on February 24 and 25.
