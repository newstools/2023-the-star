Kisii School principal Fred Mogaka was on Wednesday elected as the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Kisii county chairman. Mogaka was elected unopposed during elections held at Kisii School and presided over by the county quality assurance and standards officer,  Joseph Ochieng. Geoffrey Nyantika was re-elected unopposed as the secretary while Madaraka Nyakweba of Enchoro Pefa retained the treasurer’s post. Amaiko Secondary School principal bagged the vice chairman’s post. Amaiko are the Kisii county girls' hockey champions. Christine Adipo of Ngenyi Girls is the new vice treasurer while Shem Nyamoringo was elected vice secretary. Football Kenya Federation Kenya Premier League referee Evans Ongaga retained his seat as a committee member. Other committee members are Alex Aika, Evans Siro, Lillian Ng’etich, and Evans Omache. Mogaka who is also a volleyball referee pledged that his team will restore Kisii’s lost glory in secondary school games. “We must regain our rightful space in the country's sports arena,” he added. He, however, sounded a warning to schools that are fond of fielding ineligible players during inter-school games. “The era of fielding non-students is over. Let us all identify and nurture genuine students,” said Mogaka. He said schools should identify one game and focus on it. “I’m happy with what St Peter’s Keberesi and Boruma are doing. They are our athletics powerhouses and academies,” said Mogaka. He said Nyantika will seek a seat at the regional level next week. The regional elections will be held in Kisumu on Tuesday. At the same time, Nyantika announced that Kisii will host the KSSSA Nyanza region Term One games. “I want to appeal to school coaches across the county to intensify training ahead of the regionals. We want a team from Kisii to represent us at nationals,” he said. Term One disciplines are basketball, hockey, rugby 7’s, swimming, handball, and athletics.
