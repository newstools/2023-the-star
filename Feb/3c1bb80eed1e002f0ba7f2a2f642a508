The chairperson of the National Parents Association Silas Obuhatsa has proposed the establishment of the National Education Foundation to offer financial support to needy learners in public schools. Obuhatsa said the NPA is seriously thinking of working with the Ministry of Education to establish the foundation. "School fees has been a major hindrance to many able but poor students from accessing and completing education in this country," he said. He said though the government and donors have tried to arrest the situation, they have not been as successful. The NPA chairperson said the foundation will work like the Equity Bank's Wings To Fly and Helb loan. "If this suggestion comes to reality, all scholarships from various corners including Wings To Fly, Helb, NG-CDF, donors and others will be put together through the foundation," he said. He said that the foundation will collect the funds, then send them out to all deserving students in a transparent and accountable manner. "The foundation will have branches at all subcounty levels to make it easier for students to access help without having to travel to Nairobi," He said. Obuhatsi said it will be upon the National Parents Association to strictly work with its grassroots offices to identify needy students. He said the foundation will work closely with the government, Parliament, county Assemblies, ministries willing to join and donors.
