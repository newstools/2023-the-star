Security officials in Kabondo Kasipul are hunting for suspects over the death of a Form 3 student in Kisumu county. Elvis Omondi, 19, died on Sunday morning as he was being rushed to the hospital. He was a student at Kowidi Mixed Secondary in Kabondo Kasipul. The deceased together with some friends went to a night disco at Kakolasiany village in the neighbouring Nyakach constituency. Elvis hails from the Kodhoch West location, Kabondo Kasipul constituency in Homa Bay county. Security officers said they have not yet established what triggered the confrontation between the boy and the suspects. According to the Kodhoch West location chief Charles Dete, the boy succumbed to injuries he sustained during the incident. The deceased had panga cuts on the head and stomach. His arms and back also had panga cuts. “The assailants carried and dumped an unconscious Elvis in Kabondo Kasipul before they ran away,” Dete said. He said some passers-by saw Elvis and attended to him before they took him to Ramula subcounty hospital for treatment. At the subcounty hospital, his condition worsened before medics referred him to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital for specialised medical care. He died on his way to the county referral hospital and now his mother Christine Okeyo asked the police to expedite investigations into the boy's death. “Medics tried to resuscitate my son without success. Elvis died before arriving at Homa Bay Referral,” she said. The body was moved to Okita mortuary in Kabondo Kasipul constituency. Subcounty police boss Justus Kucha said they are working closely with the family as they hunt for the suspects. He warned residents against attending disco matanga. “Disco matanga is illegal. We’re looking for the suspects to record statements over the death,” Kucha said.
