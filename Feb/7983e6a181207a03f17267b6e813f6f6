Athletics Kenya president Jackson Tuwei wants the people of the athletics rich North Rift region to claim ownership of the Sirikwa Classic World Athletics Tour even as preparations for this weekend’s edition hits top gear. While urging the locals and Kenyans in general to troop to the Lobo Village in Kapseret, Uasin Gishu County, Tuwei said the growth of the event will mean an opportunity for Kenya runners to win huge prize monies on home soil. “I would like to urge those from around here to come and support us. Come on your numbers and let us work together to make the Sirikwa Classic bigger and better because you never know. It might just become more international than it is now,” he said. “A lot of times when our athletes go to compete abroad, they are awarded cash prizes when they win. This time, we are giving them an opportunity to make that money here at home and stay with it. Many times, when they win abroad, a substantial part of their earnings is always subjected to income tax,” Tuwei noted. Meanwhile, Tuwei said Lobo Village, owned by renowned marathoner Ibrahim Hussein, is ready to welcome bigger numbers of spectators to surpass the estimated 7,000 who attended the first event last year. The event was then known as Memorial Agnes Tirop Cross Country Tour, in honour of the 2015 World Cross Country champion, who became the second-youngest winner of the senior women’s cross country title. “According to the reports that we have received, there were approximately 7,000 spectators at last year’s event. I am sure we will surpass that number and go beyond 10,000,” Tuwei said, adding that entrance to the one-day event, which will feature six categories of competition, will be free for all spectators. The Sirikwa Classic has thus far attracted hundreds of athletes from Kenya and other countries, such as Bahrain, Great Britain, Sweden, Slovenia, Estonia, Qatar and Ukraine.
