The Decimators have released a new album, Cocktail on the house #COTH. The 11-track album features Kenya’s top artists including Nyashinski, Trio Mio, Tosh Kiama, Ricco Beats, Kimbassax and P-Unit, who came together after a long hiatus to lend their creative input to the album. Decimators is a Kenyan artist collective comprising Eric Musyoka aka Msyox, Boniface Chege aka Bon'Eye, Noah Ng’ang’a aka Konkodi and Brian Mwangi aka Brian Nadra. The group said it took them three years to finish the album. "The love and effort that has gone into this project as a follow up to our last album is immense. We believe we have given our fans the best we can," they said. Bon'Eye recalls the recording sessions that happened in a wildlife ranch with an amazing view of Mt Kenya for inspiration, aptly titled 'Nanyuki Sessions' as one of the best moments in his recording career. Brian Nadra recalls the late-night writing sessions where he would spend the whole night just perfecting a line. "The team was super inspired. You can hear the results," he said. Despite all the late nights and years in the making, Konkodi has nothing but positive feelings about this masterpiece. "It’s a project that I have thoroughly enjoyed making and being a part of. And I am really content with what we have put out," Konkodi said. The group came together in 2017 as signed artists under Decimal Records, and they have evolved in various ways to become the musical force that they are today. Their debut album Decimators Vol 1 was released in 2018 and spawned the mega hits Drinx na Mayenx and Bonge. They have had other successful singles like Wamlambez, 2x2, Kahora, Lover and Kontrol, Siaya and Entanglement.
