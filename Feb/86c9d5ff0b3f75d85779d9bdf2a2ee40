South Coast Pirates coach Kevin Amiani is confident his side will cement their Kenya Rugby Union Championship slot when they face Impala on Saturday. “Our plan is to get five points against Impala to confirm our semifinal place. KRU Championship is a tough league, you lose one match, you are displaced from your position,” said Amiani. South Coast Pirates suffered a 22-17 loss against runaway leaders Nondescripts at Seacrest International School in Diani, Kwale County on Saturday. “It was a tough game. We were ahead until the last minute when Nondies were given a penalty try. It was a painful loss but we accept and focus on the next game,” added Amiani. Pirates are fourth on the log with 25 points while Impala, relegated from the Kenya Cup league last season, are fifth with 22. Pirates will conclude their regular season against second-placed Daystar University Falcons next week. Leaders Nondies will play relegation-threatened Zetech University’s Oaks as they seek to confirm their play-off place. Nondies are the only unbeaten team in the second-tier league so far and remains on course for a quick return to the Kenya Cup after one season in the Championship. Second-placed Daystar University Falcons will face Shamas Foundation. Third-placed Kisumu RFC will be away to bottom-of-the-log Eldoret as Kabarak University host the University of Eldoret in Nakuru. Western Bulls and United States International University Africa’s Marshals will clash at the Bull Ring in Kakamega County.
