Cash-strapped Football Kenya Federation Premier League side Vihiga Bullets have received a timely boost ahead of their weekend encounter against Ulinzi Stars after BetNare offered to meet their requirements for the game. BetNare have helped Vihiga Bullets, the home team, secure the match venue, Bukhungu Stadium. On Wednesday, Bullets were stranded at Nyayo Stadium after their 1-0 loss to AFC Leopards and had to seek bail-out from wellwishers to return to their western Kenya base. While well-wishers sent in donations which enabled them return home, coach George Owoko approached BetNare to help them honour this weekend's match, which the gaming company positively considered. “The team is really suffering. We have not had a sponsor since last year and the players, most of whom are breadwinners, are not able to meet their daily obligations,”said Owoko, whose team gave out a walkover against Sofapaka last weekend. “I really want to thank BetNare for this kind gesture of paying for the venue for our next match slated to take place this weekend at Bukhungu Stadium against Ulinzi Stars." Meanwhile, the two parties are currently in negotiations over a possible partnership in the future. Bullets are currently 17th on the KPL table.
