The General Service Unit will use this weekend's league matches and next month's East Africa Police Volleyball Championship in Rwanda as part of their build-up for the African Club Championship. The paramilitary side are the Kenya Volleyball Federation men's defending champions. GSU, coached by Gideon Tarus,  have won the past fourth consecutive titles. GSU face Prisons Rift Valley, Kenya Prisons and Trailblazers in the three-day energy-sapping second-leg duels starting Friday at the Nyayo stadium. The EAPC has not been held since 2019 due to Covid-19. The last event was held in Nairobi. "The two competitions will help fine-tune our preparations for the  Club championship. We want to win the second-leg matches this weekend. That will be a barometer to gauge the players in terms of fitness." "We also want to leave a mark in the regional tournament but the main focus will be the continental assignment," Tarus maintained. GSU have lost three key players namely; Simon Kosirai, Brian Melly and Abiud Chirchir but Tarus remains unfazed. The trio has been integral in GSU's success, thanks to their unmatched performance. Rivals consider GSU weak and have already ruled them out of title contention despite the 16-team league season still being in its infancy. Tarus, however, thinks otherwise. "I don't believe in hearsay. We've heard a lot about us but we will go on with our business as usual. We don't care what they say. If GSU are weak, then any other team has its weakness as well. Underrating us won't make us lose sleep. Prisons have lost Michael Chemos. Other teams have also lost their main players. For us, we will do our talking on the court." Improving on reception and blocks will go a long way in removing flaws in GSU's game, according to Tarus. "We are burning our midnight oil to polish our weaknesses. The likes of Dominic Chelule will only make us better."
