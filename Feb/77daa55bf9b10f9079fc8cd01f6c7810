Three-time national shot put champion Peter Mwangi says exposure is key if they are to post good results in field events. Mwangi said with a packed calendar this year, there is a need for the country to expose field athletes in a bid to diversify and increase medal chances at the international stage. He said it is time the government, through the Ministry of Sports, came to the aid of field athletes. "For us to feature at the World Championships in Budapest and even the 2024 Paris Olympics, we must be given build-up championships," said Mwangi, who won his specialty at the Athletics Kenya build-up meeting in kisumu over the weekend. “Yes, I won but I’m not happy with the results because 15.60m is not what I wanted. My target is 17m,” said Mwangi. He was followed by Kenya Defence Forces' Alex Wachira (14.61m) and Fredrick Chumba  (14.09m). In women's shot put, Nairobi-based Linda Kageha won the title with a throw of 12.82m ahead of KDF’s Sarah Atieno (12.50m) and Maurine Akisa (11.61m). Mwangi said authorities concerned are yet to make deliberate efforts to motivate and encourage field athletes like their track counterparts. “All we are asking for is exposure and with that, I am sure we can compete at the same level with our track counterparts," he said. Mwangi said he missed the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham by a small margin and believes things would have been different if they were given prior exposure. “Last year, I had 16.34m but the qualification for the Commonwealth Games was 16.80m.  See I missed by a small margin. If we can get exposure, we will do well," he added. “Personally, I can’t say I lack training facilities. I have my own equipment and I train under  Elizabeth Olaba. What I lack is exposure."
