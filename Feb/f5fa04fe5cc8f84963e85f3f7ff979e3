Dancer Moya David will sue anyone who copies his dance moves. Speaking to bloggers in a recent interview, the popular TikToker said he had patented the dance styles he uses to surprise his clients. David said for a while now, people have been misusing his talent and others copying it. "It's my creativity but people sometimes don't give me the recognition I deserve," he said. "Anyone who tries to imitate my style the law will take its course. I have patented all the dance styles that I do." The content creator also warned those who operate fake accounts on social media pretending to be him in order to lure and defraud Kenyans. A few days ago, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli also obtained a patent for the phrase, "alaa, alaa, alaa". A statement from the Kenya Intellectual Property Insitute seen by Word Is indicated that Atwoli has the exclusive right to the now famous phrase until 2031. KIPI, the agency mandated to regulate intellectual property rights, approved Atwoli's application dating 2021. Atwoli first uttered the popular phrase during an interview with Citizen TV'sJeff Koinange on the JKL show in May 2021. Later, in December 2021, the trade unionist declared his intention to pursue exclusive rights for the phrase.
