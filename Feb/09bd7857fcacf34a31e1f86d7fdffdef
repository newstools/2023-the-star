The funeral committee for the burial of the late former Education CS George Magoha will on Wednesday hold a procession in Nairobi. This is aimed at giving Kenyans an opportunity to pay their respects before the burial on Saturday. At 8:30 am on Wednesday, the farewell caravan will proceed from Lee Funeral Home to the Faculty of Health Sciences (FHS) University of Nairobi, Kenyatta National Hospital Campus. The caravan will enter the KNH Complex through KNH Gate, Hospital Road and exit through the KMTC Gate, Ngong Road. The funeral committee leader former Basic Education PS Julius Jwan said the staff and students of FHS, KNH and KMTC are free to pay their last respects. "Attendees are encouraged to put on white coats and may lay flowers near the catafalque," Jwan said. At 11:30 am, Magoha's coffin will be taken in a procession to UoN Main Campus, Chancellor's Court (near CCU), through St. Paul's Chapel Gate. Jwan urged the academic staff to dress in academic gowns as they pay their last respects while the STEM students have their lab coats on and follow the procession from the Chapel gate. The caravan from UoN will exit through the Museum roundabout. Magoha's requiem mass will be held on Thursday at the Consolata Shrine, Westlands. On Saturday, the funeral mass will be held at Odera Akang'o University College Campus in Yala. "Academic staff in gowns may escort the body in a procession from his home in Umiru Nyamnina, Yala from exactly 8 am. Please keep time," Jwan said.
