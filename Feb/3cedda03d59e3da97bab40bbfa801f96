A company director accused of stealing Sh10 million by virtue of employment is wanted by the court after jumping bail. Milimani chief magistrate Susan Shitubi canceled Abdighani Abdirahman Abdi's cash bail after he failed to appear in court three times to attend to his case. Last month chief magistrate Wendy Micheni issued a warrant of arrest against the accused. The accused is said to have absconded court after being charged last year with theft and forgery. When the matter came up on February 3 for a mention, Abdighani was still missing in court neither was his lawyer present. This prompted the magistrate to cancel his bond terms and extended the arrest warrant against him. His Sh300,000 cash bail was forfeited to the state. The case will be mentioned on February 17. In court, the accused is charged that on November 3, 2021, and August 31, 2022, at Diamond Trust Bank Koinange branch in Nairobi, being a director of Sunspot Petroleum Limited stole Sh10,248,592, the property of Sunspot Petroleum which he took to his possession by virtue of his directorship.
