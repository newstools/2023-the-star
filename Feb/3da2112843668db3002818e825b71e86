Newly-elected Rift valley Primary Schools Sports Association chairman Peter Sang has reiterated the importance of nurturing talents within primary school going children. With top officials elected unopposed during the regional elections held on Friday at the Nakuru High school grounds, Sang said that primary schools are the establishing centres for talents that should be guarded with pride. “All top sportsmen and women across the world started from such areas, the primary schools. I want to urge all stakeholders to guard their talents well to secure their future,” said Sang. Chairman Sang, secretary Mamai Etiang and treasurer James Marite won their positions without facing any opposition ahead of the school games that start next month across the country.

As the chairman, I want to assure everybody that they have great servants,” said the Kipkures Primary School head teacher. Sang, from Nandi County, added: “We are the largest region in Kenya with 14 counties and I am happy that we conducted our elections in an open and democratic manner,” he said, adding that he will work with all stakeholders.
