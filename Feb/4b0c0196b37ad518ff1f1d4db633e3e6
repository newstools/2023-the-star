Rapper Nyashinski's wife Zia Bett has commenced her weight-loss journey months after welcoming their second child. She shared a video on Instagram coming from her morning runs as part of the Keto Challenge, a weight loss programme. Her target is to lose 8kg in two months. "So I've just come from my first run since I gave birth, and let me tell you, my knees gave in so quick, but I was like, I just have to start," she said. Nyashinski hinted at welcoming a son a month ago, when he said he was working hard for them. "I want to create a legacy my sons will be proud of." The couple have maintained a private life by not posting their two children online.
