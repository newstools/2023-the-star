Information and Technology Cabinet Secretary Eliud Owalo has defended the government's plans to generate digital identification for citizens, insisting the migration will be realised by next year. The CS, who spoke during a workshop in Mombasa on Thursday, said the digital identification for Kenyans will be anchored on the National Identity System by February 2024. "We are not carrying forward the baggage of Huduma Namba. Other countries have done it (digital identification) there is no reason why Kenya should be an exception," Owalo said. According to the CS, the need for a digital identity cannot be overemphasised as the government moves to know speedily and easily identify its citizens. "It does not make sense for Kenyans to visit government offices and start flashing out their identity cards. They can comfortably access services wherever they are (through digital identification)," the CS said. On the digitisation of government records, Owalo said the government, under the digital services pillar, will ensure all services are digitalised by June this year. Already plans are underway to ensure that 5,000 government services are aboard the e-citizen portal by June as the government leverages technology to expand its revenue tax base. The CS said the government is also seeking to ensure that all the land records are digitised to unlock the potential of Sh100 million in revenue from the land sector. Owalo said that birth registration and management of traffic on the roads are also some of the government services that will be digitised. "Information and Communication Technology is an enabler to other key areas in government. It is a driver with the potential to drive other sectors," he said.
