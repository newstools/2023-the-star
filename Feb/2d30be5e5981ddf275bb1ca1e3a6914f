Diary, In the new year, people promise to change their lives one way or another. There might be some things I could change about mine, but two things persist. For one, I’m yet to be convinced about the benefits of shackling for life (until divorce do us part). And I can’t thank the heavens enough that I am still a doctor this year, doing what I love. You know how they say do what you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life? They must have been talking about me. Today, an old lady came into my office with a small cut on her arm. I checked the clipboard. “Mrs Kimani, how are you today?” She smiled. “I don’t know about you, but I could do with another glass of muratina.” I checked the board again. “Says here you have a heart problem. You shouldn’t be drinking any kind of alcohol.” “And vehicles are still killing people, yet my grandson brought me here in one. You think I got to this age by listening to what people say?” “Okay, then, Mrs Kimani. What can I do for you today?” She began removing her sweater. Nothing unusual about that. What I came to realise was how slowly she was doing it, teasing the garment off her body, licking her lips while her eyes stayed locked to mine. I ignored her for a while. The sweater came off. When she began unbuttoning the short-sleeved blouse under the sweater, I stopped her. “Mrs Kimani, the nurse says you came in for a cut on your arm. No need to disrobe.” “You’re right.” She leaned closer. “You should do it. A man should lead.” “I can already see the cut. We can work on it as you are.” She pouted as she presented her injured limb and said coyly, “I’m sorry, it’s just that you remind me of my third husband.” “Third husband?” I asked. “How many have you had?” “Two.”
