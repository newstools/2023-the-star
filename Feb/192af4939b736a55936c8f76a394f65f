For those who had written-off Sir Ali Muslim Club as potential T20 League titlists it may be time to swallow their own words. Like Kanbis 'A', Sir Ali 'A' have won three out of three but it will be interesting to see just how the weekend pans out. Both Kanbis and Sir Ali have 12 points but are only separated by the all-important run rate, of which the former are superior on that front. Saturday has three Super Division matches on the cards with Swamibapa 'A' having been granted a bye. Leaders Kanbis 'A' will host Cutchi Leva 'A' at their Eastleigh High School backyard. Sir Ali 'A' will also be at home, against Obuya Academy 'A'. In Sunday’s highlight, Kanbis 'A' will play Stray Lions at Eastleigh High School grounds while Swami’s host Ruaraka 'A' at their Jaffreys backyard. Gymkhana have a bye on Sunday but are leaving nothing to chance in their bid to gain respectable position in the T20 League. Nairobi Gymkhana have a date with Sikh Union on their home turf on Saturday but have a bye the following day. Sunday will feature four Super Division matches. Gymkhana skipper Harshvardhan Patel said: "It has not been a great start to the season thus far. Not that we are not playing well, just being a bit sloppy in critical moments of the game. We are treating Saturday’s match as a final.” “It’s a must win game for us in order to have a chance to finish in the top four. I’ve given all my players the freedom to go out and express themselves and to just execute our plans.” Division One and Two will also feature several matches at various venues. On Saturday, hosts Ruaraka 'B' will face Cutchi Leva 'B' while Swamipaba 'B' will play Stray Lions 'B'. Wolves 'B' and Kanbis Development will play in a Group 'A' Division One encounter at Lenana from 2:30pm on Saturday. Kongonis 'B' will square it out with Stray Cheetah at Nairobi Club.
