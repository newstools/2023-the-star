Having been run in Naivasha over the past few editions, the Kenyan round of the FIA African Rally Championship (ARC) will now be run in Voi on March 18-19. Kenya’s rally driver Issa Amwari welcomed the decision to run the event in Voi adding that the change of venue will add some zest and anticipation. “Voi will be a good change of scenario as we have been to Naivasha for a while now. I am looking forward to the new location of the event where we will face a fresh challenge. It’s always very exciting to face fresh challenges,” said Amwari, who will drive a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X. Notable absentees this year will be Zambia’s reigning African Rally champion Leroy Gomes and his wife Urshla Gomes who are skipping the season to concentrate on work. Gomes, in a text message, said: “We have not planned to take part in any events for the season. I have to commit myself to work.” Clerk of the course Gurvir Bhabra revealed that the ARC Equator Rally will be run in compliance with the FIA International Sporting Code (ISC). “The National Road Traffic Regulations shall also apply,” Gurvir noted, adding: “Any modifications, amendments, and/or additions to the rules and regulations shall be made in the form of numbered and dated bulletins.” Equator rally will be preceded by the season-opening Rallye Bandama of Côte d’Ivoire on the weekend of February 25-26 and will be flagged off at the Voi Wildlife Lodge before proceeding to stages in the expansive Taita Sisal estates in Mwatate where private ranch closed roads will be used. A total of 1o stages will be run during the event. The opening day on March 18 will feature a competitive distance of 159.66km and eight special stages with the following day (March 19) featuring a competitive mileage of 45.59km with two special stages. The podium ceremony will run from 12:30hrs on the final day with prize giving ceremony set for 3 pm at the Voi Wildlife Lodge. The event will also count towards the second round of the Kenya National rally Championship (KNRC).
