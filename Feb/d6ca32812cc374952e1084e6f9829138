Proceedings of the Senate have resumed after more than 20 minutes break following protests by minority leaders Deputy Speaker Kathure Murungi had suspended the session following chaos by the Azimio lawmakers to force the speaker to enforce changes to their leadership. The Azimio coalition is seeking to remove Isiolo senator Fatuma Dullo as Senate minority whip but the speaker has declined to effect the changes due to a court order. Prior to the suspension of the proceedings, the Deputy Speaker suspended four senators; Minority leader Stewart Madzayo, his Deputy Enoch Wambua, Ledama Ole Kina (Narok) and Eddie Oketch (Migori). However, on resumption of the business, the senators struck a reconciliatory tone with lawmakers from both sides of the floor pleading with the Deputy Speaker to reverse his decision to suspend the four leaders. "I want to plead with you Mr Speaker because there is a broader conversation that will take place, that the four colleagues that you had requested to leave the chamber, I personally plead on their behalf that you let that matter rest," Majority Leader Aaron Cheruiyot said. Cheruiyot disclosed that they have planned a meeting of the minority and majority leadership on Thursday to resolve the problem. Nyamira Senator Okong'o Omogeni also pleaded with the Deputy Speaker to set aside his ruling. "We are all human beings. Once in a while, we make mistakes. But every day we commence our proceedings with prayer and we know that it is biblical to forgive," Omogeni said.
