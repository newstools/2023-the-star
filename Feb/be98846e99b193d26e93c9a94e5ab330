Safarilink has explained why they charged Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o Sh19,000 for a flight from Nairobi to Kisumu. This is after Nyong'o decried high flight charges by the airline. In a statement on Thursday, Nyong'o said that he had booked a flight to Kisumu where he was charged Sh19,000 instead of Sh5,000. "I am issuing this statement to protest the excessively high flight charges of domestic airlines. On February 3, I was booked to fly to Kisumu from Wilson Airport,  Nairobi on Safarilink Airline's 7 am flight No.08. Ticket Reference number 49141F." "I called my secretary to confirm the flight. She told me all was well except that Safarilink was asking for Sh19,000 for one way flight from Nairobi to Kisumu," he said. Nyong'o said that he called the manager to protest but since he was headed for an urgent meeting, he paid Sh19,000. The governor further said that he had asked his staff not to use the airline henceforth. However, Safarilink responded to the allegations saying the airline's prices are based on demand, peak travel days and time of booking. "Our fares to Kisumu are in the price range from Sh5,500 to Sh19,000 so the earlier one books the cheaper the fare. In this instance, you booked this flight directly from our website the evening before the flight and hence the fare was based on the last seat available," the statement read. Safarilink said they expect returns after having to navigate through a difficult three years during Covid with no concessions or support from the government. "Private airlines have to contend with multiple taxes and levies such as VAT on fuel, RDL on expensive spare parts, Vat on engine overhauls, and the sliding Kenya shilling On the same day. Other airlines who are beneficiaries of government support, had higher fares, so it is surprising that it is only Safarilink that has been cited with what you term as "ripping off gullible passengers." Safarilink said they are ready to support Kisumu county with regular flights.
