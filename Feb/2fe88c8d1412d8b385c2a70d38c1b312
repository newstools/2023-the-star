Industry, Trade and Investment CS Moses Kuria has responded to lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi over his remarks on the closure of China Square, a move the CS has been pushing. In his response, Kuria said that Kenya was only open for business, and nothing more. "Kenya is open for business but Kenya is not open for dumping @ahmednasirlaw," he said on Sunday. The lawyer had earlier on called out Kuria for fighting a succeeding business just because it is owned by a Chinese national. Ahmednasir insisted that Kuria is wrong and that Kenya policies should not have racist undertones. "Our policies should not have "a racist" undertone. CS Moses Kuria is obviously wrong in his onslaught against Mr. Lei Cheng of China Square. "Kenya is open for business" is Kuria's mantra, yet he is at war with Cheng for succeeding in his business model (selling cheapest)," he tweeted on Sunday. The business entity (China Square) has been the talk of the town after reports went rife that it was selling commodities at cheaper and affordable rates. The reports saw hundreds of Kenyans troop to Unicity mall owned by Kenyatta university to have an experience of China Square, a move that Kenyan traders felt will elbow them out of business. On Friday, Trade CS Moses Kuria said that as much as Kenya welcomes Chinese investors, they were here as manufacturers and not traders. He said he had held talks with the Kenyatta University Vice Chancellor Prof Paul Wainaina on the shop's lease. "I have today given an offer to Prof Wainaina the VC Kenyatta University to buy out the lease for China Square, Unicity Mall and hand it over to the Gikomba, Nyamakima, Muthurwa and Eastleigh Traders Association," he said. Following his remarks, the store announced on Sunday that it has indefinitely suspended its operations. "We, China Square Limited, regret to inform you that we will continue to close down for further notice," the statement read in part.
