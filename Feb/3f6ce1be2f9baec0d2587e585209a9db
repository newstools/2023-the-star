Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi was on Saturday compelled to clarify why he showed up at the Azimio after his presence raised eyebrows. The event was at Esiandumba grounds during the homecoming party of Luanda MP Dick Maungu. After being handed the microphone, Kagesi set the record straight saying he was there courtesy of his blood relations with the host MP. "Honourable Dick Maungu is my cousin, his mother comes from Vihiga where I come from, so I came in to attend his homecoming event as a cousin," Kagesi said. Kagesi is a member of the Amani National Congress (ANC) party, an affiliate member of the ruling Kenya Kwanza coalition. He defended his seat on the Musalia Mudavadi-led party ticket for a second consecutive term at the August 9 elections. "So while here at function, I have been given the mandate to go back and inform the government that CBC is a problem to our people and the high cost of living I will deliver that report," the lawmaker said. The MP was reacting to sentiments that were raised by leaders present in the function. "Sasa Mimi nimetumwa tu sasa nitafikisha number huko," Kagesi saidÂ  before handing the microphone back to the programme moderator. Azimio leaders led by Raila Odinga used the occasion to castigate the Kenya Kwanza administration over the high cost of living.
