You are likely to dig deeper into your pocket to pay your electricity bills. This is after the government confirmed that power bills will go up due to the continued decrease in the water levels at the Masinga dam. The dam is the largest electricity generation reservoir in the country but currently has five per cent water levels, a situation that has been associated with the ongoing drought. Energy and Petroleum CS Davis Chirchir however said the change might not be much as the government has put in place measures to arrest the situation. The CS spoke when he toured the dam on Friday, accompanied by the PS Alex Wachira. “As we are all aware for the last five years we have had a serious failure in the rains and you will appreciate when you see the water levels that we have a challenge,” Chirchir said. “The only challenge is we might get power being slightly expensive because we are ramping the diesel generation more than we ordinary should be doing.” According to the CS, low levels at the Masinga dam might force the engineers to close it and push all the water down to the cascades to support the generation downstream. He has however said the country is banking on the current weather to generate more power from the solar, as the experts await the next situational report in the next 15 days. He said unlike other countries like Uganda and Zambia which are significantly hydro-dependent, Kenya has diversified and majorly relies on geothermal with just 30 per cent being hydro. “Let’s manage the hydrology, let's dispatch the hydro when we must and continue to ramp up the geothermal and push the wind generation,” the CS said. This comes even as the Kenya Association of Manufacturers expressed concern over the proposal by Kenya Power to increase electricity tariffs from April 1. The association in a statement on Wednesday vowed to engage the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority on the way forward and advocate for a reduction in the cost of power. KAM chairman Rajan Shah said the increment shall see manufacturers’ cost of electricity increase by between Sh3.5 and Sh5 per unit, translating to a 38 per cent cost increase, depending on their respective tariff and consumption levels.
