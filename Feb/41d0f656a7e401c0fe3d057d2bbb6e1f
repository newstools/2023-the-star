LakeHub and German Development Cooperation have launched a Sh30 million empowerment programme for youth and women in agribusiness in Western Kenya. Eligible youth and women-led agribusiness enterprises in poultry, groundnuts, passion fruits and apiculture value chains from Bungoma, Kisumu, Siaya, Kakamega and Vihiga counties have been invited to take part in the programme. The initiative dubbed ‘Pepea Na Agribiz: Creating Wealth in Agribusiness’ is aimed at enhancing food security, enabling value addition, and creating sustainable jobs for youth and women. LakeHub programmes director Dorcas Owino said on Wednesday the initiative will provide opportunities like business development training, business coaching, investor readiness, crowdfunding and certification. In addition, the 100 selected beneficiaries will each receive a seed grant award of Sh300,000. “We recognise that agriculture is no longer just about digging in the soil, it is also about leveraging technology to improve productivity, increase efficiency, and income and accelerate small and medium size agribusiness enterprises,” Owino said. Purity Akoth from LakeHub said the agriculture sector employs more than 40 per cent of Kenya’s total population and more than 70 per cent of the rural populace. Akoth said despite having numerous financing opportunities from the banks, venture capital and micro-financing that supports agriculture, many small-scale agripreneurs still face stringent eligibility criteria, locking them out of financial access for expansion.
