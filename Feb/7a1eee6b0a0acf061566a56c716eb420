Strathmore Scorpions striker Gilly Okumu will be out for several weeks after spraining her tendons during the African Cup for Club Championship last week. The burly forward missed Scorpions' 3-0 loss to Ghana Revenue Authority in their last match of the week-long competition as the students finished sixth in the seven-team tournament. 'Strath' only mastered one win, a walkover against Kada Queens who gave the tournament a wide berth. "There was no fracture as I initially feared," Okumu said. "Just a tendon sprain. I will be out for at least two weeks. It was not like a normal sprain but I hope to bounce back stronger." Okumu was instrumental for the university side last season, helping the Meshack Senge-coached side to a maiden Kenya Hockey Union Premier League title. The experienced international player also captained the Commonwealth Games team in Birmingham. Okumu hopes to return to Germany's Eintrancht Frankfurt in April for a fourth spell. "The stage is set for me to return to Germany in April," she revealed.
