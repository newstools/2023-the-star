Moi Girls High School, Eldoret will be using home advantage as they seek to defend the Moi Girls Open football title this weekend. This weekend's two-day tournament has attracted 20 school teams as preparations for the start of the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association next weekend intensify. Moi Girls are bubbling with confidence after winning the Nakuru Open title two weekend's ago. Under the tutelage of Robert Simiyu, they beat Kenya Industrial Training Institute (KITI) 3-0 to lift the trophy. Kathleen Kurgat (brace) and Manda Were provided the goals away from home. “Our player Were was named the Most valuable Player during the Nakuru Open, which has given the team confidence heading into this weekend's tournament,” said Simiyu. Simiyu said that playing at home will give the girls courage and confidence as they will enjoy support from home fans. “We have the pressure to defend our title but that will not deter us from dominating the event. Playing at home will give the girls the courage the same way they did last year,” said Simiyu. Ultimately, he said, their goal is to reach the national finals and gatecrash the Federation of East Africa Secondary Schools Sports Association games in Burundi. He said they also want to repay the faith and support that has been accorded by school principal Juliana Kirui and Head of Department Joseph Nzioki. “Apart from the principal's support, our HOD has been tremendous, allowing students to enjoy playing the sport they like and that has yielded results,” said Simiyu.
