In this case, she is trying to figure out who to choose between you and the other guy or guys. She is testing you She might be trying to figure out if you are serious or if you are just 'passing'. She might be trying to figure out your intentions Some women get attached emotionally and therefore will play hard to get to gauge your intentions for her whether you want a relationship, situations, or you just want to sleep with her. By knowing what your intentions are, they can save themselves the heartbreak. She has an anxious-avoidant attachment style Fear of abandonment is a characteristic of the anxious-avoidant style. Maybe her last relationship did not work out and she has some baggage still. Some women can also act hard to get due to having been hurt in the past. Playing hard to get and not being interested in you are two different things. When she is not interested in you she will not reply to your texts, she will not entertain you, and she will blow you off constantly.
