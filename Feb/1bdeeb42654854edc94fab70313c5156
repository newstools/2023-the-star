Migori county police have launched investigations over a robbery incident on Sunday night where a night guard was killed, the second incident within a month. The 46-year-old guard only identified as James was killed and a total of 18 motorbikes stolen from the shop where he was working. Several motorbike spares were also stolen by unknown number of thugs who took control of the premises for several hours. “Police have taken over investigations over the incident and the body has been taken to Migori Referral hospital for postmortem examinations,” Migori county police chief Mark Wanjala said. The case has raised fear of runaway insecurity in the county as the death is second within a month. On February 17, a five-man gang armed with pangas and other crude weapons invaded a gold leaching plant within Kehancha town and assaulted two watchmen, one dying while receiving treatment. Mukusui Joseph, a Tanzanian aged 43 died while receiving treatment at Migori Referral hospital while his colleague, also a Tanzania, John Mathias, 38, survived with multiple injuries on the head. During the robbery, Sultan Enoch, trader, lost Tsh60,000 in the raid with unknown number of gold believed to have been stolen. Wanjala said they have increased patrols in all major towns and called on the public to help police with information that will lead to the arrest of the suspects.
