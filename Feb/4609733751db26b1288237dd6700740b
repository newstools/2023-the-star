The NBA-leading Boston Celtics coasted to a 139-96 win over the short-handed Brooklyn Nets, while the Minnesota Timberwolves outlasted the Golden State Warriors 119-114 in overtime on Wednesday. Jayson Tatum scored 31 points and Jaylen Brown added 26 as the Celtics have won all three meetings with the Nets this season. The Celtics never trailed and led by as many as 49 points en route to their largest victory of the season. Robert Williams finished with 16 points and nine rebounds for Boston in his return from a sprained ankle. Derrick White added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Coupled with Kevin Durant’s absence since spraining his right knee on January 8, Brooklyn was also with injured Ben Simmons and T.J. Warren, who both sat for the third straight game. Kyrie Irving scored 20 points and Cam Thomas added 19 for the Nets. Boston raced to a 33-7 advantage as the Nets started the game just 2 of 14 from the field. Tatum finished the first quarter with 18 points as Boston took a 46-16 edge, marking the first time in franchise history that Boston outscored its opponent by 30 in the opening period. The Celtics led 79-45 at halftime, meaning it was routine work for them to finish off the game. In Minneapolis, D’Angelo Russell scored 14 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, and after his fouling out early in overtime, Anthony Edwards took over to lead the Timberwolves past the defending champions. Edwards scored 27 points, helping the Timberwolves, who trailed by 11 after three quarters, complete the comeback. Edwards made a jumper to put Minnesota up 115-112 with 1:43 left.
