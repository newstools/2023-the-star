A tweet posted on March 2, 2022 by World Bank claiming that the United Nations climate conference popularly known as the #COP27 held in Egypt in November was the first in Africa,  is false. The tweet read: “#COP27 will be hosted by #Egypt, making it the first COP in Africa. This provides a great opportunity to look at the specific issues that will be shaping the transport and climate agendas in Africa & beyond”. The correct position is this was the fifth time the #COP27 was held in Africa. The first time the climate conference was held in Africa was in 2001 in Morocco, this was termed as #COP7, and in 2016 Morocco had the opportunity to host again, #COP22 In 2006, Kenya managed to host the #COP12 in its capital and South Africa hosted #COP17 in 2011. President William Ruto addressed the conference on behalf of Kenya and the African Group present.
