ODM leader Raila Odinga on Saturday paid last traditional respect to former Education Cabinet Secretary the late George Magoha. While in his Luo traditional attire, Raila arrived at the service held in Gem with a crowd cheering him up and walked up to the coffin. With a spear, shield and feathery hat, Raila spoke as the crowd cheered. "Jowi! Jowi!" he said while tapping on Magoha's coffin. He held the spear, at the same time as the shield and left the premises. Local mourners jerked themselves in excitement as Raila performed the Luo funeral rituals. Raila later returned to the main tent dressed in a blue suit and a large fedora hat. The normal program was disrupted, forcing Education Cabinet Secretary Ezekiel Machogu to pause his speech. The DJ had to play music to give Raila time to enter the venue and pay his respect to the late Magoha. The MC had a hard time bringing calm to the excited crowds before the speeches continued. Raila was accompanied by his spouse Ida Odinga.
