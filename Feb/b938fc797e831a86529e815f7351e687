Paul Tororei wants the Uasin Gishu county government to improve sports facilities in the region in a bid to boost sports in schools. Speaking after retaining his chairman’s post as the Uasin Gishu County Primary Schools Sports Association chairman, Tororei said in order to improve sports in the county, more needs to be done in terms of facilities. “We have bad sporting facilities in this county and that is why we are requesting the county government to put up more grounds for the sake of our children," he noted. He said whatever is there is not enough and yet the region has abundant talent. During the polls held at the Moi Girls in Eldoret, the former Uasin Gishu Football Kenya Federation chairman garnered 12 votes to edge out Edwin Kiptis, who garnered six votes. Sammy Sing’oe defeated Pius Cheruiyot 12-6  to win the vice chairman's position while Athletics Kenya (AK) Uasin Gishu County secretary James Lagat won the secretary post unopposed. Elphas Tarus is the new treasurer after beating challenger Rebecca Mining by 11-7 votes. He will be deputised by Ben Rono who beat Joseph Kosgei 12-6
