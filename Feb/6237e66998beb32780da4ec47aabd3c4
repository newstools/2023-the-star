Kisumu Senator Tom Ojienda skipped Azimio leader Raila Odinga's rally at Moi Stadium on Saturday. Ojienda is among the nine MPs from ODM who held a meeting with President William Ruto at Statehouse on February 7. They have been under sharp criticism from the party leaders to quit their positions in parliament and resign and seek fresh mandates. The legislators on Friday met Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. The MPs who appear to be warming up to Ruto have never taken the sentiments lying down maintaining Ruto was a legitimate president. ODM has already initiated plans to expel them from the party. "The legitimacy of the President has been validated by all the competent organs of the government empowered to do so under our Constitution," Suba South MP Caroli Omondi fired. Othes who were conspicuously missing during the rally were Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Caroli Omondi (Suba South), Shakeel Shabir (Kisumu East, Independent), Paul Abuor (Rongo) and John Owino (Awendo). Raila has branded the MPs as traitors accusing them of meeting Ruto under the guise of seeking development projects for their constituencies. "If you want to go and see the President as a personal project in State House, then go. But if you want to go and talk about issues that affect the party then you must be given permission by the party before you go," said Raila.
