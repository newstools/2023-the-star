Harmonize has removed a tattoo of his ex-girlfriend and fiancée Fridah Kajala. Harmonize's body is littered with tattoos of things he holds dear in his life. From Diamond Platnumz to the late Tanzanian President, his mzungu exes Sarah Michelotti and fiancee Fridah Kajala. Harmonize takes time to recognise those special people with body art as his ultimate sign of honour, affection, and commitment. In the latest video of the musician, netizens have noted that the tattoo of Kajala and her daughter Paula has been removed from his leg. The tattoo was of a much younger Fridah and toddler Paula, which meant the world to him when they were dating. Harmonize had it inked in May 2022. He had done this at the time to get her back. At the time, he said Kajala and Paula would forever remain his favourites, insisting he will never forget the moments they shared. "(K) & (P) Still my favourites Sitokaa na Kuwaza Siku Chache Tulizopishana Nitawaza Zaidi Kipindi Kirefu tulicho Ishi Kwa Upendo Mungu awabariki Sanaa...!!! na Awatangulie thanks,” Harmonize wrote. He had also been doing many publicity stunts to woo her back, including putting up a billboard to declare his love and regret for whatever had broken them up. That beautiful picture of Fridah and Paula has now been covered up by black ink. Kajala also had a tattoo of a red rose, while the two had also both done each other's initials on each other's necks, but wiped those out as well after splitting.
