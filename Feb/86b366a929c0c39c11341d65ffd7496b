Valentine’s day is one themed with love, roses, gifts, dinner, and getaways are some of the ways lovers use to show appreciation to their partners. On this day lovers expect to receive something out of the ordinary from their partners. Friends and families are also celebrated. Spreading love to the less fortunate is also welcomed on this day, reminding them that they are still lovable. I know the economy is hard but can we make our partners feel special? Even though you get to show your love through buying gifts, there are gifts that you shouldn’t buy for your partner this valentine. An Oversized Teddy Bear Do not buy her an oversized teddy bear leave this for the kids. It will end up cluttering the house. Heart Shaped Jewelry Women will always need jewellery but have this on your to-do list, not her wish list. A Candle Candles are not personalized gifts; you can buy this after Valentines but not on valentines day. Whether it’s scented or not do not buy it. Cheap Lingerie Do not buy cheap lingerie. You might end up buying the wrong size, the wrong colour, or even the wrong material. Household Appliances She might need a vacuum, toaster, microwave, or fridge but get it for her later on in the year. Fitness Equipment She said or he said he wants to work out and keep fit but this is not the time to get that treadmill machine or that skipping rope. Tap into your creative mind. Last year's valentine gift It’s time to be creative, think outside the box, and ask them for gift ideas weeks before valentine day or a month before so that you plan yourself financially. Socks or Boxers Do not buy these. Plan early. As you receive the gifts and give the gift, remember you deserve the love.
