Millions of voters in southern Ethiopia are casting their ballots on Monday in a referendum to establish a new regional state. This is the third such referendum - all in the country’s south - held in the past four years. Previous votes saw the formation of Sidama and South-Western Ethiopia regions. More than three million people are registered to vote in this election - which will be held in six sub-regional administrative units (zones) and five districts that have been part of the Southern Ethiopian Nations, Nationalities and People’s (SNNP) region. The new region is to be called Southern Ethiopia region, if it gets a yes vote.
