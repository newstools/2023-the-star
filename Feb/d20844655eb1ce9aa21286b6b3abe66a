An international aid effort is being stepped up in southern Turkey and northern Syria following a huge earthquake that has killed more than 5,000 people. Rescuers are racing to save people trapped beneath the rubble after thousands of buildings collapsed in both countries. A Turkish journalist tells the BBC that people are sending him and other journalists videos, voice notes and their live locations from under the rubble. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck near Gaziantep in the early hours of Monday while people were asleep. A 7.5-magnitude tremor then hit at around 13:30 local time (10:30 GMT), which officials said was "not an aftershock". The country's disaster agency says more than 3,419 people were killed in Turkey alone after the first quake, and more than 15,000 were injured. More than 1,600 people are reported to have died in Syria. Countries including the US and South Korea are sending aid after Turkey issued an international appeal for help.
