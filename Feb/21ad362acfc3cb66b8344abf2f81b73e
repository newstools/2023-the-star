City lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi has raised concerns over the list of CAS nominees released by the Public Service Commission. In a tweet, on Tuesday the senior counsel, who is a supporter of President William Ruto said the list is not fresh as it is full of familiar faces in past regimes. “...patriotism or grand scheme to steal...,” Ahmednasir said. The list of 224 individuals shortlisted for interview for the post of Cabinet Administrative Secretaries has prominent individuals such as former governors, senators, MPs and notable TV personalities. Former governors include Evans Kidero(Nairobi), John Mruttu(Taita Taveta), Samwel Tunai(Narok), James Ongwae(Kisii), Samwel Ragwa(Tharaka Nithi), Patrick Khaemba(Trans Nzoia), Hussein Dado(Tana River), Moses Lelonkulal(Samburu) and former Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala. Former MPs Caleb Kositany (Soy), Chris Wamalwa (Kiminini), Charles Njagua alias Jaguar (Starehe) and Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda), Catherine Waruguru(Laikipia), Bishop Margaret Wanjiru, Millicent Omanga(Nairobi) and Dennitah Ghati(ex-nominated MP). Ex-Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion, digital strategist Dennis Itumbi and media personality Linda Oguttu also made it to the shortlist. The PSC said the publication of the names followed the conclusion of the shortlisting exercise pursuant to the provisions of Article 132(4)(a) of the Constitution and Section 30 of the Public Service Commission Act, 2017. "The shortlisted candidates will be interviewed at the Public Service Commission, off Harambee Avenue Nairobi starting March 1, 2023. The interview schedule showing the date and time is accessible on the Commission’s website," PSC said. Kenyans on Twitter shared mixed reactions regarding the shortlist.
