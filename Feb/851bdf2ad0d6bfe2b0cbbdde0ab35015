Umoja 2 MCA Shadrack Machanje wants Nairobi County askaris to form friendly working relationships with traders to avoid unnecessary street clashes. According to the first-term MCA, Nairobi residents have become tired of seeing violent scenes of running confrontations between the two parties. Machanje asked both parties to convene a meeting where their representatives would map out the next steps. He also urged the county authorities to look into ways to cut taxes levied on city vendors. Machanje remarked that the county government asks traders to apply for various licenses, which proved to be an expensive undertaking. "We are in challenging economic circumstances, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for Kenyan firms to thrive in the face of these difficulties," Machanje added. "Under the current conditions, it is no longer economically sustainable for dealers to continue seeking separate operational licenses." In Nairobi, one must obtain a unified business permit from the county to operate a business. The document incorporates all of the permissions required to operate a business in the county, including a business license, a fire clearance certificate, a permit for advertising signage, a health certificate, and a permit for food hygiene. Every business should have a trade license and a fire clearance certificate. Consumables companies must also have a health certificate and a food hygiene license. A license for advertising signage is required for all entities that have advertising signage (300mm by 600 mm or less). The unified business permit application allows business owners to apply for multiple licenses in one application rather than visiting many agencies. The permit is valid for one calendar year, after which time the applicant must apply for renewal.
