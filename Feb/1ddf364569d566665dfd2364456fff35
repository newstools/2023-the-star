Two men who were sentenced to death for robbery with violence will now serve life in prison. This is after a Narok court set aside the death sentence and commuted it to life imprisonment. Dennis Kareithi and Joshua Kobia had filed for a review of their death sentence asking for a lenient sentence. Justice Gikonyo ruled that in reviewing the sentence he had to consider the manner in which the offence was committed. He said in this particular case it was cruel how the robbery was done and the weapons used were dangerous The court also said it had considered the security of society from criminals. "In the circumstances of this case the deterrent sentence is most appropriate" the court ruled. In the case, evidence showed that the convicts were armed with a gun and robbed two people at gunpoint. During the robbery, they stole Sh23,400, one mobile phone, four jackets and at the time of the robbery used actual violence on the victims The court noted that the convicts were found with the items robbed from the victims and they could not explain how they came to be in possession of the items.
