President William Ruto has continued to come under criticism over his resolved to take on the former first family head on over taxes. Safina leader Jimmy Wanjigi is the latest to ask the president to steer clear of any clash with the Kenyatta family whom he has insinuated to be tax cheats. Speaking on Sunday at Power of Faith Church International in Kiambu, the former presidential candidate warned the government to leave Mzee Jomo Kenyatta's property alone saying saying targeting it won't help the government. "Hamutatatua mkitafuta mali ya Jomo Kenyatta. That one we will not allow," he said. Wanjigi said if the Kenya Kwanza regime has a bone to settle with former President Uhuru Kenyatta, it should focus on him alone. While making reference to the scriptures on the plight of widows and orphans, Wanjigi said Mzee Jomo Kenyatta's family should not be attacked. "Why are you targeting Mama Ngina? Now you are crossing the line because if you are after his property, who are we?" he asked. On Saturday, Mama Ngina fired back at the state over the allegations that she has been absconding taxes. While speaking at a church in Lamu county, the former first lady said the due process of the law should be followed in addressing the matter rather than soiling people's names. "There is no need of spoiling my name and that of others so that you can be seen to be working. Let those accused be taken to court and pay what he or she is supposed to pay," she said. She went on to dare the state to auction her properties in the event she is discovered to have failed to meet her tax obligation. Mama Ngina said the attacks meted out on her family are unfair and false further challenging the state to come clean on the issue instead of politicking. "It is not true that I have not paid tax and people know they are not saying the truth," she said.
