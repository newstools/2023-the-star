The demand by MPs to have fresh registration of recruitment agencies that send Kenyans to work in foreign nations is one that is much needed. Instances of Kenyans working in mostly Middle Eastern countries ending up dead, being neglected or tortured have become a norm. Kenyans have gotten used to the sad state of affairs. However, the issue on welfare of Kenyans working in foreign land is one that needs very urgent and decisive measures taken. Though it is a good thing when Kenyans get employment abroad and send money back home, cases of torture and death cannot be tolerated. The government needs to go a step further and ensure that before renewing the licences of those recruitment agencies, there is  mandatory requirement for basic level training. This  will help every domestic worker sent out of the country get well versed with things like culture of people he or she is going to work for and how to operate simple electronic equipment or household gadgets. Domestic workers also need to be educated about their rights and channels they can use to address any violations should such occur. Our embassies are first point of call for any worker outside the country and the workers need to be informed. The government needs to review some of its agreements with some of the countries where these cases are reported and negotiate better deals in terms of pay for its people.
