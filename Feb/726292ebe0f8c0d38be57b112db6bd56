The Directorate of Criminal Investigation volleyball team has nothing to fear against Nairobi Water and Kenya Pipeline in the league matches this weekend at Nyayo Stadium. DCI coach Daniel Bor said his charges gleaned valuable lessons following their fourth position in last season's playoffs. The team is now ready to conquer the courts, having come off age according to the soft-spoken gaffer. He said: "We want to secure maximum points. We are no longer a small team. We know we lost in straight sets to Pipeline in the playoffs last month but we cannot afford to have such performance again." "We have worked on our challenges and I am counting on all the players to rise to the occasion," Bor added. Sarah Namisi was named the league's best attacker last season after her heroics in the playoffs. Bor said Namisi will get even better since age is on her side. "She has what it takes to terrorise defenses. She must now target the Most Valuable Player accolade this season. If she continues that way, the sensation will soon earn Malkia Strikers call up." He went on: "Players are now settled and focused after undergoing mandatory training at Kiganjo. We are no longer cry babies. We must face the reality that we are a big team with the capacity to face any of our rivals."
