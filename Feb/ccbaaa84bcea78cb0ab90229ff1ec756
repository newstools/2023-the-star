Indefatigable Neel Gohil believes his season-opening double at SUC Kenya National Autocross Championship 1 race at the Twisty Corners will serve to boost his confidence levels. The Nairobi-based prodigy racked up a rare double victory to begin the season at the summit. The 2022 junior champion moved up to the competitive 2WD non-turbo car class and non-turbo buggy categories and emerged the victor in both classes. And he delivered a drive of drives with Fastest Time of the Day (FTD) in both categories to savour early points for his double 2023 season championship campaign. Neel, who is one of the fastest-rising youngsters in the country at the moment, was all smiles and said: “It’s such a great feeling to start the season on a high. But then again, pressure tends to mount when you come to think that all your race adversaries will be taking the fight to you,” Meanwhile, Lubricant City Limited -distributors of the premium Liqui-moly brand and Taisho Auto Parts, will once again sponsor Neel for the 2023 season. “We are proud of Neel’s achievements in 2022 and will walk the journey in 2023 with him as he chases the big dream to become a championship winner in two categories in the series and also tries out the RX,” said Harshil CEO of Lubricant City. Imran Khan of Taisho Auto remarked that he is proud to be a part of the team's success and by extension, Neel’s stellar performance in 2022. Taisho has come on board to ensure the team savours a comprehensive spare part support program for Neel’s 2023 plans.
