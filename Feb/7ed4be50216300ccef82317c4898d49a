Broadways Bakery has decried the difficult business environment brought about by the high cost of production. The company’s head of business development and marketing, Devan Shah, said the business environment is getting tougher each day due to the high cost of wheat flour, fuel and electricity. He said they have been forced to improve on efficiency in operations, so as not to pass the costs to their customers. “The last two years post-Covid-19 have been difficult. Global wheat prices are high, fuel prices have been erratic and electricity charges have been going up. However, we understand that bread is a staple product and have ensured we don’t pass the costs on to our customers. Instead, we look for other ways of reducing the cost of production,” Shah said. He spoke during a company meeting in Thika, where together with their sister company Bakex, they were awarded the Superbrands seal for being exemplary brands in the market. Broadways and Bakex have been on the market for 65 and 40 years respectively. Broadways Group chief executive officer Francis Musila said they are embarking on a project to increase bread lines to reach more customers. He said they have invested in a new plant to increase the production capacity of bread. “Our customer base is high and over the years, we have been unable to meet the demand, as we can only produce what we can. However, this year, we have established a new plant to increase our production. We are also working on a project to increase our breadlines to grow our customer base,” said Musila, On the high cost of production, he called on the government to move away from fuel generated electricity to hydro or geothermal power, so as to reduce power costs. “I see no reason why we should be using more fuel-based power, which is leading to the increase in cost of electricity,” he said. Rohin Shah, a director at Bakex Company, said they are working on improving technology and efficiency in their operations so as to cut costs.
