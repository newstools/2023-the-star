A nominated MCA has offered to pay school fees for a student who scored 388 marks in last year’s KCSE examinations but failed to report to Maseno school for lack of fees. Joel Okwako who sits in the county assembly of Kakamega admitted Bartista Andanje to Mukumu Boys High School and committed to pay for the four years. Andanje was expected to have reported to Maseno School on February 6. However, his father, who is a casual labourer could not meet his educational needs. The boy, who schooled at Nabongo primary school, has been living with his grandmother at Shikhambi estate in Kakamega town. Okwako said that he came across Bartista’s case on WhatsApp groups and was compelled to help him. “When I went to his home, I realized that his chances of pursuing his high school education were futile as the grandmother is helpless. I then decided to take up the case,” he said. Bartista appreciated the support and promised to score Grade A in the KCSE exams. “I will not let him down. He came to my rescue when least thought I would find someone to sponsor my education,” he said.
