A Kakamega family wants justice for their daughter who was allegedly defiled by a priest. The parent said his daughter sat her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams last year. He said that he reported the matter to the police but no action has since been taken. “He was arrested after we recorded our statements two months ago. The next thing I was told was that he was released on bond and nothing seems to be happening,” he said. He said that he had established that the priest started having an affair with his daughter in March last year. “We were called to the school as Form Four parents and some teachers told me that my daughter was dating the priest. It was not a secret until it ended up in defilement because my child was 17 years then,” he said He said that the priest disappeared with his daughter for three days when the schools closed in August. “I was told that they took my child to a chemist without my knowledge and I am yet to know what they went to do. I want justice to be served,” he said. He said that police officers told him to wait until his daughter completed exams so they could act but the matter has gone silent even after she finished her exams. He said that his daughter was bright and could perform better but she ended up getting a C (minus) in KCSE. Responding to the claims, Kakamega Central deputy DCIO Lucy Wamutiro said investigations into the case were complete. “We’re waiting for directions by the office of the Director of Public Prosecution as to whether the suspect should be taken to court or not,” Wamutiro said.
