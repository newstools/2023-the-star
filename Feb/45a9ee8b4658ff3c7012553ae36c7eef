Dumas took the first quarter 23-19, trailed 16-14 in the second and 23-33 in the third before taking the fourth 14-10 but was not enough. "The men started well and were leading by half time. We slowed down in the second half," bankers' tactician David Maina said. "Eldonets started shooting very well and we could not stop their shoots. We found ourselves chasing the game," he added.
