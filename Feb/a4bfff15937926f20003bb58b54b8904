Thika Queens has confirmed the signing of midfielder Lorna Nyarinda. The all-action midfielder is expected to shore up the department that has been the team's Achilles heel, coach Fred Majani has said. The former Vihiga Queens player was unattached and has not played for almost a year according to Majani. "I am happy that we have managed to secure the services of Nyarinda who I know will boost our options in midfield," Majani hinted. "She has not played for a year but that is not something to worry us. She is below 24 years and has a lot of experience playing for Vihiga. She has trained with us for just two weeks but I am impressed." Majani noted that her fitness levels are good. "She might even play this weekend against Zetech Sparks." Thika are second in the Women's Premier League standings with 21 points, a point behind leaders and defending champions Vihiga Queens. Majani hinted at more additions before the weekend, adding that at least three more players will make his squad complete. "We still need a goalkeeper, a defender and a striker. Hopefully, we will have more new faces by the weekend.Â  The aim is to finish the first leg at the apex of the log. Vihiga play Gaspo and a draw will favour us big time."
