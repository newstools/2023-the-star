Vihiga senator Godfrey Osotsi has told off Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua over devolution funds. Osotsi was addressing the press while at Ibubi girls for financial support to set up latrines that had initially collapsed before the resumption of learning at the institution. The senator said the  DP is unfit to protect the devolution that Kenyans wanted for many years. He said devolution needs a sober leader who will understand the needs of the devolved units. The lawmaker's sentiments come after the DP  told off governors over the demand for extra allocation. "Ile pesa ambayo iko ni Sh380 billion hata mukitutoa nguo mutuchape hiyo ndio iko," DP Gachagua told the council of governors. The lawmaker said Kenya Kwanza Administration is eyeing to cripple devolution by cutting down its budget. He urged the DP not to interfere with the CRA work saying it is the only body allocated the mandate to determine what should be disbursed to counties. "As the Senate, we won't allow any stalemate. We will ensure everything is harmonized for the devolved units to go on with their work," Osotsi said. The senator says the government had proposed Sh425 billion to be wired to counties however currently, they have slashed it to Sh380 billion. “President William Ruto's administration had promised to support devolved units by increasing their budget during the campaigns," Osotsi said. "But what we are hearing now is a different story from what they were saying and the worst part of it is they are not giving devolved units money on time as well," he added. Osotsi says devolution was brought to develop this Country and to ensure service delivery to citizens
