A senior police officer spent his weekend in custody after he lost his official firearm in Narok. Narok Central police boss Fredrick Shiundu Kinaibei was arrested after he lost his firearm on Wednesday. He is also expected to face charges. Kinaibei was Wednesday morning rescued after being abducted and robbed of a firearm at his home by armed people in Narok county. Kinaibei told his colleagues he was confronted by two armed men while opening his home gate at midnight on February 8. Police said he was forced into a Toyota Wish, whose registration is not known, and drove off towards Mau Narok’s direction. His wife alerted the police at the station on the phone that the senior officer had been abducted. They rushed to his home and established that he was abducted while opening his gate. His vehicle was found outside the gate with the engine running and his mobile phone inside. The motive was not immediately known, but the kidnappers were located in the Tipis area about 77 kilometres from the scene. This prompted a search in the area. He was found abandoned in Tipis near a river at 3.30am still in police uniform. “They dumped him at Tipis area and was rescued by a watchman. He was not injured during the incident,” the police said. The police said his firearm, which was loaded with 14 rounds of 9mm, was stolen. An investigation has since established that the information he gave was misleading, hence the move to detain him. Narok police commander Kizito Mutoro said they are investigating the incident. “We are hunting the men who stole the weapon,” he said.
