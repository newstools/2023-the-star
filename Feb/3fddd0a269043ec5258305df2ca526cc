Stivo Simple Boy has revealed he has a wife. He showed her off during the burial of his dad over the weekend in Siaya. While addressing mourners and paying his tribute, the rapper asked a woman to come forward and greet mourners, saying she is his wife. She introduced herself to the crowd and shyly told mourners that she was very close to Stivos's dad, whom she adored. The rapper's ex-girlfriend Pritty Vishy has, however, dismissed the news. Taking to her Instagram yesterday, Vishy used 'Ask me a question' to reveal her thoughts about his new wife. One fan asked, "How have you taken the news of Stivo's public announcement about him being married?" Vishy replied, "All I know about marriage is that there must be a wedding. Otherwise, come we stay is not marriage."
