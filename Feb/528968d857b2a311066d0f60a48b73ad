Teachers Service Commission has interdicted five teachers and the headteacher of the Itumbe DOK primary school in Nyamache, Kisii county. This is following a viral video showing teachers forcing pupils to imitate a sex scene. A letter dated February 2 and addressed to the teachers by TSC pointed out that coercing the pupils to engage in such actions was aÂ  breach of Clause 9 (1) of the Code of Conduct and Ethics for Teachers. TSC said the six pupils who were all in Grade 2 were exposed to trauma, psychological torture and embarrassment. "You are hereby interdicted with effect from February 2," the letter signed by E.J. Mitei on behalf of TSC CEO Nancy Macharia read in part. Further, they were directed to vacate the school premises and continue to be away, and forfeit their annual leave. Mitei invited the teachers to make their defence statement by writing to the Commission within 21 days from today (Thursday). The six, TSC said, will be given an opportunity to be heard in person, directing them to indicate the nearest TSC sub-county office where they are expected to report once a month. In the video, the under-aged pupils, under the watch of the teachers were recorded mounting on each other demonstrating a sexual act.
