Two-time Indian Olympian Aditi Ashok has attributed her maiden Magical Kenya Ladies Open victory to off-season hard work and precision hitting. Ashok made it look so simple over the past four days to win the coveted ‘giraffe trophy’ with a massive nine-stroke advantage. The Indian totally bossed the par 73 PGA Baobab Vipingo course with a score of 12 under par 280 gross after she carded 67, 70, 69 and 74 in the 72-hole stroke play event. Ashok received her trophy from First Lady Rachael Ruto in the presence of Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba and his Tourism counterpart Peninah Malonza. England’s Alice Hewson and April Angurasaranee tied for second on 3 under par 289 although the latter was left to rue what she described a 'bad last round'. Ashok was all smiles as her trophy was delivered to the venue in a parachute, which caused quite a stir near the clubhouse. “It's such a great feeling winning in Kenya in the presence of giraffes on the course and my dad (Pandit Ashok) caddying. Kenya is definitely different from other country's and winning here evokes a feeling of anticipation into the new season. My fitness team did well to get me into the rhythm," she said. "My training during the off-season has really paid off and I want to thank my fitness team for their unending effort,” remarked Aditi, who returned for the Ladies European Tour (LET) event for the second time in four years. Thailand’s Angurasaranee has had a great week of golf and was happy with her last round after she posted a 77. “I am definitely happy to finish second as a rookie and on my first visit to Kenya. But it was not the last round I wanted,” said Angurasaranee, who shot two eagles on Saturday’s penultimate round. Angurasaranee’s last bad day saw her shoot four bogies and one double bogie. Kenya’s Naomi Wafula made history as the first ever Kenyan to make an LET cut. She finished 56th with 18 over par 310. Sports CS Namwamba remarked that Wafula has inspired a generation of women and junior golfers to embrace the sport. “We invite investors to partner with us to take sports to the next level.  I am glad that this tournament is being broadcast live across the globe which is a great opportunity to not only showcase Kenya as a tourist destination but also to players like Naomi Wafula,” said Namwamba. The First Lady congratulated Chanelle Wangari and Wafula for their determination at the event. “May I take this opportunity to convey greetings from His Excellency the President of the Republic of Kenya William Ruto. Tournaments like this inspire the youth to take up the sport and market the country as a tourist destination,” said the First Lady.  Final MKLO results 1.
