Teen rapper Trio Mio released a new song featuring Sauti Sol's Savara a few weeks after he received his secondary KCSE exam results. In the three-minute track titled 'Every Day', Trio sings about love. Through his Instagram page, Trio Mio said love is all about being all-rounded. "Love ni kuitana babe. Love is a warm plate of your favourite meal at the end of the day," he said. "Love ni kushikwa mkono ukivuka barabara. Love is a phone call in the middle of a busy day. Love ni muchene ya siku na mtu wako. Love is inside jokes. Love ni chum kwa forehead. Love is every day." Barely 24 hours after it was uploaded on YouTube, the song has more than 90,000 views on YouTube.
