Rugby 15’s has been included in the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Term One games. This will be the first time the longer version will be played in three years. According to a circular from Basic Education Principal Secretary, Belio Kipsang, rugby 7’s will now be played in Term Two. Cross country has also been included in the Term One calendar of events alongside 5x5 basketball while 3x3 basketball will be played in Term Two. There was confusion after regions sent conflicting calendars on rugby with some indicating that rugby 7’s was to be played in Term One and 15s in Term Two. Other Term One disciplines include athletics, hockey, handball and swimming while Term Two will also have football under-16 and under-18, volleyball, netball, 3x3 basketball, rugby 7’s and racquet games. Last year, when the games resumed after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, only the Sevens version was played. At the same time, the Federation of East Africa Secondary Schools Association games will be held in Rwanda and not Burundi as earlier announced, Kipsang's circular added. Meanwhile, the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association national elections will be held on Friday at Jogoo House in Nairobi. The current office holders, Kapsabet High School principal Kipchumba Maiyo, secretary general David Ngugi and treasurer Kariuki Gikonyo are likely to be re-elected unopposed. “At the moment, all national office bearers will be re-elected. Nobody has declared their intention to oppose them,” said a source.
