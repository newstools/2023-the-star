Former Nyeri town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has said  Azimio leader Raila Odinga will not do his oversight role as the opposition unless he lets go of the August 9, 2022, general elections. Ngunjiri said Raila cannot engage with the government as long as he denies the legitimacy of the Kenya Kwanza regime. "Opposition is not going to do its job for today until they let go of the election, because for as long as they don't let go of the election how do they engage with the government, how do you oversight a government whose legitimacy you don't accept?" Speaking during an interview at Spice FM on Thursday, Ngunjiri said Raila should accept that losing an election is part of what happens when you run for office. "We need to agree on when to close a chapter. So, when an election is finished, we have to agree at what point that chapter is closed so that we now move to the next position," he said. Ngunjiri said Raila has gone through the process that the people understand, and it determined that he did not win. Despite this, Ngunjiri said, Raila is mobilising his supporters to affirm he won the August 9 elections. He said anyone can mobilise supporters and termed what the Azimio chief is doing as a bad precedent. "I completely disagree with what Raila is doing, because it is a bad precedent, he exhausted every avenue that existed, when you got to the supreme court, there is nowhere else you can go," he said.
