Former Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha will be laid to rest on Saturday, February 11, at his rural home in Siaya. However, before that, there will be three major events leading to his final journey. Speaking at Magoha's Lavington home, former Basic Education and Early Learning Principal Secretary Julius Jwan said there will be a caravan of the professor in Nairobi starting at 10 am to various institutions he served. "The caravan will go through places that defined the adult life of Magoha," he said. On February 8, the farewell caravan will go through Kenyatta National Hospital, Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council headquarters, Kenya National Examinations Council headquarters, St Georges Primary, State House Girls, University of Nairobi and Starehe Centre. The late Magoha's caravan will also be taken to the Nigerian High Commission office as he trained as a Medical practitioner at the University of Lagos in Nigeria. He also furthered his studies in Surgery and Urology at Lagos University Teaching Hospital. From 9 am on February 9, there will be a requiem mass at the Consolata Shrine in Westlands. Jwan said Magoha's body will arrive at the Township Primary School in Yala at 1 pm on February 10, afterwards, there will be a procession leading up to St Mary's High School, Yala. "It should be borne in mind that in his last tour of duty as Cabinet Secretary for Education, Prof Magoha was always in the midst of children and students," he said. Later, there will be a Holy Mass at Magoha's home in Umiru, Nyamninia village. Magoha passed on January 24, after suffering a cardiac arrest. He collapsed at home before he was rushed to Nairobi hospital, where he was announced dead.
