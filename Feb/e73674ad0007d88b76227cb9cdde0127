Football Kenya Federation Women's Premier League champions Vihiga Queens are in talks to sign experienced former Gaspo striker Bertha Omitta when the transfer window opens this Sunday. Queens coach Boniface Nyamunyamu said Omitta will bring a wealth of experience should they manage to sign her up. Omitta who is without a club is back in the country after a short spell in India. "We want to sign a proven player at the highest level and Omitta fits the bill," Nyamunyamu said. "She is proven and will offer guidance to our young attackers. Diana Cherono, Shalyn Opisa and Eunice Nsia will benefit ." Vihiga lost the attacking trio of Tereza Engesha, Jentrix Shikangwa and Topista Situma to professional stints abroad. Elsewhere, Ulinzi Starlets hold an interest in Kangemi Ladies attacking sensation Fasila Adhiambo. Adhiambo 20, was an inspiration last season, finishing second in the top-scoring charts despite Kangemi's plight. The minnows were last in the 12-team standings. The decision by the Sports Dispute Tribunal to declare the 2021-22 season null and void breathed a sigh of relief to the Kawangware-based side because they would have been relegated to the Division One league. "The interest is there but nothing is done at the moment. We are playing against Kangemi this weekend and I cannot comment much," Joseph Mwanza, the Ulinzi coach said. "The injury to Siliya Rasoa means we need another striker. Don't forget Jentrix Kuyudi is away for career progression."
