The International Organization for Migration East and Horn of Africa has donated 280 tonnes of humanitarian and relief supplies as part of its emergency response to help people affected by earthquake in Turkye and Syria. At least 2.4 million people have been displaced with an estimated 24 million said to have been affected as a result of the devastating quakes which hit the two countries on February 6. The aid which includes tents, blankets, sleeping mats, and tarpaulins left Nairobi onboard three cargo planes.  Turkish Ambassador to Kenya Subutay Yüksel and IOM Deputy Regional Director Justin MacDermott were present at the departure of the aid consignment. “We convey our commitment to our governmental partners to provide the necessary humanitarian assistance with all IOM’s global capacity to ensure life-saving assistance," MacDermott said. "At IOM, we are committed to ensuring that much-needed humanitarian aid reaches those most in need in a timely manner, he added. "The prepositioned humanitarian aid had been held in Nairobi, at one of IOM’s largest warehouses globally, which is strategically positioned to quickly respond to emergencies in the region and beyond. More than 1,200 IOM staff in Türkiye are assisting earthquake-affected people in the Southeast of the country and Northwest Syria. IOM is also working in coordination with the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Presidency of Migration Management, and the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority, the Ministry of Family and Social Services and Turkish Red Crescent as well as IOM field offices to mobilise all available humanitarian support in the response to the quake. With its supply chain management experience and logistics capacity, IOM has said it will continue to extend its capacity, post-earthquake with technical support from its regional and global experts.
