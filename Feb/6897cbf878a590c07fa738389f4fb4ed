Police in Kisumu have arrested three suspects for allegedly defiling a minor in a guest house within the city. The 16-year-old girl, who had been booked in a guest house, was allegedly defiled interchangeably by the three suspects for three days. County police commander Alphonse Kimanthi said the suspects were arrested by police officers from Kondele Police Station on Friday. He said the minor had travelled to visit her aunt. She, however, got stranded at the bus park as she did not know where to head before she was intercepted and booked in a guest house. The minor was later joined in the room by the three who defiled her interchangeably. The victim managed to escape after the suspects forgot the key to the room. “The minor was later rescued by her brother who found her helplessly in a trench in Manyatta estate,” Kimanthi said. She told the brother that she had been defiled by three men. The brother took her to the Kondele police station where they reported the matter. The officers trailed the suspects and arrested them. Police recovered the key to the room and the receipt for the room. The suspects were taken for immediate examination and the victim for medication. The police boss said the suspects are expected to be arraigned in court on Monday.
