The transfer window in the Kenya Football Federation Leagues will officially be opened on February 27, Head of Leagues and Competitions director Doreen Nabwire has said. Clubs will now have the opportunity to beef up their squads for the second half of the season. "FKF wishes to notify all FKF PL, NSC, WPL, Division One Men and Women clubs that the second player registration period /Transfer window for the leagues shall officially open on Monday, February 27, 2023, at midnight  and shall close on Monday March 27, 2023, at 1700hrs," part of FKF statement read. Teams are urged to do their business early to avoid registration delays. "Only players whose transfers and/or registrations will be completed by Wednesday of every week shall be eligible  to play in the weekend matches. This is to allow us ample time to process their licenses," the statement further explains. "Any transfers and/or registrations received after Wednesday shall be approved and processed the following week." Injury-hit teams like Women's Premier League side Vihiga Queens have earmarked their attack as a potential area  to address. Former Gaspo striker Bertha Omitta is on their  radar. FKF Super Cup champions Ulinzi Starlets are also on the lookout for further reinforcements. The soldiers have expressed interest in Fasila Adhiambo. The Kangemi Ladies all-action forward was the runner up top scorer last season with 14 goals.
