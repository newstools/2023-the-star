Azimio supporters on Sunday turned up in numbers at the Kamukunji grounds in Kibra for the Azimio consultative rally led by Raila Odinga. The meeting, which has been dubbed 'People's Baraza' marks the third public rally that Raila has held this year. The previous rallies were held on January 23 and 29 at Kamukunji and Jacaranda grounds respectively. Announcing the rally, Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said that they will also hold another meeting on Friday, February 10. "This will be followed by another Baraza on Friday, 10th February 2023, this time in Mavoko, Machakos county," he said. Raila is expected to speak largely on the cost of living and alleged vote rigging. Also present at the rally are Martha Karua, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi.
