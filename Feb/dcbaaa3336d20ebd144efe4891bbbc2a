Sector players in Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) have been challenged to come up with more digital solutions at the forthcoming connected Kenya summit. They have been urged to exhaustively deliberate on current technological trends and come up with outcomes that are essential in addressing the country’s digital divide. This will be during the summit scheduled for April 2 to 5 in Kwale. Dubbed, 'The Digital Economy: Endless Opportunities Shaping The Future', the forum will bring together more than 1,000 local and international delegates. It will seek to bank on private-public partnerships towards the realisation of digital solution outcomes that will contribute to the country's economic development. It will also seek to mirror the previous summits which have seen the birth of key public service innovations such as the Huduma, e- citizen, Presidential Digital Talent Programme as well as the National ICT Master Plan of 2017. "We therefore anticipate that this year’s forum will add to this bucket of innovations thus support the delivery of the Digital Super Highway," the Principal Secretary, State Department of ICT John Tanui said. Speaking at the announcement ceremony, ICT Cabinet Secretary Eliud Owalo said that Kenya is already a regional ICT hub and such platforms will seek to boost its status to a globally competitive digital economy. “This is well in line with the Kenya Kwanza government whose flagship projects include the development of 100,000 kilometers of fibre optic infrastructure and rolling out 25,000 government funded hotspots for public access to WIFI countrywide,” Owalo said. He said the government would further seek to accelerate the automation and digitalisation of all core government services and implement the national physical addressing system as well as the national spatial data infrastructure to promote the growth of e-commerce.
