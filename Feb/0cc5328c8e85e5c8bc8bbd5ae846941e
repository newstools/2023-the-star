Parliament will next Friday vet Solicitor-General nominee Shadrack Mose. The National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, which will conduct the approval hearings, has called for the submission of public views. The vetting exercise will be held at the County Hall on February 24 before the name is finally submitted to the House for approval. The committee chaired by Tharaka MP George Murugara has asked members of the public to send memorandums to the panel for consideration. Those with views have until February 22 to submit to the committee sworn affidavits with supporting evidence. Mose, the immediate former Kitutu Masaba MP, was nominated by President William Ruto following a competitive recruitment process by the Public Service Commission. Ruto picked Mose from a shortlist of the top three candidates that were submitted to him by the PSC. According to the list Mose topped the interviews that were conducted by PSC. In position two was Beatrice Meso while George Kithi emerged in position three in the competitive interviews. The Solicitor General is the accounting officer at the State Law Office and Department of Justice – currently headed by Attorney General Justin Muturi. The Office of the Attorney General Act provides that the Solicitor General shall assist the Attorney General in the performance of the AG’s duties. Mose, if approved, will take over from Ken Ogeto. Ogeto was appointed to the position by President Uhuru Kenyatta in March 2018 for five years. Ogeto assumed the post from Njee Muturi who was then moved to the post of State House Deputy Chief of Staff in changes. Mose unsuccessfully defended the Kitutu Masaba Parliamentary seat on a UDA party ticket. He served in the 12th Parliament on a Jubilee ticket. Coincidentally, both Mose and Ogeto come from Nyamira County.
