Cats can be interesting pets if you are a cat person. They can be domesticated or street cats. They are part of the cat family Felidae which includes cheetah, puma, jaguar, lion and tiger among others. Growing up and even to date I know a cat has nine lives but is it true though? Here are some facts about cats. Cats are nearsighted and have a better peripheral and night vision While humans have 206 bones, cats have 230. Male cats are likely to be left-pawed and female ones to be right-pawed. This signifies their dominant paw. They sleep a lot. The movement of their tails and their body language communicate what they want. For example, yawning can be used to end a confrontation, kneading is a way to show contentment and comfort, and wagging of their tail shows you are getting on their nerves. They rub their faces or body against you or surfaces as a way of marking their territory. They love grooming themselves and grooming other cats. Their whiskers allow them to detect change and respond to their surroundings. Kittens can get pregnant at 4 months old. They have a similar stride to camels and giraffes. They are dangerous when provoked. They have one life, not nine.
