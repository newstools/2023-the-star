The Orthodox Church on Friday asked the government to come up with strategies that will help the country produce enough food for all seasons. It says the country has been hit by drought which has affected people including those from fertile areas. Bishop Panaritos Kimani says the current dry season is a lesson to the government and all people that the country needs to improve its food substance strategies. “The dry season has affected so many people including our animals. We need as a country to learn from this season so that we can come up with lasting solutions that we can produce enough for us, for sale and to store” he said. The church’s secretary general Gibson Mburu noted that the church has a project of assisting the poor and the needy.
