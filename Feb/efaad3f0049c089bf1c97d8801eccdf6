Normal school activities at St Stephen Kirindo Mixed Secondary School in Suba North constituency were halted after parents protested against dismal performance. The parents blocked the school gate with thorns and twigs to show their dissatisfaction with the school Principal Simon Ochieng. They accused him of dismal performance at the school and demanded his transfer. They also argued that many form4 candidates got grade Ds in the previous KCSE exams. Parent James Nyauke said they had tried in vain to have a meeting with the teacher and other stakeholders to get a way forward on how they can improve the school's academic performance. "The complaints had been raised to the area director of the education office but no action had been taken," he said. “Students who sit KCSE exams in the school always get grade D. Let him be transferred because he doesn’t add any value to the school." The parents insisted that the only solution is to transfer the principal. They want the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to move into action and transfer the teacher. “We’re writing to the TSC to transfer the principal to another school. His behavior is deliberate since he doesn’t want to meet us,” he said. Other parents accused the principal of mismanaging the school resources. “The headteacher has refused to call for meetings. Any time we want a meeting to discuss how resources are utilised he refuses,” he said. Efforts to get the head teacher for comments proved futile since he neither answered our phone call nor replied to SMS. The parents blocked the gate throughout the day to bar the principal’s entry.
