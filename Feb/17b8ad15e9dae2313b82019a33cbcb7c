Gospel singer Gloria Muliro has welcomed her first child. Gospel singer Bernice Mugo, alias Lady Bee, leaked the information during Ilagosa Wa Ilagosa’s requiem mass on Friday. Lady Bee was explaining why some gospel singers had to take time off their music careers. "Those ladies who have been mentioned. Gloria recently welcomed a baby, while Eunice is taking care of her family," she said, adding that family comes first. She added that people should also look at those artistes who are doing well after they quit the secular industry. "Size 8 also came and God has blessed us. I used to smoke weed and the gospel saved me," she said. "Ministry is not music but the power of God’s salvation." In November last year, Muliro celebrated her wedding anniversary with her husband Evans Sabwami. Gloria took to social media and described her hubby as her best friend. "Happiest Anniversary, my best friend, my moshene partner, my husband. Your love is a gift I open everyday. Here’s to you, here’s to us, here’s to many more happy years together. Happy anniversary, hun! I love you." The two tied the knot in a colourful wedding in New York in October 2021, six years after she divorced her music producer husband Eric Omba. The singer shared a photo of herself and her husband, captioning it, "Finally finally. My autumn wedding in New York."
