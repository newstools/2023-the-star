Sharon Kalunde Monica has promised to advocate for women's rugby and grassroot development as she seeks a director's position when the Kenya Rugby Union elections are called. The Sports Disputes Tribunal nullified the Union's elections from September last year following a protest by a section of stakeholders. This provided Kalunde and other interested parties to hop into the electioneering mood, targeting the various posts in the polls expected to start next month. Among the positions up for grabs include the vice chairman, secretary, treasurer and two directors. Kalunde, a long-serving Eldoret RFC secretary, said she has what it takes to serve the sport in a bigger role. “I have been the Eldoret RFC secretary since the team was playing in the Nationwide League and into the KRU Championship despite the numerous financial constraints we have had as a community club. I feel this experience puts me in a good stead to serve in this position (director's) well,” said Kalunde. Kalunde said she plans to establish women's team at the county level, targeting school leavers. “We currently have women's rugby in high schools but we don’t have a place for them to play after high school. There are no clubs to accommodate them. Majority lose touch with the sport after school,” she said. “Having successfully managed a men's team has motivated me to go for this post. I found the club when they were struggling in the nationwide, helped them to the second tier even without sponsors, save for a little help from a few individuals of goodwill." She added: “I know what it takes to run a club. The challenges a club faces especially community clubs where they need about Sh3m to afford a qualified coach, top players and to honour all matches. Our budget stands at Sh200,000." “I am hoping to help and develop rugby in the country. I don’t want to focus on women only but I love to see clubs and players growing in the sport from down up,” she added.
