Menses are part of the womanâ€™s monthly cycle. Just like the body requires the right clothes to look good, choosing the right sanitary towel, menstrual cup, or tampon is also crucial. Sanitary towels can be disposable or reusable and are used for 3-4 hours. Tampons and menstrual cups are inserted inside the vagina. Tampons absorb the flow and come in different sizes each with absorbency for heavier and lighter periods. Some tampons come with an applicator to guide them inside the vagina while others you have to use a finger to insert them. The menstrual cup is inserted inside the vagina and allows the flow to drip into instead of flowing outside the vagina. It comes with an instructional manual on how to use it. Settling on the best option among the afro mentioned depends on the following: Your period flow How heavy or light is your flow. Some ladies opt for tampons and menstrual cups since they have a heavy flow. Comfort Menstrual cups and tampons might be uncomfortable for some ladies so they settle on pads. But when choosing a pad ensure the brand that you use is not causing discomfort to your vagina. Choose a tampon size, menstrual cup size, or pad size that you feel comfortable in and it does not cause an allergic reaction. Financially affordable Period products can be expensive. Choose a product that does not affect your financial budget. Location Some ladies opt to use either of the three depending on where they are going to be. Ladies who swim prefer tampons over pads since you cannot swim when in a pad.
