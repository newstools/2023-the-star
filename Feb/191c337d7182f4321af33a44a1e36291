Culture and Heritage Principal Secretary Ummi Bashir has asked the United Kingdom to return historically significant Kenyan artefacts and documents. The PS, currently visiting the United Kingdom, is doing a follow-up on the return of African antiquities, particularly those from Kenya that are in the UK. She had earlier in the month made the same request to the United Kingdom on her visit to the Kenya Mission to the UK. The office of the Kenya Mission in the UK announced that PS Bashir had made the request. "The PS is in the United Kingdom to advocate for the return of historically significant artefacts and documents," they said. When the British came to colonize Kenya and many other African countries, they left with many artefacts that belonged to several communities. According to DW, until now, most of the debate about cultural assets from a context of colonial injustice has occurred mainly in the Global North. "But the discussion is also gaining momentum on the African continent," they said. In March 2021, the exhibition series "Invisible Inventories" was launched in Nairobi's National Museum. "The exhibition organizers addressed the question as to how cultural assets that are in Western institutions could nevertheless be made accessible to Kenyans," DW said. Artist Jim Chuchu has been a strong advocate for the return of looted art to Kenya by the colonialist. He said in a past panel that there is no moral right to question where these objects being asked for by African countries will be taken. "If you've taken objects, return them, don't ask where they're going to be put because these artefacts were taken from homes and communities in Africa and not museums," he said.
