Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Gladys Boss Shollei has vowed to deal with favoritism at the National Health Insurance Fund. Shollei claimed that NHIF only approves certain facilities and shuns others. "The challenge we have with NHIF is that they only approve certain people who are their friends," she said. The deputy speaker said you will find that one doctor has a million people in his clinic because he has been approved for NHIF while others who qualify are not approved. She was speaking as the chief guest at the one-year anniversary celebration of Mrya IVF Medical Center in Nairobi. Shollei said that NHIF must approve all the doctors who qualify and let patients choose where to go for treatment. "Now the problem is people are queuing with the same doctor because that doctor has been allowed to have a monopoly and that is what we don't agree with." "Believe me, that I'm dealing with. Leave it to me," she said.
