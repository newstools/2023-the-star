Police on Friday received a surrendered AK-47 rifle in Samburu in the ongoing operation to eradicate banditry and cattle rusting in the Northern area. Police said residents of the areas declared as "disturbed and dangerous" have continued to heed the amnesty offered for the surrender of illegal guns. "An Assistant Chief accompanied by a member of the National Police Reservist handed over one AK-47 rifle at Suyan Police Post in Samburu County," National Police Service said. NPS urged the public to cooperate with the security team during the ongoing joint security operation. On Tuesday, President William Ruto announced the start of a three-day voluntary disarmament exercise across six bandit-prone counties of Samburu, Turkana, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Baringo and Laikipia. He said there would be no repercussions for those who will surrender illegal guns within the amnesty period. Interior cabinet secretary Kithure Kindiki on Monday said marauding bandits and livestock rustling terrorists have brutally murdered over 100 civilians and 16 police officers in the Northern Rift Valley region. The CS imposed a 30-day dusk-to-dawn curfew in some banditry-hit areas to set the pace for the operation. The CS gazetted areas in six counties, including Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu, that would observe the curfew. In the order, there shall be no public gatherings, processions, or movements, either alone or as a group, during the period of the curfew except as has been permitted in writing by the Inspector-General of the National Police Service.
