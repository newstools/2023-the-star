A Facebook page that is purporting to be that of the second governor of Elgeyo Marakwet Wisley Rotich is FAKE. The Facebook page, “Hon Wesley Rotich” had asked its followers to send full names, ID number, phone number and county as he had 27 motorbikes to give out. “Good morning dear kenyans,Today have decided to offer new motorbikes to those who wants to start BODABODA business.. Today am giving out 27 new motorbikes to those people are interested in bodaboda business.This project is for Kenyans and the first 27 people to inbox their FULL NAMES ID NUMBER PHONE NUMBER COUNTY TYPE OF MOTORBIKE YOU NEED A IMMEDIATE DELIVERY,” he said The governor has since taken to his real Facebook account to flag the fake one, saying that people should avoid the fake one which is milking money from citizens. “Beware of conmen using my name in a fake account to fleece Wananchi. My Facebook page is verified, we are all subscribing to hustlers fund,” the governor said. The name of the governor is spelled as ‘Wisley’ and not ‘Wesley’ This fact check was published by The Star with support from Code for Africa’s PesaCheck and African Fact-Checking Alliance.
