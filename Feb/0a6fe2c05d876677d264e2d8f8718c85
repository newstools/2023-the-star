Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama celebrated the love she shares with her husband Barack Obama as the world marked valentine's Day. In a heartfelt message via her social media accounts, Michelle said she could not have asked for a better partner than the Former US President. "Happy Valentine’s Day, Barack Obama! I couldn’t have asked for a better partner to navigate life with. Love you!" she said. On his part, Obama described Michelle as his one and only. "Happy Valentine’s Day to the one and only, Michelle Obama. You make every day feel like an adventure." The couple has been married for 31 years. Barack and Michelle met in June 1989, got engaged in 1991 and were married on October 3, 1992. In his message during Michelle's birthday on January 17 as she turned 59, Barack said she made every day brighter. "Happy birthday, Michelle Obama. You make every day brighter - and somehow you keep looking better!" he tweeted. The couple is known to express their love without shying away. In November 2022, Michelle described her husband as her home, saying as an adult, she had lived in a number of places, but had only had one real home. "My home is my family. My home is Barack," she said. The 'Becoming' author said their marriage has never been a perfect 50-50, as one of them is always needing more or giving more. "We have to be willing to listen to each other, honestly and without defensiveness. Only then, can we evolve together," she said. "Over the years, a lot of young people have asked me about marriage. And my response usually goes something like this: You have to prepare yourself for long stretches of discord and discomfort."
