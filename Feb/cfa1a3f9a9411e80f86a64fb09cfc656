Southampton have sacked manager Nathan Jones after just three months in charge of the Premier League club. Former Luton Town boss Jones, 49, leaves with Saints bottom of the table after Saturday’s loss to 10-men Wolves. The Welshman lost nine of the 14 matches he oversaw in all competitions following his appointment on 10 November. That record included eight defeats in nine Premier League games and four successive home losses at St Mary’s. First-team coaches Chris Cohen and Alan Sheehan have also left the club, while lead coach Ruben Selles will take charge of Saturday’s Premier League match at Chelsea. Despite leading 1-0 with a man advantage on Saturday, Jones watched his side slump to a home defeat against fellow strugglers Wolves which was greeted with boos from the Saints fans at the full-time whistle. That came a week after chants of “you’re getting sacked in the morning” and “Nathan Jones, get out of our club” could be heard from away supporters during the defeat at Brentford. Speaking following that defeat at Brentford a week ago, Jones said he had “let the players down”. “I haven’t really put my own stamp on it and I should have by now,” Jones told the BBC’s Match of the Day programme. “I want to be brutally honest with this - I have let the players down.” Jones succeeded Ralph Hasenhuttl in November on a three-and-a-half-year contract after leaving Championship side Luton. He lost four of his first five matches in charge, with the only victory in that run a 2-1 EFL Cup win over League One Lincoln. But three wins in the space of a week over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup, Manchester City in the EFL Cup and Everton in the Premier League, then suggested Jones might have turned their fortunes around.
