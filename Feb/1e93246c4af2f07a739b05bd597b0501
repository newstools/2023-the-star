Nikita took to her Twitter to share a past video of Avril and fellow singer Kenzo Matata performing while she was lying in a hospital bed. "I’m sure she doesn’t know it, but I was one of them. I was star-struck and I have never forgotten it. Kind acts are never forgotten. Be kind," she wrote. Avril reposted Nikita's post, remarking that she never thought she was impacting someone that way. "God bless you @nikita_kering enjoy all the success you have now." In December, 2022, Nikita was featured on Spotify as their East African ambassador.
