Jubilee leaders from Nairobi have cautioned the Kenya Kwanza government against harassing retired President Uhuru Kenyatta. The group, which had been hosted by secretary general Jeremiah Kioni at the new party offices in Kileleshwa, told President William Ruto's administration to focus on delivering election pledges.  “The group warned the illegitimate regime to quit harassing Uhuru Kenyatta in his retirement and focus on delivering the promises they made during the campaigns and on lowering the cost of power, fuel and basic commodities,” the party said on Twitter. The group included Jubilee Nairobi officials and aspirants in the last election. They affirmed their commitment to Jubilee and Azimio La Umoja - One Kenya Alliance. On Tuesday, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka told Kenya Kwanza leaders to desist from targeting Uhuru in their attacks. Kalonzo warned that sustained attacks on Uhuru by top government officials could spew hatred among Kenyans. “The late President Moi did not speak ill against Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. The late President Kibaki also did not target Moi when he took over. When leaders appear to victimise Uhuru, you never know what might happen to the country,” Kalonzo stated. He recalled that some of Kibaki’s men wanted the government to repossess Moi’s Kabarnet home but their wishes were turned down. “In fact, Kibaki ordered Chris Murungaru (a former minister) to deliver a title deed to Moi. We must respect our leaders,” he said. He made the remarks at the home of the late George Magoha.
