Former president Uhuru Kenyatta has finally confirmed his stand in  Azimio La Umoja Coalition. Speaking in Kisumu on Saturday, he affirmed that he is still a member of the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party, despite his silence. "Kustahafu sio kuchoka… ata wengine wanastahafu na nguvu zinaingozeka.Ata kama nimewacha siasa active, mimi bado ni mfuasi wa babaAkiniambia twende lazima twendwe ,"Uhuru said. This translates to: "Retirement doesn't mean I'm tired. Others retire and increase their political strength," "Even though I have retired from politics, I'm still a follower of Raila. If he asks me we go we have to do it. I supported him and I will continue doing so because I believe he is truthful," Uhuru said. The Retired head of state further affirmed his support for Opposition chief Raila Odinga and insisted that he will support him. He explained that his support for Raila was because he had good intentions for Kenyans and whatever he says he will follow and support him. " I support Raila before the elections and I will still do it now because I believe he is a truthful person and wants to unite Kenyans," Uhuru said. "It's my democratic right to support whoever I want and it's not that I'm after any seat but where Raila will go, I'll be there," he added. Uhuru further added that divisive politics will not finish problems in this country. In what seemed he was taking a veiled dig at the current government,  which he suggested had not availed jobs for young people, lowered the cost of leaving and solved hunger problems among other issues bedeviling Kenyans. "What I know is divisive politics will not finish hunger.My prayer is that youths get employed and those facing hunger will get food," Uhuru said.
