Kenyan doctors say they are going to investigate GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) and make a recommendation to government on how to proceed. The Agriculture committee of Parliament is also investigating. Neither group should delay reporting. Last October the Ruto government  authorised the use of GMOs in Kenya although this is presently held up in the courts. GM crops are planted on over 160 million hectares in 29 countries, including the USA, China, Brazil and South Africa. There are no reports of unusual sicknesses of visitors or residents from eating GM foods there. Many countries, including Kenya some of the time, allow the importation of GM food crops because they are cheaper and reduce food costs for local consumers. Most Indian farmers voluntarily grow GM cotton because it reduces use of chemical insecticide and increases profits. Europe permits GM maize cultivation. The biggest risk of GM crops is profiteering by monopolistic multinationals like Monsanto. The health risk is minimal. Therefore the biggest protection for Kenyans is to ensure that farmers can choose for themselves whether to use traditional seed or whether to buy GM seed. Choice is good, monopolies are bad.
