Makueni senator Dan Maanzo has said that Deputy president Rigathi Gachagua is being honest that together with President William Ruto, they are running a company, not a government. Speaking on Monday, Maanzo said it is time Kenyans get to know "the kind of rulers we have now." He noted that the poll winners must embrace all but that is not the case for the Kenya Kwanza government. "First of all Deputy President Gachagua is very honest; theyâ€™re running a company but not a government. The Constitution of Kenya 2010, says that when you win an election you embrace everybody," Maanzo said in an interview on Citizen TV. "What they say in their mouths is not what is in their hearts. Kenya is for everybody but they say Kenya is for two tribes, those from Central and Rift Valley. Kenyans should now be aware of the kind of rulers we have now." He was reacting to remarks by DP Gachagua on Sunday, where he said the Kenya Kwanza government will reward its staunch supporters and those who toiled to put the current government in office and give the least consideration to members of the opposition. Gachagua who was speaking in Kericho said it was laughable that some members of the opposition had started trooping to State House seeking government positions. The DP said his role at State House is to ensure regions that backed them get development before those that did not. "This government is a shares company. It has the owners who have majority shares, those with minority shares and those that don't have any shares," Gachagua said. "You invested in this company owned by William Ruto and Rigathi Gachagua you must harvest. You invested and your time to harvest is now... Even they (opposition) will harvest, but they have to wait for you to finish harvesting." (Edited by Tabnacha O)
