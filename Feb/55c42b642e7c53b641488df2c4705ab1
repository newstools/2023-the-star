Tanzanian rising star Jay Melody is the writer behind Willy Paul's popular songs, 'Njiwa' and 'Kakololo'. Speaking to Mseto East Africa, Jay said he gave the song to Pozze since he did not have money to jump in the studio. Jay's music journey began at an early age, although he wanted to become a successful businessman because he believed that without connections, he would not get through Tanzaniaâ€™s music industry. "People started knowing me as a music writer first. I have done songs like, 'Hallelujah', 'Njiwa' for Willy Paul and 'Ndata' for Nadia Mukami," he said, adding that some songs have not been released. He said he did not release the song since he was still young in the industry. Jay said he gave Pozze a complete song, including the melody. "At that time, we did not meet with Willy Paul until I wrote for him the 'Kakoloni' song," he said. "I was still upcoming and it was business, so I needed to get money to start recording my songs." Willy Paul collaborated with Tanzanian singer Nandy on the two songs. 'Njiwa' has more than 21 million views on YouTube, while 'Hallelujah' has 13 million views. When the song was trending in 2018, Nandy said the song was her idea. In an interview with Mpasho, she said she refused Pozze's idea and gave him 'Njiwa', and he loved it. Jay is currently famous for his song 'Nakupenda', which has been trending on TikTok.
