The National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission has welcomed Supreme Court's decision to that it should be register by the NGO coordination Board NGLHRC said the decision marks the end of a decade-long legal battle that began when the Board rejected their application to register due to its name's reference to gays and lesbians. "Our struggle for recognition as an NGO underscores the importance of upholding the national values and principles of Equality and non-discrimination, particularly in protecting the Human Rights of marginalized groups," they said. Supreme Court judges said in their ruling that "given that the right to freedom of association is a human right vital to the functioning of any democratic society, we hold that this right is inherent in everyone." "Irrespective of whether the views they are seeking to promote are popular or not," the judges said. NGLHRC said they agree with the reasoning that members of the LGBTQ community have a right to freedom of association which includes the right to form an association of any kind. Njeri Gateru, NGLHRC’s executive director said that the affirmation by the Supreme Court is especially necessary at a time when the rights of the people who NGLHRC intends to protect are particularly threatened. "It emboldens our resolve as a community to agitate for a better Kenya for all of us," she said. NGLHRC lauded the Kenyan judicial system for consistently upholding the constitutionally enshrined rights. "This decision builds the confidence of an unpopular minority in the belief that the Rule of Law will be upheld," they said. They further thanked the LGBTQ+ community, partners, and allies who have stood with then throughout the long legal battle. "Your unwavering support has been instrumental in securing this victory, and we look forward to continuing to work with you," they said.
