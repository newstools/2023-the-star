Mkubwa Fella, a legendary Tanzanian music mogul and close associate of Diamond Platnumz's management, says he wishes for a collaboration between Diamond and Alikiba. While making a statement about the music industry, Fella told media that before he dies, he wants to see the two collaborate. "This will weaken the ones trying to bring beef between the two," he said. "Because we don't know where their beef started from. How do you start having teams against each other?" Diamond and Alikiba have been long-term rivals as their fans have also split into teams. The two superstars have wanted to be the kings of Bongo Flava music. Late last year, their beef was still blazing after Diamond's manager Sallam ranked him the top artiste 2022 and Alikiba seventh.
