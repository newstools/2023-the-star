Trans Nzoia Governor George Natembeya is skeptical that the voluntary disarmament exercise announced by government in North Rift will bear fruits. Speaking in an interview with Citizen TV on Monday night, Natembeya said very few people will surrender their firearms. "I want to assure Kenyans that within those three days, very few people will surrender their firearms if at all because each community will be waiting for the others to surrender first," he said. "Those who will surrender are those who have got many. Maybe you have six and you surrender one, that is useless." The governor said the banditry issue in the North Rift region needs the intervention of the military and not threats and directives without action. Earlier on Monday, President William Ruto announced a three-day voluntary disarmament exercise starting Tuesday. This will allow for the surrender of guns with no repercussions. He also ordered a joint security exercise between the National Police Service and the Kenya Defence Forces against banditry in the troubled region. Interior CS Kithure Kindiki also ordered all persons across the country holding illegal firearms and or ammunition to surrender them immediately and unconditionally within three days failure to which the culprits will meet the full force of the law. Kindiki, who was in Baringo, declared Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu counties as "disturbed " and "dangerous". This will pave way for the planned operations against the gunmen behind attacks hiding there. The order seemingly followed the killing of five people in Turkana's Kainuk area, including three police officers. Kindiki said the government has determined the security situation currently prevailing in the Northern Rift Valley region as a national emergency. "Accordingly, painful and decisive measures must be taken effective immediately," he said.
