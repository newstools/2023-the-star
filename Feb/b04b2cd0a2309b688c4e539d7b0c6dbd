Individuals seeking to undertake any activity in basic education institutions will have to be vetted first, Education CS Ezekiel Machogu has said. The cabinet secretary said the scrutiny aims at protecting teachers and learners from influences that violate the cultural norms and traditions the education system seeks to nurture in learners. "If we allow anybody to access our schools, it will be a mess," Machogu said. He made the remarks during a consultative meeting with members of the clergy drawn from the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) and the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB). ACK Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit had asked the Ministry to protect learners from harmful influence from some NGOs who work in some schools. He said some of the organisations sneak culturally offensive ideas into otherwise well-meaning programmes for the development of the learners. Among those present during the meeting in Machogu's office on Wednesday were Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang, KCCB chair Bishop Paul Kariuki, University Education and Research PS Beatrice Inyangala and her Vocational and Technical Training counterpart Esther Muoria. Machogu thanked faith-based organisations for the support they continue to offer the public education sector. He said the church has educational institutions which have benefited thousands of children across the country. Machogu said the Ministry will work with the clergy in establishing chaplaincies and guiding and counselling in schools. He said chaplaincy and guidance and counselling will help mitigate the problem of drug abuse and other evils that affect students in schools. Bishop Kariuki said the Ministry should formulate guidelines that will require schools to set up school rules which recognise religious liberties.
