Thika Queens coach Fred Majani has cited a change in training methods as the reason behind the team's resurgence in the Football Kenya Federation Women's Premier League this season. Thika look like the team to beat after a run of five straight wins that has propelled them to third on the log with 18 points just behind Gaspo on goal difference. Vihiga Queens are top of the table with 19 points. Thika, who's title defence went up in smoke last season after finishing fourth, have already brushed aside defending champions Vihiga Queens 4-1 and floored down Gaspo Women 5-1 to lay bare their title intentions. "When I came in this season, the confidence of the players had hit rock-bottom. They needed a lift in their spirit and a mentality shift," Majani observes. "On the training ground, we focus on pressing and retrieving the ball as quickly as possible once we lose it. That normally suffocates our opponents and becomes easy for us to play and win." Thika are rebuilding after losing the spine of their 2021 title-winning side. "It has taken time to gel and get the chemistry among the playing unit right. We have given the juniors a chance and the fruits are evident. We don't care who we meet, whoever comes we will deal with them accordingly. Wins against Vihiga and Gaspo has brought the mojo back." Thika's Wendy Atieno tops the goal-scoring charts with 10 goals while teammate Chris Kach boasts of seven. Juliet Andipo has stabilised the defence, which leaked easy goals last season while Georgina Mulati anchors the midfield. Thika take on Kayole Starlets this weekend before ending the first leg fixtures with a clash against Zetech Sparks. "I am impressed with the strike force. They have been scoring for fun. We will put Kayole to the sword. We have the chance to go top of the log because Vihiga still have a date with Gaspo," he said.
