Martin Kasavuli, son of the late TV presenter Catherine Kasavuli, has penned an emotional tribute to her one month after her demise. Through Kasavuli's Instagram page, Martin says not a day goes by that her mum is not missed. Martin said it has not been an easy month. He praised his mum, saying she was the best mother any son would have asked for. "I thought it might get easier as time went by, but it does not. I do not know how to come to terms with reality, but I know that you, for sure, are the best mother a son could ask for in so many ways," he wrote. The prominent news anchor died on December 30 after battling cervical cancer. Martin added that his mum taught him how to live life to the fullest, promising to keep her legacy. "You saw beauty in everything in life. You were a very simple-minded human being. You were the best person morally that I have ever known." During her memorial service a day before her burial, Martin described his mother as jovial, stylish and the coolest ever. Martin said his mum loved people and on several occasions, he met strangers in his mother's hospital room. "Even as cancer robbed her of her health, her infectious smile was always on her face when I visited her at the hospital," he added.
