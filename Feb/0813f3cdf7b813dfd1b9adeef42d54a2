Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen has urged the East Africa Community to collaborate in building the region's transport and communication network. Speaking during the 18th meeting of the Sectoral Council on Transport, Communication and Meteorology (TCM) in Bujumbura, Burundi on Friday, Murkomen pointed out that transport played a key role in enhancing regional integration. "The transport sector is both the driver and enabler of regional economic growth," he said. To enhance economic growth and the regional development, he said the EAC needs to take into action the decisions and directives made by higher policy organs. "There is, therefore, urgent need for partner countries to adopt a broad-based consultative approach in the formulation of policies and programmes and fast-tack the implementation of infrastructure projects that would support the transport sector." During deliberations, the Ministers agreed to take up the COMESA Road User Charges in the partner states. This is aimed at supporting transporters. Further, they agreed to have applicable rates displayed at One Stop Border Posts (OSBP), to help travelers to plan ahead. While delivering his speech, Murkomen also shared President William Ruto's message. Ruto pledged continued support for regional integration as a pathway for ease in trade. Present were ministers from the EAC partner states including Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and a representative from the Republic of South Sudan. Others were officials from the EAC Secretariat, the Civil Aviation Safety and Security Oversight Agency (CASSOA), the Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC), Inter-Governmental Standing Committee on Shipping (ISCOS), Central Corridor Transit Transport Facilitation Agency (CC-TTFA), East African Communications Organization (EACO) and Northern Corridor Transit and Transport Coordination Authority (NC-TTCA).
