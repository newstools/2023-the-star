Azimio leader Raila Odinga should not have used his position in AU to criticise Kenya Kwanza while on tour of African countries, Nyaribari Chache MP Zaheer Jhanda has said. Jhanda said it was a matter of when and not if Raila was to exit the AU as the High Representative for Infrastructure Development. “Odinga cannot use International platforms as AU envoy while on his tour of duty to countries like South Africa, Nigeria among others to criticise the Kenya Kwanza Government,” he said in a statement. The MP claimed Raila never wrote to AU Chairperson Moussa Faki to be relieved of his duties. “The announcement of his termination of duty at AU caught him by surprise and he had nothing to say and hence gave a flimsy excuse.” Jhanda said the Azimio leader should have resigned from AU immediately after Kenya Kwanza Government took over the leadership of the country. The end of Raila’s tenure at AU was made in an announcement by Faki in a letter dated February 19. In his letter, Faki commended Raila for his leadership in leveraging infrastructure as a key priority in the continent, stating that his role in the journey has been invaluable. Reacting to the letter, Raila said he was asked to be relieved of his duties due to his “continued unavailability.” “During our meeting on the sidelines of the 2nd Dakar African Infrastructure Financing Summit in Dakar, Senegal about three weeks ago, I indicated the challenges to my continued availability for the role of AU High Representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa. In that regard, I welcome your quick action that will free me to pursue other pressing and urgent matters,” he said. Raila was appointed to the position in October 2018, as part of AU’s drive to expedite the integration of the continent through infrastructure, in order to promote economic growth and sustainable development.
