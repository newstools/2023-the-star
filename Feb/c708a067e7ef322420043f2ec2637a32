Ulinzi Starlets head coach Joseph Wambua is hoping to use the weekend break to sharpen his striking following dismal displays in their recent encounters. Wambua said his strikers have been misfiring to the leave team sixth on the log with 13 points, same as Wadadia a slot lower. "I have good strikers and all I need is to strengthen their ability on the ground," Wambua said. Among the strikers at the club are Joy Kingilady, Patricia Amose, Mercy Ayiro, Lanoline Aoko, Linda Auma and Silia Rasoa, who is currently unavailable through injury. Wambua said he won’t dash to the market for strikers but would rather improve his current attackers. “I am not rushing to the market. I want to improve on those strikers in the team and I believe they can do better. I will only go to the market if need be,” Wambua said on the phone. Initially the head coach had decried poor performance of the team due to poor striking force. On the other hand the Vihiga Queens head coach Boniface Nyamu Nyamu said his charges will be using this break to heal from the injuries that have decimated his squad. "I am happy for this break. It will help some of my girls recover from their various injuries," said Nyamu Nyamu.
