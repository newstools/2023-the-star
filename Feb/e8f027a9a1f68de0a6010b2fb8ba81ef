Raila Odinga and former president Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday arrived at the Kisumu Uhuru Business Park for a rally. The ODM was also accompanied by Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyongâ€™o', MPs Otiende Amollo, Samuel Atandi, Joshua Oron and Miller Adhiambo. Speaking during the rally, Raila cited the high cost of living saying Azimio had a full plan. He said whatever was promised had not been fulfilled. The ODM leader said those who want to leave ODM should do so. "We won't entertain traitors. We are unstoppable and moving forward," he said. According to the ODM party, Uhuru and Raila will make stopovers in Luanda market and Kisumu town. Suspended Jubilee party secretary general Jeremiah Kioni who also attended the rally said the journey that was started by Uhuru and Raila was still on and they would support them till the end. This, Kioni said, will ensure Kenyans are saved from the problems they are currently facing. Raila has been holding public rallies which he has described as public Barazas to reportedly consult them on the next actions after their victory was 'stolen'. On Friday, Raila held a rally in Mavoko, Machakos county attended by top Azimio leaders including Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka. More rallies are planned this week as the former prime minister builds what he has termed as resistance against President Ruto's administration.
