Commonwealth and African 100m champion Ferdinand Omurwa Omanyala is optimistic that he will clinch the gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary later in the year. Speaking after clocking a world leading 9.86 at the Nyayo Stadium during the Athletics Kenya track and field meeting, Omanyala said only time can stop him this year. “The level of fitness I have so far is so good that nobody can beat me. This time, it is me against the time. I want to run all the way to the top as I continue to lower my time,” said Omanyala, the Africa 100m record holder. “I want to win the Diamond League trophy now that I am improving day by day since starting my season with the indoor tour, where I won many events." National 100m and 200m record holder Maximilla Imali was in top form after running the fastest time in the heats. Imali ran 11.31 to win Heat 5 ahead of Ugandan Jacent Nyamahunge (11.59) and Doreen Waka (11.89). Nancy Cherop won the women’s under-18 3,000m race to book a slot in Team Kenya to the Eastern Africa youth and junior championships to be held at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania next month in Tanzania. The Form Four student at Chelebei Secondary School in Mount Elgon won the race in 9:05.67. “It has been good for me to win this race since it has secured my Team Kenya debut. I want to try my best and bring a medal from Tanzania,” said Cherop. Fresh from winning the Sirikwa Classic Cross country under-20 title, Samuel Kibathi won the 5,000m title after posting the fastest time in one of the most competitive races of the day. The national under 20 champions won the title after posting 13:36.02 in Heat 2 of 5 in an event that attracted 175 runners. Cornelius Kemboi was second in 13:36.53 as Gedion Rono completed the podium in 13:37.85.
