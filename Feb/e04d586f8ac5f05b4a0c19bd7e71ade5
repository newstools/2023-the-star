Thika Queens' head coach Fred Majani has vowed to topple the current Kenya Women's Premier League champions Vihiga Queens this season. Majani said his girls are determined to get the trophy at all costs. "We are physically fit and I don't see what will stop us this time round. We must win our remaining three matches, " he noted. The coach said he is currently left with Kangemi Ladies, who they play on Sunday, Kayole Starlets, and Zetech FC. “We are not that bad. The girls have been improving by the day and looking forward to a maximum of nine points in the remaining three matches,” Majani said. He said he has only one injury and that is a good sign and he embarks on his mission to bring Vihiga down. Three teams Gaspo, Thika and Bunyore are all tying on 15 points—a point adrift leader Vihiga Queens who top the table with 16 points. Vihiga have lost their last two matches—a move which head coach Boniface Nyamunyamu has attributed to injuries. ​N​yamunyamu revealed that five of his players are down with injuries including goalkeeper Dianah Tembesi, defender Ruth Kasoa, Felistus Kagahi, Pouline Achieng and captain Mercyine Wayodi among others. He said Tembesi is out for two weeks while Kasoa will take six weeks on the sidelines. “At the moment, we are in a bad position because of the injuries. I am not sure if I will manage to raise the first eleven for the next Wadadia match,” Nyamunyamu noted. He said with the match against Wadadia only two days away at Mumias Complex, he is not sure of raising the full squad as he only has only eight players on the ground training," he added.  Wadadia are currently seventh on the log with 13 points.
