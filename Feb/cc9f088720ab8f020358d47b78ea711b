The county government of Kakamega has disbursed Sh13.3 Million to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise traders in a move aimed at boosting their businesses. The launch of the disbursement program took place at the Kakamega county headquarters and was presided over by Governor Fernandez Barasa on Tuesday. The governor revealed that plans are underway to train Women, People with Disabilities and youths from across the County on the choices of ventures with high returns to enable them to make the most out of the funds. “The objective is for them to be trained on how well they can effectively put the funds to use and make good returns to enable them to stay in business with a steady income," said Barasa. The program is among the strategies put in place by the county government to ensure the realization of the pillar of wealth creation for the people of Kakamega County. The ultimate vision of the Kakamega County Microfinance Agency is to have an established bank in the region, a dream the governor said was well on course. “We want to put in every effort to ensure businesses here receive all the needed support to grow our spur our local economies and to also realize our dream of establishing our own bank as traders. We shall keep injecting funds to realize that dream,” said Barasa. The governor also used the forum to direct Sub-County Agricultural Officers and Sub-County Administrators to prepare for the upcoming distribution of the County's subsidized Mavuno fertilizer and maize seeds in readiness for the planting season. The county government is issuing the fertilizer to farmers at reduced costs of Sh.2900 per 50 kgs bag in a move geared towards ensuring the county’s food security. Framers are to register their respective Ward Administrators for the County subsidized fertilizer and certified maize seeds.
