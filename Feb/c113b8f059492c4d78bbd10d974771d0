Nduru Man, the TikToker who trended after screaming former President Uhuru Kenyatta's name outside State House, has been unwell. He has been missing from social media for some time. In a recent interview with Obinna, he said he has been ailing and not jailed. "I've not been good but I'm good," he said. "People have been asking where I went, no one knew, so I stopped doing this stuff of screaming.. "I don't like to publicise my problems, even though I'm that kind of guy, even when I'm broke, I will never come and ask Kenyans to donate money." Seven months ago, he said he took a break after he was arrested after screaming at President Ruto's former residence in Karen.
