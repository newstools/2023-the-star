Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Thursday announced they have organized a national prayer day for youths to shun drugs and help the country recover economically. In a tweet on Thursday, the DP said the prayer service will be held on Sunday, February 12. Gachagua made the revelations after meeting Governors from the Rift Valley Region who called on him to brief me ahead of national prayers for our nation as the hosts. He said the prayers will be a thanksgiving to God for a peaceful election and smooth transition. "Religious leaders will also lead the nation in praying for rains. Prayers will be offered for a fast economic recovery as well as for saving our youth from illicit brews and drug abuse," Gachagua said in a tweet. "The clergy will also pray for the healing of the nation, from the scourge of cancer, and for peace and security for all communities to live together in harmony." This was after the governor from the region paid him a courtesy call at the Harambee Annex Office for briefing. The prayers will be held on Sunday, February 12, 2023. Gachagua said President William Ruto will lead them. The day has been dedicated to thanking God for a peaceful election and smooth transition, Gachagua said, adding that all Kenyans are invited.
