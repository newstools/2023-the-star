A Kirinyaga county employee was among six suspects arraigned before a Gichugu law court on Wednesday after being caught in possession of elephant tusks. Samuel Murimi together with Patrick Njogu,Christopher Gatimu, James Mwangi, Peter Mwendia and Eliud Kinyua denied the charges. The suspects were charged with dealing in wildlife trophies contrary to the Wildlife Conservation Management Act. They were charged that on January 19, 2023, within Kimunye shopping centre in Gichugu, they were arrested while ferrying two elephant tusks in a Prado at 1 pm. The 4.5 kg wildlife trophies that were nabbed from the suspects are worth a street value of Sh2.95 million. The accused through their lawyers pleaded to be released on bond or bail citing that they remain innocent until proven guilty. However, their prayers were vehemently objected to by the prosecution on account of the grave nature of the charges. “I have read the six pre-bail reports all six accused are said to have a permanent place of abode. It is also apparent that there are residents within the county and each is well-known to the local administration. None of the accused has prior records and other antecedents,” reads the ruling in part. The accused were each released on a bond of Sh1,000,000, a surety of a similar amount or alternative cash bail of Sh500,000. The case will come up for mention on February 17, 2023.
