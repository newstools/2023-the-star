Youth Affairs and Arts PS Ismail Maalim Madey has urged parents to nurture children's talents and encourage them to leverage social media to earn money. While speaking at the launch of KFCB's Digital Parental Literacy Programme on Tuesday, he said the internet is a door to improving socio-economic statuses. "Besides ensuring child online safety, parents can take a keen interest in children's unique skills and talents," he said. "The internet indeed presents opportunities to nurture those talents," he added. The PS said that many Kenyans use the internet and social media platforms more as a tool of entertainment rather than to earn money. "We need to really end that kind of thinking and tell the youth to seize these opportunities," he said. He said that the creative economy is one of the key drivers of the digital economy in Kenya. "The Kenya film industry directly employed between 1000 to 9824 people in 2019. Also, about 4 to 5 per cent of the country's total employed workforce in the same period came from the audiovisual sector," he said. This contributed an estimatedÂ  Sh14.07 billion to the country's GDP. "It is the government's conviction that the creative economy is a low-lying fruit that can be leveraged to improve the livelihoods of the youth through job creation and income generation," he said. He said they will work to spur the development of the creative economy to grow and they have embarked on the development of a creative economic policy. "Let us, therefore, work together for a safer internet in line with the theme of the year's safer internet day," he concluded.
