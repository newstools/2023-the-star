Vihiga Queens' head coach Boniface Nyamunyamu has hailed his charges for ensuring they remain at the top of the table despite injuries. Vihiga Queens secured three points against Wadadia after beating them 1-0 at Mumias Complex. Lorna Atere’s 32nd-minute goal kept the Kenya Women League champions in contention after a number of dismal performances in their recent matches. Nyamunyamu said despite critical injuries in the squad, he is happy that his girls still punched above their weight to earn maximum points. Following Saturday's win against Wadadia, Vihiga still tops the league with 19 points with Gaspo second with 18 points. “I know it's not a good moment for my team but I am still optimistic I will retain the title,” Nyamunyamu said. Meanwhile, Zetech head coach Bernard Kitilo has blamed poor defending for their dismal show against Bunyore Starlets at Cambridge Stadium. Zetech shared the spoils with Bunyore following a 2-2 draw. “My target was to win the match but our opponent Bunyore had other plans,"  Kitilo said. He added: “Bunyore are definitely a team to watch and they are the next big thing. Despite displaying our best soccer, they still went on to return home with a point,” he added. Bunyore Starlets' assistant coach Absalom Mariga said one point from Cambridge is a plus for his side, recalling that they had lost at the same venue last season. “The last time we were at Cambridge last season,  we lost 2-1. A draw this time is an improvement,” Mariga said. He assured that they are not far off from challenging for the title if their performance is anything to go by.  “We conceded two goals in the second half due to windy conditions," he revealed. Thuren Alukwe and Mercy Njeri scored for Zetech while Mary Ambila and Lucky Achando were on target for Bunyore. Meanwhile, Ulinzi Starlets head coach Joseph Wambua attributed their defeat to a blunt striking force. The tactician said his side had chances to win against Gaspo but failed to utilise them.
