Chemelil Sugar Company in Kisumu on Wednesday paid cane transporters and harvesters Sh7.9 million. Of the amount, Sh6.5 million will go to transporters and Sh1.4 million to harvesters. The payment is for the week ending February 5. Interim managing director Jacqueline Kotonya said operations in the company are going on as usual. The daily crushing capacity of the factory is 3,000 tonnes of cane. Kotonya praised the continued support from farmers, transporters and cane harvesters to the factory. She urged suppliers to deliver canes to the factory to sustain the milling operations. “We are appealing to suppliers to continue supplying the company with canes to sustain the milling operations,” Kotonya said. This, she said, will ensure the desired sugar production levels and revenues to meet the expectations of all the stakeholders. The company resumed production after undergoing three months of maintenance on August 28, 2022. The Sh220 million government-funded maintenance was undertaken between April and July this year. The money was to service and procure various key components that ran the factory. Kotonya replaced former acting MD Gabriel Nyangweso. This was after the Employment and Labour Relations Court directed Agriculture CS Mithika Linturi to appoint a new MD. Linturi was further directed to advertise for the recruitment of a new board of directors following a successful petition by Caleb Gichana who sought the removal of the officials from office.
