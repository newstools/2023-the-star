After missing representing the country at the World Athletics cross country championships that were concluded last Saturday in Bathurst, Australia, Marion Jepngetich came out guns blazing with victory at East Africa Under 20 championships trials held at the Nyayo stadium. The young runner from Kamwosor Athletics Club in Elgeyo Marakwet county won the 5,000m women's race to book a slot at the East Africa Youth championships that will be staged next month in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. “After missing the chance to run for Kenya, I did not lose hope but I went back to training more for this event and I thank God that I have won," Jepngetich said. "God gave me strength because I had cut the team for World cross but I missed the visa and decided that I will not lose. I kept training harder and it has given me a win,” said Jepngetich. She said that she wants to feature at the regional championships next month to prove her worth on track and improve on time. “This season I want to represent Kenya at the East Africa athletics championships. But my main focus is to improve on my time which I am targeting at 15:42 in 5,000m,” she said.
