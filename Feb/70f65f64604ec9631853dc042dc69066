Parents, guardians and caregivers are using the internet less than their children. This is according to Kenya Films and Classification Board (KFCB) Acting CEO Christopher Wambua. Wambua said that a study by UNICEF in 2021 found that this lack of exposure to the internet limits their ability to guide children appropriately on internet use and safety. Wambua said that the knowledge gap on internet use among parents is very disconcerting as they know little of the danger posed by the internet. "Two-thirds of internet-using children had not been taught how to stay safe online," the study further said. 57 per cent of children had shared their personal information with strangers, while 42 per cent reported having accessed sexual images or videos on their media feeds. "16 per cent of children had actively searched for sexual-related content online with 33Â  per cent inadvertently accessing such content," the study found. It is for that reason, he said, the board has launched the Digital Parental Literacy Programme for parents. "Basically, the reason why we're doing this is there's a knowledge gap among parents for some features that are embedded on the platforms that our children are accessing," Wambua said. They partnered with Google, TikTok and Netflix so that parents can be guided and equipped to be able to children to make the best out of the internet. "We intend to take these messages, these programmes in the residential areas, to the churches and town halls to reach every parent across the country," he said. He told parents that art, through online media, is a powerful tool that shapes character and thus it should be carefully regulated for children and other audiences.
