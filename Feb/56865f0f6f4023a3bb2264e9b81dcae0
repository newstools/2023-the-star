Gaspo goalkeeper Valentine Khwaka became the first goalkeeper in the Women's Premier League  history to score from open play as they beat Wadadia 3-1 on Sunday. Khwaka hit a 90-yard goal kick that skipped past Wadadia goalkeeper to make it 2-1 in favour of the Kiambu County-based side in a match played at Stima Club. Gaspo Women chairman Edward Githua, who was the team manager last season said it was good to see Khwaka score. He termed it a lucky goal since the goalkeeper had no intention of finding the back of the net. "Wadadia keeper adjudged the movement of the ball and it flew past him. The ball bounced over and went to the far post," Githua said. "I believe she is the first goalkeeper to score from open play which is good but we cannot brag. It was a lucky goal for her considering her role in the team." Gaspo have a date with Vihiga Queens in a top-of-the-table clash this weekend. Gathua said they need to turn things around against Vihiga, who they have found it hard competing against lately. "Mumias is a tough place to visit. We have won just once against them and our performance need to improve." Following the weekend results, Vihiga still top the 12-team standings with 22 points from 10 matches. Thika Queens moved to second on 21 points by virtue of superior goal difference against Gaspo, who dropped to third. Nakuru City Queens remain fourth with 17 points while Ulinzi moved to fifth after humiliating minnows Kangemi Ladies 7-0. Kayole Starlets, who are pointless in ... matches anchor the table.  This weekend's matches will see the WPL season hit halfway point.
