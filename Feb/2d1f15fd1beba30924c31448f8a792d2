Former Education Cabinet Secretary Geroge Magoha's widow Barbara Magoha has said her husband ate her food until the last day. Speaking during the funeral service in Gem, Siaya, Barbara said for the 40 years they were married, she never let her husband down. "As a wife, I supported him, no body else made my husband's food, I was so busy but whether I was in the country or not, it is my food that he ate," she said. She also said mourning her husband the best way she knew was the best thing to do. Social Media users had criticised her for dancing while mourning her late husband. Barbara had on Wednesday received the body of her late husband at their Nairobi Lavington home while dancing to Nigerian tunes. "My husband died aged 71 years, he has lived his life, I was celebrating a life well lived, that's how we do it in Nigeria," she said. Nigerian culture was on display, as she dressed in her traditional regalia. During Magoha's requiem mass on Thursday at the Consolata Shrine, Barbara recounted the last moment of her husband. "He was ok, he was not sick, we talked. On January 24, we went to buy things for our late brother's funeral," she said. But at 2 pm, she said Magoha told her he was 'chesty' and at 2:30 pm, he asked for a cough mixture. "I told him to rest, as he was stressed. I showed him my cough syrup and walked away as I was preparing for work," she said. "My professional career was something of importance to him."
