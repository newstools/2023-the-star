Nyashinski's wife Zia Bett says a week before her sister, Janet Bett- Karoney, died, God prepared her for the demise. Janet died on October 18, 2021, after battling a blood disorder called aplastic anaemia. In an Instagram Live with her other sister Diana, the rapper's wife saidÂ God talked to her through a dream. Diana also said she had taken a day off to pray for her sister. "God said to me, I don't want you to pray for healing. Pray for peace over her mind and that she will be comfortable in her last day," Diana said. The two sisters said doctors had also told them there was no hope. Zia said Janet had also texted her that her chances of living were low.
