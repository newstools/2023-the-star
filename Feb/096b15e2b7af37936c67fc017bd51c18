Vanecious Nasimiyu Wanjala, 14, from Kaptanai village in Sirisia constituency in Bungoma is appealing to well- wishers to help her raise fees to join Form 1. Nasimiyu sat for her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education last year and scored 345 marks, but risks missing her Form 1 slot as her single mother has nowhere to get money. Nasimiyu attended Kaptanai Primary School. In an exclusive interview on Friday, Nasimiyu told the Star she risks missing out on achieving her goal of becoming a doctor. “Since primary school, I've been very determined to become a doctor after I complete my secondary education, but it seems impossible as up to date I haven’t joined Form 1,” she said. She is facing stigma from her village colleagues. “My friends who learn at nearby schools laugh at me when they see me staying at home,” she said. She applied for the Bungoma county and Elimu scholarships but she did not succeed. “My friends whom I accompanied to apply for the scholarships were confirmed and they are currently in school. Please, anybody listening to me help me get to Form 1,” she said. John Mutete, the deputy principal at Kaptanai Primary School, confirmed that Nasimiyu was her student saying her mother is unable to raise fees for her. “Nasimiyu has been here since Class 1, she has performed well up to KCPE,” he said. Nasimiyu was selected to join form one at Ahero Secondary School in Kisumu county. Maureen Nyongesa, her single mother, appealed to area leaders to help her daughter join Form 1. She parted with her husband 15 years ago. “My husband divorced me after we had a misunderstanding. I have lived a miserable life with nobody to support me,” she said.
