More than 3000 needy and vulnerable secondary school students in Karachuonyo got relieved after the constituency office gave them bursary cheques worth Sh17.163 million. The majority of them come from poor and less fortunate families. The National Government Constituency Development Fund distributed the money to 3,767 students. The students are in both day and boarding schools. Karachuonyo MP Adipo Okuome and area deputy county commissioner Aaron Koross said the money is also going to help the government achieve the 100 per cent transition. The cheques were given to principals. Okuome said his office received reports that some students especially the poverty-stricken families had already stopped going to school because they lack fees. “We have teen girls who got impregnated. The findings reveal that they cannot afford an education without the intervention of external stakeholders,” Okuome said. Speaking in Kendu Bay town, the MP said they prioritized giving bursaries to the students to make them productive people in future. He said it is only through education that the constituency can achieve development in future. “Society has an oblique future if we don’t educate our children. What we want from the students is to work hard and achieve academically,” the MP said. Selection of the students was done by extended families at various villages to ensure only those who deserve benefit. The strategy ensured that needy students are identified without discrimination. He asked the students to focus on education and become important people in future. “Let the students know that society relies on them for their contributions to development in future. They must work hard in school,” he said. Koross also warned people who impregnate teen girls. “Teen pregnancies and shortage of school fees are the biggest hindrances to achieving 100 per cent transition in the area. Let’s work together and ensure we address the problems,” Koross said.
