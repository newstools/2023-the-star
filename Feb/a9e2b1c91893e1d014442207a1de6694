Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has filed a proposal at the Senate to amend the Act that exempts Kenya's first President Jomo Kenyatta and his successor Daniel Moi's families from estate duty levy. In a letter dated February 1 and addressed to the Clerk of the Senate, Cherargei proposed that the section be changed. "This section should be replaced by inserting the following words "that this section shall not apply to the disabled, minorities and marginalised as provided by the relevant law," the letter reads. The aforementioned Act is in section 7 (3) of the Estate Duty Act CAP 483. Cherargei is seeking to have the original wording deleted for the above statement. The original states, "This section shall not apply to HE Mzee Jomo Kenyatta or HE Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi". The families have been roped into the raging debate on tax exemptions and evasions. Ruto on Monday, without directly mentioning names, said some people who were in power used state instruments to avoid paying taxes â€” something he said will not happen on his watch. "Every citizen must pay tax. It doesn't matter even if they sponsor demonstrations so that they don't pay tax. I promise them they will pay tax. There is no more exemption," he said. He added, "This country is not the animal farm where some are more equal than others. We are going to have a society where every citizen carries [his or her] fair share of our burden to raise taxes." On the same day, four citizens sent a petition to Parliament seeking to repeal the provision exempting the families from paying estate duty levy. The Star established that the petition was first served in Parliament in 2021 at the height of the Uhuru-Ruto fallout but did not see the light of day. The four argued the section of the Act infringes Article 210 (3) of the Act that compels all state officers to pay taxes. The families are yet to comment on the same.
