Political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi has criticised chief opposition leader Raila Odinga over his calls for President William Ruto to resign. In reference to Raila's 'Ruto Must Go' calls, during the Azimio protest rally on Sunday, Ngunyi wondered where to. "Ruto Must Go. Go where? Go back to Statehouse in 2027? This is the only thing that Babaman can stop," he said. Addressing his supporters at Kibra on Sunday, the Azimio leader listed reasons why Ruto is not fit to be the President of Kenya. He maintained that the 2022 general elections had been rigged in favour of Ruto and that the Azimio team had won. He added that Ruto had made false promises to create a 'mama mboga' government, only for him to unveil a "government of billionaires". Raila went on to fault the government for abandoning its promises of lessening the high cost of living, saying Kenyans had been rewarded with the most "I don't care" administration. The Azimio leader pointed out that Ruto and his Kenya Kwanza allies had failed to provide Kenyans with a solution to deal with inflation. "Ruto found our people with a little in their pockets. Now that little is being taken away," Raila said in reference to tax increment. The ODM leader urged Kenyans to exercise their rights and duty to reject the Ruto administration. He added that Azimio was committed to serving Kenyans. "We will. That is the Azimio declaration. That we will put into place a government that cares for the interests of the people," he said. In his statement on Monday, Ngunyi however wondered how Raila was going to stop Ruto from the presidency in 2027. "And the question is this: Can he? The answer is: "...You cannot use an old map to find new lands.."
