Kitutu Chache South MP Anthony Kibagendi wants Parliament to order an audit into the just concluded teachers' recruitment exercise. The MP claimed that the recruitment of primary and secondary school teachers across the country was marred with improprieties that need to be examined. The lawmaker alleged that he has evidence that the recruitment was skewed to benefit certain communities at the expense of minorities. Kibagendi said he will be moving a motion in the National Assembly to compel the House to order a comprehensive audit of how the Teachers Service Commission recruited teachers across the country. “The recent TSC recruitment of teachers was marred with corruption. Two communities have taken up 50 per cent of the 36,000 slots as if the rest of Kenyans don't pay taxes,” the MP said. Regretting that most qualified teachers were left out despite meeting the criteria as provided for by the TSC, Kibagendi said a thorough audit will expose the extent of the rot in the recruitment. “We shall soon be exposing the extent of the unfair distribution of these job opportunities meant for Kenyans,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. The MP suggested that the probe be expanded to include the recruitment in the country's security agencies including the Police, the Prisons Service and the Kenya Defence Forces. “This country belongs to all of us,” the MP said. TSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia has previously said the recruitment of teachers is above board and looks at merit only. She told a parliamentary committee last week that the commission ensured that only deserving Kenyans who merited were hired during the just concluded exercise.
