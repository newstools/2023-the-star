Early learning and Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang has dismissed the alleged shortage of Grade 7 teachers in primary schools. Kipsang who was speaking on Friday said the commission has been training teachers progressively. "Teachers are always prepared to handle any curriculum. The whole principle of teaching is still there despite the change," he said. Kipsang was responding to concerns raised over the delayed deployment of teachers. TSC is yet to complete the posting of teachers for Garde 7 who were interviewed in 2023. "We have been building the capacity of our teachers since 2017, and we have been on CBC for six years," he said. The commission had revealed plans to retool the newly hired teachers and send them to schools by January 30. TSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia said the teachers who were already trained will retool the newly hired teachers. “We target to train 90,000 teachers between January and April,” Macharia said. All interns who have been serving in 2022 will be absorbed to be permanent and pensionable teachers. This is according to a memo signed by TSC director of staffing Joseph Mugele dated January 11. "The interviews for the exercise commenced on Friday, January 13 and recruitment documents are scheduled for February 6," the memo reads. The director requested that the interns should not be removed from the payroll. This, he said, would help in waiting for their employees under the new terms. In a statement in December, the commission said 10,000 of the teachers will be employed on permanent pensionable terms while 25,550 will be intern teachers. It said 9,000 of the slots are for permanent secondary school teachers and 1,000 for primary school teachers while 21,550 slots are for intern teachers for Junior Secondary Schools. The Commission said another 4,000 intern teachers will be hired for primary schools.
