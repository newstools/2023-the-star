Two vehicles were on Thursday night burned after they burst into flames on impact following a collision in Machakos town. Machakos subcounty police commander Moss Ndhiwa said the vehicles include a 40-feet trailer and a saloon car. Ndhiwa said the incident happened between Shell and Rubis filling stations on Kyumbi-Machakos road, a few metres from Susu Centre. "The two vehicles burst into flames following a road accident. We are trying to put it out," Ndhiwa told the Star on phone on Thursday night. He said the incident happened a few minutes past 8 pm. "We aren't able to give details now, let's put out the fire first. I will give details thereafter," the police boss added. Police and members of the public were at the scene helping in putting out the fire.
