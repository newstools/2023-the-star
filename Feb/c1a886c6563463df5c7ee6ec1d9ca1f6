A former deputy principal will today be arraigned to face murder charges following the death of a student at her school in 2019. Elizabeth Gatimu is a suspect in the murder of Ebby Noelle Samuels, a Form 1 student then, at CCM Gatanga Girls Secondary School, which has since changed its name to St Anuarite Gatanga Girls Secondary School. Ebby died under mysterious circumstances in March 2019. The school had claimed that she died after falling from her bed at night. However, a report by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations revealed the girl was assaulted severely by a teacher, on allegations that her hair had been styled contrary to school regulations. An autopsy would later reveal that Ebby bled to death after she was hit with an object on her forehead, breaking her skull and causing internal bleeding that eventually killed her. Gatimu was then arrested and arraigned at the High Court in Kiambu. The judge directed that a mental test be conducted to ascertain the suspect's fitness to stand murder trial. At the Milimani law courts in Nairobi, the trial of six police officers for the murder of two Kianjokoma brothers in 2021 will also proceed with hearings before Justice Daniel Ogembo. The six police officers charged with the killings are Benson Mputhia, Consolata Kariuki, Nicholas Cheruiyot, Martin Wanyama, Lilian Chemuna and James Mwaniki. Among those who have testified in the case are the deceased's parents. "They were wonderful boys, very industrious. I have never had any issues with them, they were ready to take on the world,‚Äù the father, John Ndwiga who was the first to testify said.
