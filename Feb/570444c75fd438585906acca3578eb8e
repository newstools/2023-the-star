Vanessa Mdee has revealed that she is expecting a baby girl. She shared a video of her fiance Rotimi playing around with her baby bump. "Our Princess, already daddy's favourite girl," she captioned it. The couple shared a video of pink flowers flowing off a black umbrella. "Baby No 2. Glory to God… It’s a girl." The couple already has a son, Seven Akinosho. When asked why the children have a one-year gap, Rotimi said he grew up an only child. "I want my son to have someone he can count on, that he looks to his left and he knows they are going to be there for him," he said. "Someone she looks at her right and she knows she has an older brother who is going through the same thing at the same age."
