Governors have received a big boost in their development plans after the National Treasury allocated them Sh44.3 billion grants in the next financial year. The allocation is Sh7.3 billion more than the amount they were allocated in the current fiscal year. Treasury has already allocated the counties Sh385 billion in equitable share, pending Parliament's approval. In the County Government Additional Allocation Bill, 2023, the counties have been allocated Sh5.86 billion for the leased medical equipment scheme. This is compared to Sh5.68 billion allocated in the current financial year. This implies that each county will get Sh124.72 million for the programme, which has been controversial since its inception in 2015. The contract for the seven-year project elapsed in December last year and governors are expected to sign fresh MoUs to allow for an extension of the contract. Governors and other players in the medical field have raised concerns about the cost of the project, with reports indicating some equipment is gathering dust in some counties. “Additional grants shall be funds agreed upon by the National Assembly and the Senate during the consideration of the Budget Policy Statement,” the bill reads. In the draft bill that has been sent to the Senate by Treasury CS Njuguna Ndung'u, counties have also received Sh4.7 billion for establishment of industrial parks. Each county will get Sh100 million for the integrated programme. Five counties will receive Sh454 million as supplement for construction of their headquarters. They include Isiolo, which will get Sh60 million, Lamu (Sh48.84 million), Nyandarua (Sh121 million), Tana River (Sh121 million) and Tharaka Nithi (Sh103.16 million). Ten counties will receive unconditional grants from court fines amounting to Sh108.66 million. “Each county treasury shall reflect all transfers of conditional allocations by the national government to the respective county government in its books of accounts,” the report reads. All the 47 counties will also get a share of the Sh33.19 billion additional funding from proceeds of loans or grants from development. This is compared to Sh17.15 billion they received in the current fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. The allocations include Sh3.15 billion from World Bank for the implementation of the National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Project and Sh8.25 billion for the National Agricultural Value Chain Development project. The World Bank will also advance Sh2.16 billion to the counties for the Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture project and another Sh5.35 billion for the Water and Sanitation Development project. Counties will also get Sh577.5 million grant from Danida for primary healthcare in Devolved Context. Some Sh517 million will also be advanced by the World Bank for Financing Locally-led Climate Action programme and Sh72.79 million from Sweden for Agricultural Sector Development Support project. The devolved units will also get Sh765 million from the German Development Bank for drought resilience programme in Northern Kenya. The World Bank will avail Sh2.30 billion for emergency locust response project and another Sh3.26 billion for Kenya Informal Settlement Improvement Project. The counties will get Sh344.30 million for Kenya Livestock Commercialisation Project and Sh245.87 million for Aquaculture Business Development Project.
