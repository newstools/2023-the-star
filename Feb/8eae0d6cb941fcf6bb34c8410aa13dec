A joint committee of the Senate and National Assembly will vet Central Bank of Kenya deputy governor nominee Susan Koech and submit a report to the House before March 9. National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula said the vetting shall be conducted by the Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning of the National Assembly jointly with the Standing Committee on Finance and Budget of the Senate. “As contemplated under Rule 9 (6) of the Joint Rules unless a decision is reached by consensus, any vote to be taken in the joint sittings of the committees shall be by separate Houses,” Wetang’ula said in a communication to the House. He said this will ensure that the numerical difference of the individual members representing the Houses in the joint sittdoes not affect on the decisions of the joint sittings of the committees. President William Ruto picked former Wildlife PS Susan Koech as the second deputy governor of the Central Bank of Kenya. Koech holds a doctorate in business administration from Moi University. She was the Nairobi regional head at KCB Group before joining the government. The hiring of the second deputy governor will correct a concern recurrently raised by the Auditor-General. The law says the executive team at the CBK be composed of the governor and two deputies. Retired President Uhuru Kenyatta ignored calls for the CBK to have two deputy governors during his term.
