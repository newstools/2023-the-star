Narok Senator Ledama Olekina has expressed his gratitude towards ODM Party leader Raila Odinga for his new role at the senate. Ledama said that he will deliver as expected by the Azimio la Umoja One Alliance. "Thank you Azimio One Kenya Alliance and Raila Odinga for the trust! We will deliver without any fear or favouritism for our people whom we serve at their pleasure because all the powers belong to them," he said.  On Wednesday, Opposition chief Raila Odinga announced changes in the Senate leadership. In the changes announced, Ledama is the new Minority Whip taking over from Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo. Nairobi senator Edwin Sifuna is now the deputy minority whip replacing Ledama. The opposition coalition retained Steward Madzayo and Enoch Wambua as the minority leader and deputy minority leader respectively. The changes came afterÂ  Raila met Azimio senators in Nairobi. The meeting sealed the fate of the 'rebel' Jubilee senators who were part of the team that pledged their allegiance to President William Ruto. On Tuesday, the Azimio senators kicked out Senators Fatuma Dullo (Isiolo) and Margaret Kamar (nominated) from the powerful Senate Business Committee.
