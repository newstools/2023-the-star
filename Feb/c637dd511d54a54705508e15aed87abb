Willis Raburu will walk his fiance Ivy Namu down the aisle this year. Raburu engaged Ivy during their son's birthday in 2022. At the time, he said wedding plans were underway. "There is going to be a wedding after the baby comes," he said. Speaking in a recent interview in the segment #CandidWithYvonne, Raburu said the wedding will happen in 2023. "This year, there will definitely be a wedding," he said. "Anytime between January and December." Raburu separated from his first wife Marya in 2020 after their church wedding in May 2017. A few months ago, Marya Prude said she regrets getting married at the age of 23 years. "I don't know what I was thinking!" She said she wasted time serving society and other human expectations of her being a wife.
