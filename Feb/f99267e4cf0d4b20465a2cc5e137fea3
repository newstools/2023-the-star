Doctors and other medical practitioners in Kiambu county will on Friday hold protests at the governor's office where they will present their grievances. In a letter to the Kiambu Town Central Police station, the Kenya Medical, Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) asked the police to provide them with sufficient security during the peaceful protests. "This is to inform you that the healthcare workers tomorrow, February 10, 2023, will be having a peaceful demonstration from Kiambu Level V Hospital to county assembly and to the governor's office starting from 9.30 am," the letter reads in part. "The aim of the march is to register our discontent and present a memorandum detailing issues that the county government needs to act on immediately to avoid further action. Kindly be informed accordingly and provide security as envisaged in the Public Order Act," it added. This is the second time in four months the medical practitioners in Kiambu county are under a strike threat. On September 20, 2022, the health workers in Kiambu threatened to down their tools to protest a two-month salary delay. The healthcare providers accused Governor Kimani Wamatangi's administration of being insensitive to their plight.
