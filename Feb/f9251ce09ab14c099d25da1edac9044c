University of Nairobi Terrorists’ two weekend victories can help spur the team away from relegation, coach Eugene Genga has said. Genga said the 51-50 and 52-49 Kenya National Basketball League wins against Kenyatta University Pirates and Equity Bank Dumas respectively is a sign of progress. “It means a lot and serves as a morale booster and shows that we can compete in the league. Hopefully, it will serve as a springboard to many more wins,” said Genga. UoN are still eleventh with 22 points behind KU and Lakeside who have 23 points but have played two and three games more respectively. Genga said there are some new systems he has been employing in his practices and they seem to be bearing fruits. He noted: “Our defence kept us in the game by enabling us to build a lead. We forced difficult shots, rebounded well and this fuelled our transition to offence.” Genga said he still has three more games against University teams in Zetech, Africa Nazarene and Strathmore and hopes to get results to further their quest for survival. “These (games against university sides) can go either way. We also have fixtures against mid-tier teams, Umoja and Thunder, which are tricky games.” He said they have already turned their focus to their next match against Umoja, promising to give it their all.
