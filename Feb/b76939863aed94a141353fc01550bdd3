'Kishash' hitmaker Jeremy Maina well known as Lil Maina has lost his grandfather. Maina made his name after posting a video while jamming to a Jamaican song in front of his grandparent who was seemingly unbothered. Through his Instagram page, Maina paid tribute to his grandfather saying things will never be the same without him. He described him as the best grandfather thanking him for raising him. Maina was raised in Mombasa but moved to Nairobi in order to live with his grandparents which ultimately birthed his comic stunts. "I don't know what to say, babu, I will always have you in my heart. It is not the same without you, it will never be. The best grandfather to me and to everyone. I will miss you so much. Thank you for making me who I am today. Thank you for the support, and thank you for raising me. I love you, babu. Till we meet again. I never wanted to post anything about this, but I thought it would be good for you guys to know," he emotionally penned. In a past interview, Maina credited his talent to his maternal family. He noted that he started posting in 2018 but didn't imagine that the videos would gain wide traction across the country as well as internationally. His social media pages capture several videos in which Maina pulls pranks on his grandparents and hilariously goofs off. Maina also became famous after his song 'Kishash' where he raps about intimacy in the back of Ubers, teenage depression, and smoking weed.
