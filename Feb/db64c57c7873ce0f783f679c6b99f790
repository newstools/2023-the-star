Kakamega County Water and Sanitation Company (KACWASCO) has started a ‘Green Movement’ to conserve and protect its water sources and water catchment areas. The Movement seeks to plant 10, 000 tree seedlings every year in line with President William Ruto’s initiative for the government to plant 15bn trees to address the devastating effects of Climate Change. The company’s main water catchments are the Yala catchment which hosts the main uptake at Tindinyo on the foot of Nandi escapements and Bunyala Forest. “As a company, we remain at the forefront in matters of environmental conservation because we shall not have water to supply if we leave the catchments to be destroyed,” said acting Chief Executive Officer Christabel Ashiono. She said the initiative will include the community to ensure ownership and sustainability of the initiative to improve forest cover in the county. “We will be planting fruit and indigenous trees that have benefits to the community and environment. It is our appeal to the community to be at the forefront to support us in this exercise,” she said. Ashiono said that the trees will be planted around its water treatment facilities, water catchment areas, water sources, schools, hospitals and churches. County Environment, Natural Resources and Climate Change Justin Mutobera said the county is set to mount a public sensitisation campaign on the importance of conserving the environment and protecting water sources. “It is time to make positive impact on our environment to address climate change. Either way, the buck stops with us,” she said. Governor Fernandes Barasa announced that the county will plant 300, 000 trees this financial year in line with President Ruto’s clarion call to increase the forest cover.
