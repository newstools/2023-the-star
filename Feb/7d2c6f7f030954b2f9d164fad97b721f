Police in Teso North subcounty in Busia had a rough time on Tuesday trying to calm down a mob that wanted to burn a chief’s office. The mob had gathered outside the Aboloi chief Ben Tonje’s office to see a suspect they claimed was involved in cattle theft. The suspect had been arrested in Mayanja, Bungoma, before being driven to the chief’s office. The arrest followed the stealing of a cow belonging to Henry Imoite in Aboloi on Monday. Tonje said after the incident, Imoite, through the administrator’s advisory embarked on a search mission for the cow in neighbouring markets where residents suspected the animal may have been sold. “The owner of the cow went to Mayanja market for a search and hours after he left home I received a call from the market chairperson saying the cow had been found and one suspect arrested,” Tonje said. “After being brought to my office, residents gathered outside my office to see the suspect.” Tonje said the residents wanted the suspect handed over to them to lynch him. "We had to call reinforcement from Malaba police station to calm the situation after residents turned chaotic. They claimed they had lost many cattle as a result of theft," he said. However, when police from Malaba arrived, part of the chief’s office had been damaged. Window panes to the office were broken as the mob tried to force itself into the office. However, police from Malaba managed to repulse the residents before the suspect was moved and driven to Malaba police station. “I want to warn those who are fond of stealing that the law will catch up with them. We are vigilant and anybody who wants to gain from where they did not invest, their days are numbered,” Tonje said.
