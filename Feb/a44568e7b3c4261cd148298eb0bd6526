Jubilee secretary general Jeremiah Kioni has said that the former President Uhuru Kenyatta has chosen to remain silent on state issues. Kioni said Uhuru has a constitutional right to be vocal but it is his own personal choice to remain silent. Speaking on Tuesday, Kioni said that Uhuru is a gentleman and Kenyans may not have understood him. "If he was to move around campaigning or agitating for change that would make the country very unstable," he said during an interview at Capital FM. "There are alot of attacks on him, insults towards himself and the family and we must commend him for keeping his cool." However, Kioni said Kenyans should not underestimate Uhuru because he has a following. He said about 30 to 40 per cent of Kenyans still support the former President. Uhuru has been seemingly quite after he handed power to President William Ruto. The former President also serves as the Jubilee party leader until 2026. However, he has been quiet on party matters, with Kioni taking the centre stage. Some party members have since pledged alligience to Ruto and promisedÂ  to work with him.
