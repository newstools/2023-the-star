A Librarian from one of the popular schools in the capital has been charged for indecently touching a 10-year-old girl. The offence was committed on February 9 when the minor had gone to the library to get a storybook. The accused person is said to have hugged the girl immediately after she arrived at the library and tried to kiss her. The girl got scared and moved some steps away from him. A female teacher then entered the library and the girl ran to her narrating the ordeal. The class teacher referred her to the deputy head teacher's office where the matter was taken up. The issue was raised with the police and the accused person was arrested and arraigned. He denied the charges before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. He was released on Sh200,000 bond with a cash bail of Sh100,000. The case will be mentioned on February 28 for a pre-trail.
