Ugandan singer Eddy Kenzo says his Grammy nomination has given hope to everyone. Kenzo is nominated for Best Global Music Performance. "I can’t express my feelings. It is like I am dreaming. This nomination should give hope to the underprivileged," he told AFP. "Even the poorest and the humblest can make it. If I made it, they can make it as well." The 33-year-old singer says his dream is to make people happy. "When one dances, he or she becomes happy, feels good, laughs, feels loved, shakes off stress and forgets depressing issues of the world," he said. "I also wanted to become a beacon of hope for those in despair that, regardless of their current predicament, anyone can make it in life." Kenzo is up against big names including Burna Boy and Nomcebo.
