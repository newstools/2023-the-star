Former Nyalenda MCA Jacktone Ojwang Ogendo has denied claims that he assaulted Kileleshwa MCA Robert Alai in Kisumu on Sunday. This is after police in Kisumu started investigating an incident where Alai reported being assaulted by Ojwang. The allegations were reported at the Kisumu central police station and booked as an ‘assault of a VIP incident.’ “Alai reported that Ojwang head-butted him leaving him with a slight cut on his forehead," the police report reads. According to police report, the motive of the assault was not immediately established. However, speaking in Kisumu on Tuesday, Ogendo noted that it was Alai that threatened him with his gun at one of the hotels within Kisumu after they were from the Azimio rally in Busia. “He removed a firearm from his waist and threatened me, so far what I know is that Alai has reported that I assaulted him but actually he is the one who threatened me," Ogendo said. Ogendo said he will also record his statement on the matter at the police station.
