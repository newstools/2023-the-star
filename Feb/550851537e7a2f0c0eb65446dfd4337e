Luanda MP Dick Maungu has said he will ensure sanity in that sector without favouring any region. The lawmaker, who is a member of the education committee in the national assembly, said he has realized there are so many crafty games ongoing in parliament. The MP decried the poor distribution of teachers in the Western and Nyanza regions by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC). “There has been total unfairness in distributing teachers in the Western region which as a member of the education committee I will hold Teachers Service Commission into account,” Maungu said. “County like Kakamega is facing a shortage of 6000 teachers while Vihiga County is facing a shortage of 1500 teachers and a county like Kirinyaga is facing a shortage of 47 teachers,” he posed. “Is TSC doing justice to us?” he questioned. Maungu was speaking at Luanda constituency where he was commissioning a Lunch program for all 57 primary schools for only class eight pupils. “Their employments have been done on poor plans and well-trained teachers from Counties within the Western region are yet to be employed,” he said The MP said due to that, he urged the TSC to employ teachers and keep the data per sub-county so that all constituencies benefit from these 30,000 slots. “And when I leave back to Nairobi I will head direct to TSC offices as a member of the Education Committee and demand the data for all teachers employed by TSC from all five sub-counties of Vihiga and I will counter-check with all Vihiga leaders,” Maungu said. The lawmaker said such chances when they come to Vihiga people should benefit at least 80 per cent if not 100 per cent.
