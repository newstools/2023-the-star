Basic education PS Belio Kipsang has denied there was cheating during the 2022 KCSE exams. Kipsang said teachers may have had early exposure to some exam papers but there was no leakage. He spoke when the department appeared before the National Assembly Education committee on Friday. “Teachers may have had early exposure to the second paper done at 11am, but I can tell you with certainty that no leakage happened in the first paper,” Kipsang said. The PS said the ministry and the examinations council have put in place tight measures to deal with early exposure of the second paper. “This year 2023 examination we have a firm plan on how to deal with early exposure,” he said. This is even as Education CS Ezekiel Machogu, PS Kipsang and Knec officials were summoned in a twin probe into alleged cheating in the 2022 KCSE exam begins in Parliament. The top Education ministry officials will face Senate’s Education Committee to explain the widespread claims that the exam was marred with irregularities.
