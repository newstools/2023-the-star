Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua has called on Kenyans of goodwill to offer material support to the people of Turkey and Syria affected by earthquake. While addressing the media, Mutua said the support includes clothing, foodstuff, financial and medical supplies to alleviate human suffering. "We cannot just sit, watch TV and talk about what's happening in Turkey, we have a responsibility to lay a hand to these nations," he said. Mutua said the government is looking at a way of getting tea, coffee and even nuts to the countries. "We will be communicating about the collection points in the next two days, I urge religious organisations to pray and to also collect a special offering to help the countries," he said. The former Machakos governor said no Kenyan has so far been affected as a result of the earthquake. "So far we do not have Kenyan affected and we are keeping our fingers crossed, anyone facing distress or has been affected can call 905385020960," he said. He was accompanied by Turkish Ambassador Subutay Yuksel. On February 6, Turkey declared a state of emergency and urged people not to use mobile phones to allow rescuers to coordinate. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck in the early hours of Monday and dozens of aftershocks have been felt in the hours since. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a three-month state of emergency in 10 provinces affected.
