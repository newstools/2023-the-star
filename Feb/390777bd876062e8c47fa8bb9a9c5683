Mumias East MP Peter Salasya on Tuesday threw a jibe at former Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala following his appointment as UDA secretary general. While congratulating him on the big job at the country's ruling party, Salasya thanked him for leaving the Amani National Congress, a party affiliated with Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi. He said Malala's move is making way for the existence of only one western region party. "Congrats my brother Cleophas Malala for your new appointment as the SG of the ruling party. Thank you so much for telling bye-bye to ANC party,   you are on the right track to ensure we have only one party in western Kenya, DAP Kenya led by my party leader Eugene Wamalwa," Salasya stated. Malala ran for the Kakamega governor's seat on an ANC party ticket but lost to ODM's Fernandes Barasa. On Monday, UDA announced Malala as its new SG, taking over from nominated Senator VeronicaÂ Maina. In the changes, Embu Governor Celily Mbarire was named the new chairperson of the United Democratic Alliance Party. She replaced former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama who resigned from the position. The changes followed UDA National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held on Monday. The region has previously been associated with ANC which was led by Musalia Mudavadi before he became Prime CS, Ford Kenya which was owned by National Assembly speaker Moses Wetang'ula and the Democratic Action Party of Kenya owned by Eugene Wamalwa.
