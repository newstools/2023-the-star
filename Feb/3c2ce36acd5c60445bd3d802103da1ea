A 23-year-old woman who is alleged to have killed her one-and-a-half-year-old son was arraigned on Monday. However, Jane Wamucie did not take a plea as detectives had not finished investigating her case. Instead, the investigations officer police constable Evans Onyango from Lari DCI sought for 15 days to complete recording statements from the witnesses. Onyango told Limuru senior principal magistrate Jared Magori that they also want to take her for a mental assessment. The detective told the court that, Wamucie went to her parent's home on February 13, and was asked by her parents where her son was. However, they were not content with her explanation and suspected that she had lied to them. Onyango said they reported the matter at Kimende police station where she gave a different story, forcing the officers to refer the case to DCI. The detective said when they took over the case, they interrogated her and on February 17, she took them to a pit latrine of a plot where they lived and she revealed to them that she had killed and dumped her body inside. Onyango said they called the fire brigade experts who retrieved the body and they took the body to Uphome Funeral Home where an autopsy will be conducted. Magori accepted the DCI request and ordered Wamucie to be detained at Lari police station, as the detectives finalise their probe. The magistrate also ordered the case be mentioned on March 8.
