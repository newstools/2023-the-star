Police in Kakamega have recovered a stolen motor vehicle with an altered registration number plate. The vehicle was stolen at Migosi in Kisumu Central subcounty. Kakamega county police commander Joseph Kigen said the vehicle was recovered at Mukumu in Shinyalu subcounty on Wednesday. The vehicle of registration number had the number plate altered slightly by changing the last letter from K to L using white and yellow stickers. This, investigators said, was the trick those stealing cars are using to conceal or alter the number plate of stolen vehicles. He said the car had a tracking and cut-out system which enabled the owner to switch it off. The recovery was done through a collaborative effort by police officers from Khayega police station and Kondele police station. Kigen said the car was towered to Kondele police station in Kisumu where the DCI team is probing the matter. The public has been advised to consider installing a tracking and cut-out system in vehicles to reduce cases of car theft. Residents praised the police for swift action in recovering the vehicle.
