The head of Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), Martha Chizuma, has been suspended over a leaked audio in which she made comments that could potentially prejudice people accused of corruption. The audio leaked more than 12 months ago with President Lazarus Chakwera describing it at the time as "corruption fighting back". He also suggested that the audio was being circulated to force him into sacking her. Ms Chizuma remained in the job with the presidentâ€™s backing and went ahead to indict several high profile officials, including Vice-President Saulos Chilima and a cabinet minister, on various corruption-related charges. They denied any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, her suspension was announced by the secretary to cabinet, Colen Zamba, but some legal experts have questioned the protocol used. President Chakwera's office has not commented on the suspension.
