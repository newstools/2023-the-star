A section of leaders from Kisii county have appealed to opposition leader Raila Odinga to shelve his planned countrywide rallies. Led by former Governor James Ongwae, who spoke in Kisii town on Sunday afternoon, they said Raila should recognise William Ruto as the duly elected President and give him an opportunity to fulfil his five-year contract with Kenyans. Raila was scheduled to address a rally in Kisii on Monday, but it has been pushed to Friday. “For those planning orchestrated rallies across the country and want to do the same in Kisii, I urge you to reconsider your moves. Accept that the time for politicking is over,” Ongwae said during a press conference at St Vincent Pastoral Centre in Kisii. He was accompanied by former nominated MCA Jane Justine, Josephine Ombati, Kisii Boda Boda chairman Fred Nunda, Kisii Contractors Association chairman Ken Mariera and secretary Hoffman Ondieki, among other leaders. Separately, former Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi led other UDA leaders in scoffing at Raila’s rallies. "We tell him that this is not the time he should come here to instigate incitement against the government. We have already decided to put politics behind us and work with the government so that our people can get development,” he said. The leaders asked residents to give the ODM leader's visit a wide berth as it is of no political good to the region. "Mr Odinga must leave us alone as Omogusii to chart our political future. It should be noted that none of the so-called demonstrations has been held in Luo Nyanza. Why is he misusing other areas?" Maangi posed. Kisii assembly whip Bouse Mairura said Raila should respect those in power and stop seeking handshakes from every presidential candidate winner.
