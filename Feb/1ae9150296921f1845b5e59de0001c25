For afro hairstyle, there is a period where your hair is not that long and itâ€™s not too short either. Some struggle with getting a good salon for their hair so they opt to style it at home. Maintaining afro hair might be easy or difficult, but it all depends on you. However, whether you decide to style your hair at home or in the salon, avoid manipulative hairstyles. Keep in mind your hair type and its porosity. You can have your short/long hair in either of the following styles. Wash and go As the name suggests, you wash your hair, style it and go. It requires you to have a good hair care routine. Puff This requires your hair to be long, or your Afro to be big. Then you need a large head tie and moisturizing products. Moisturize your hair and comb it out into an afro, then using the head tie, pull your hair from the front to the back and across both ends to where you want your puff to be. Tighten the head tie using its ends. Twist outs In this, you use two strands of your hair sections to achieve a twist out.

Protective styles These include bantu knots, cornrows, twists, and braids. They give your hair time to grow to minimize breakage and help it to retain moisture.
