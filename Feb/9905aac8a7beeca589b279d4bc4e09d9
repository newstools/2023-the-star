Governor Ken Lusaka on Wednesday hosted a team from the Korea International Cooperation Agency to discuss how the organisation will support a water project. The delegation was led by its country director Janghee Im in Bungoma county. In a meeting attended by the Deputy Governor Jenipher Mbatiany and Water Executive Herbert Kibunguchy, they evaluated the progress of the second phase of KOICA Chepyuk-Kibabii complex water supply project. The project, which is currently 50 per cent complete, has seen 86.3km water supply pipeline installed, all structure works at the intake, erection of water treatment plant of 6000m3 and a construction of 800m3 reservoir tank at Kimukungi Primary School completed. The team will now embark on the construction of 25 water collection kiosks across Mt Elgon, Kabuchai and Kanduyi constituencies. More than 100, 000 Bungoma residents are set to be connected to safe drinking water once the project is complete. Governor Lusaka expressed his gratitude to the Republic of Korea through KOICA for supporting water projects in the county. He extended an invitation to KOICA for consideration of the county in the phase three of water supply complex project to cover Kimilili, Tongaren and Webuye East constituencies. KOICA country director expressed his gratitude to the Bungoma county government and it residents for the cooperation regarding the project, hinting at it being complete by August. “We are certain the project will be complete by August where majority of the residents are set to benefit from the project,” he said. Bungoma county assembly Water Committee chairman and Luuya/Bwake MCA Edwin Opwora assured the residents of constant flow of water once the project is complete. “Our residents will have constant flow of clean water once this project is complete hence sorting the perennial challenge of inadequate water in most homes,” Opwora said.
