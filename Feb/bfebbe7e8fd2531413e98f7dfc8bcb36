Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) has proposed an allocation of Sh15 billion for the expansion of the farm input subsidy programme. In a report, PBO said the allocation would be key in transforming the agriculture sector as President William Ruto moves to address the country’s high cost of living. The report, “Fiscal Consolidation amid a Global Recession, what is the magic?” said the allocation should target 200,000 metric tonnes of subsidised fertiliser and other assorted farm inputs. “Restructure the e-voucher input management system to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in the supply of farm inputs,” it advised. PBO’s Budget Options for Financial Year 2023/2024 explores policy options that the government can consider to achieve fiscal consolidation in a way that does not harm economic growth. This includes focusing more on productivity increases and efficiency in the use of resources and empowering the private sector to drive economic growth. In the report, PBO said the government should make an allocation of Sh1.5 billion for the provision of extension services and another Sh300 million to ensure the full implementation and operationalisation of the Warehouse Receipt Systems. “Provide Sh200 million for procurement of mobile grain driers or grain drying centres and cold storage systems at the community level, especially where Warehouse Receipt System is not accessible,” it said. PBO said each county should allocate Sh50 million annually towards investment in small-scale irrigation infrastructure in the agricultural zones. The office further proposed the provision of Sh7.2 billion as credit or working capital to farmers through well-managed farmer organisations or cooperatives and another Sh3 billion as a subsidised loan product specifically designed for the production of key food staples for the Strategic Food Reserve.
