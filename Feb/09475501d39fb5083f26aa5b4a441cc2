Your lipstick choice affects how you look in your outfit and make-up. It can make you pop, or make you dull. Just like when choosing an eye shadow, the lipstick you choose is essential to complete your everyday look. Know your skin tone and undertone Knowledge about your skin tone and undertone will come in handy when choosing your lipstick. This will help you choose a lipstick that compliments both. Size and shape of your lips Your lips size can either be heart-shaped, round, thin or bow-shaped. Each shape determines the lipstick you will wear. When it comes to the shape of your lips you can have asymmetrical lips, the lower lip being heavy, or the upper lip being heavy. The colour of your hair Keep in mind that your hair colour, your skin tone, and your undertone match, so if your hair is dyed then choosing a lipstick that suits you might be dependent on your undertone. Eye colour Your eyes can be black, brown, blue, green, or grey among other colours. The colour of your eyes refers to the colour of your iris. As you apply your lipstick remember to keep it off of your teeth.
