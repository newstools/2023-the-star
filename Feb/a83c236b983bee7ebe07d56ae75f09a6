Villagers in Pokot Central Sub-County recovered and surrendered three firearms to police following a meeting with elders. The weapons included a Bren gun recovered from Loyapat Village in Turkana South. The other two firearms, an ARX-200 Barreta, and an FN were recovered in Amarel Sub Location within Pokot Central Sub-County. Similarly, in Baragoi, the Deputy County Commissioner Samburu North Sub County received an AK47 Rifle with one magazine loaded with three rounds of ammunition (7.62x39mm), surrendered by a member of the public, police said. This comes ahead of a planned operation to disarm those illegally armed in the area. President William Ruto announced a three-day voluntary disarmament exercise starting Tuesday, February 14. This will allow for the surrender of guns with no repercussions. Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on Monday said marauding bandits and livestock rustling terrorists have brutally murdered over 100 civilians and 16 police officers in the Northern Rift Valley region of Kenya. The operation is set to start on Friday, February 17.
