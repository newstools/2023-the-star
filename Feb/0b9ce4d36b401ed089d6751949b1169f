Wiper Party has told off the Kenya Kwanza administration over attempts to 'buy' their members to support the government. In a statement on Sunday, the Kalonzo Musyoka-led party said the President William Ruto-led administration has made several attempts to break the Azimio coalition, in vain. They accused Kenya Kwanza of trying to return the country to a single-party state. "In an effort to legitimise their fraud, the Executive has made many attempts to divide the Azimio-One Kenya coalition. "They have openly used public institutions and resources to entice individual members "in the name of development" to break ranks with their political parties. "They have systematically tried to erode all the gains of multiparty democracy and take this nation back to a one-party state," the statement reads. The party insisted that they are firmly in the Azimio coalition and fully support the Azimio People's Barazas. The statement followed a two-day retreat held in Naivasha. Wiper further accused the government of continuing to lie to Kenyans even as the situation in the country continues to worsen. "Today, mama mboga cannot pay rent, the boda boda can barely fuel their motorbikes, our farmers have maize rotting in the silos yet this government is hellbent on feeding Kenyans with GMOs, "The average mwananchi is being overtaxed and overburdened, unemployment is on the rise, Kenyans are losing their lives to senseless violence and the state of insecurity is alarming. Enough is enough."
