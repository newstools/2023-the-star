A video that has circulated on Social Media of High School students being bullied did not happen in Kenya. A Twitter user by the name VOTERS BEWARE  had alleged that the students were form one learners who have joined the school and were experiencing bullying. "Hey DCI Kenya, bullying in High Schools should be treated like Banditry and Terrorism. Education CS Ezekiel Machogu must come out clear on this psychological torture meted on Form One Students by failures in upper secondary. Which chapter of #MensConference2023 is this?" he tweeted. In the video, two school-going boys are tied together with their ties and the person recording is heard instructing them to slap each other, knock their heads together. They are also shown how they are supposed be slapping each other. Our fact check has found that the video is from a school in Zimbabwe identified as Churchil High School, this is after a video search was done. According to H-Metro, a news outlet in Zimbabwe, one parent of the student bullied demanded that the Churchil High School administration should identify the bullies and punish them. "This is not right for learning institutions," the outlet read. This fact check was published by The Star with support from Code for Africa’s PesaCheck and African Fact-Checking Alliance.
