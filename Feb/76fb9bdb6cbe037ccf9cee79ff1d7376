A proposal by Azimio leader Raila Odinga to revert to a manual voting system has met opposition. Election Observer Group (ELOG) led by National Coordinator Mulle Musau said the manual system should not be an option. In an interview with the Star on  Thursday, Mule recommended a review of technology used in elections with a view to improving on its weaknesses. "We will not wish away technology in the modern world that we are living in. Anybody talking about reverting to the manual system especially in Kenya which has heavily invested in the digital space I think it’s going to be very difficult," Mulle said. Mulle explained that what the country should consider doing is conducting an audit on election technology used to work on weaknesses which will be found. "We must review what works for us and what does not work for us. We can consider whether we can make any improvement on it or do away with it," Mulle explained. Raila while addressing Leadership Conference in Lagos, Nigeria claimed election technology has been compromised and results altered. "As we have witnessed in Kenya both in 2017 and 2022, technology is getting compromised and results altered. This has severely damaged the credibility of election management bodies in many of our countries," Raila said.
