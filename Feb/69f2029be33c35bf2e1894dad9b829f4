A Facebook account claiming to belong to the National Police Spokesperson Resila Atieno Onyango is fake. The Facebook account, whose first post was shared on November 12, 2022, goes by the username “Resila Atieno Onyango”. The account's bio refers to itself as the “Kenya national police spokesperson at Government of Kenya Spokesperson”. The last post was shared on November 18, 2022, and it was a  picture of Onyango with no caption. The Facebook account we are fact-checking is among the Facebook accounts flagged as fake by NPS. In a tweet, NPS said the Facebook account is one of the existing fake accounts that are flagged as fake and maintained by unscrupulous imposters with criminal intent. The police body urged members of the public to be cautious of any information posted on the Facebook account we are debunking and other Facebook accounts that have been impersonating Onyango. “We wish to caution the public against interacting with the multiple accounts purporting to belong to the National Police Service Spokesperson and Director Corporate Communications at the NPS, Dr Resila Onyango, PhD,” the National Police Service wrote. “We urge the public to desist interacting with the imposters, as we liaise with other agencies for appropriate action on the pages and their handlers,” the NPS added. According to the NPS, the Police Spokesperson does not operate any social media account and only transacts her official police duties through the NPS's official communications platforms. Onyango is the new police spokesperson who took over from Bruno Shioso on November 8, 2022.
