Great Rift Valley professional golfer Jastas Madoya has set his goals when he tees off at the Magical Kenya Open set for next month at the par 71 Muthaiga Golf club. Madoya, who made the cut at the 2019 event, said he is ready to ruffle feathers with the rest of 156 players field when action tees off on March 9-12. Madoya is among eight Kenyan professionals and six amateurs targeting a share of the $2 million (Sh249 million) prize money. “I am very ready to battle for top prizes after missing out in the past years. I made the cut last in 2019 and I have been practicing to eliminate some mistakes. If you were keen on the last two Safari Tour legs, you will know that indeed I am ready,” said Madoya. He said that mistakes in golf can only be rectified two months prior to the event and that he perfected his act in the last two Safari Tour events at Karen and Muthaiga. In Karen, Madoya finished third in a playoff against Zimbabwean Visitor Mapwanya and Kenya Railways’ Samuel Njoroge at the three-hole decider after all posted seven under par 281. At Muthaiga, he managed to finish in second position, tied with Muthaiga’s pair of Greg Snow and Mutahi Kibugu at 283 gross in a tournament won by Mapwanya in 282 last week. “I have already made some changes, rectified my simple mistakes and improved on my swing. At the moment, the swing  is perfect and that has offered great results,” he said. At the conclusion of Safari Tour series, Madoya managed 159 points as the sixth best Kenyan behind Snow (236), Karen winner  Samuel Njoroge, Dismas Indiza (184), Simon Ngige (179) and Mutahi Kibugu (169). Others are Daniel Nduva (149) and Mike Kisia on 114. The six local amateurs include Kenya Amateur Match Play Champion from Limuru Dennis Maara, the Stroke Play Champion, who is also the Kenya Amateur Golf Championships (KAGC) champion John Lejirma (Kenya Railways), Nyali’s Adel Balala, Muthaiga’s Jay Sandhu, Njoroge Kibugu (Muthaiga) and Daniel Kiragu (Muthaiga).
