Double Olympic Games 1,500m champion Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon made a successful return to cross country running after winning the Sirikwa Cross Country Tour on Saturday at the Lobo Village in Eldoret. Kipyegon won the 10km senior women's title in 33:50, edging out Commonwealth Games 3,000m steeplechase champion Jackline Jepkoech to second in 34:52 and World Under 20 3,00m silverÂ  medailsit Zena Jeptoo (35:08). "I had some fears at first because I had not run 10km in cross country since 2017 in Kampala. Many of my fans were expecting a good performance and I was lucky to win. I can say it is my first major win this year and also my first in 10km." National cross country champion Charles Lokir made it two wins in as much outings as he clinched the men's title. The Iten-based Lokir crossed the finish line in 30:14 ahead off Josphat Kiprotich (30:19) and Dennis Kipngetich (30:21). Fresh from winning the national under-20 title, Samuel Kibathi and Lucy Nduta extended their winning run with wins in the junior men and women's races. Kibathi led Kelvin Kiprop and Gideon Kipngetich to rhe podium in respective times of 24:20, 24:40 and 24:45. "The win gives me confidence as I prepare for the Africa Under 20 championships. I have embarked on a tough training regime after winning the national cross country championships," Kibathi said. Nduta won the 6km race in 21:13, beating Maureen Jepkoech and Deborah Jemutai, who clocked 21:14 and 21:41 respectively. Nduta, who trains in Nyahururu, is also looking forward to the continental championships. "I had prepared very well for this race," she said. "I would have run faster but we ran against strong winds. However, the course is not as tough as last year's," Nduta said.
