Kiambu county MCAs will move to impeach Governor Kimani  Wamatangi if he doesn't start to deliver development projects. This is according to Githiga ward MCA Ruth Waithira. Speaking at an interview on Tuesday, Waithira claimed the MCAs don't have a ward development kitty to aid their projects. Waithira said her work is now to oversight, legislate and represent her people. "We sat down and it's six months now, he has never done anything. We have tried meeting and everything but nothing is happening," she said. Waithira said she will be the first to table an impeachment motion against the governor if the situation remains the same for long. "If you don't work for our people, we impeach you. And I will be the mover of that motion because I cannot afford to let my people down," she said. "Shape up or ship out," Waithira said.
