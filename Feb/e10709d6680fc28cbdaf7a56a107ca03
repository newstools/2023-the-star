Azimio leader Raila Odinga has told President William Ruto to stop targeting former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta over tax obligation. Raila said Ruto should respect Mama Ngina for her contribution during the struggle for independence. “You do not know where Kenya is from. She was arrested and locked up in Kamiti during the struggle for independence. She is in her 80s, why are you insulting her yet she is the age of your grandmother?” Raila posed. Speaking on Sunday during an Azimio rally in Kibra, Nairobi, the Opposition leader said Mama Ngina responded to Kenya Kwanza leaders on Saturday because she could not take the “insults” anymore. “Every day, he talks about taxation, claiming there are people who are not paying what is due to the government,” Raila said. The Azimio leader added that the Kenya Revenue Authority is the body mandated by law to collect taxes and not Ruto or his deputy Rigathi Gachagua. “Let KRA do its work. Do not politicise the work of the agency. Even in the Bible, Zachayo the Tax Collector was not doing the things you’re doing,” he stated. “Leave Mama Ngina alone. Also leave Uhuru Kenyatta alone.” Speaking during the opening of the Tewa Catholic Church which she helped build in Mpeketoni, Lamu County, the former First Lady paying taxes is a must for everybody, big or small. “Paying taxes is a must whether you are big or small. People must pay taxes according to their income,” she said. However, Mama Ngina said tax matters should not be politicised and discussed in rallies by government officials. “This is because if you do not pay, you should be taken to court,” she stated. Mama Ngina said politicians were peddling lies so that they can be seen to be working.
