A video that has circulated on social media of a man claiming that vasectomy can only be performed on dogs is misinformation. In the video, the man says in their culture, the procedure is performed on dogs to prevent them from impregnating their mates around the village. “Hiyo kwetu inafanyiwa maumbwa, na ndio inafanya umbwa isitoke kwa nyumba iende kwa jirani.” This is loosely translated to: The process, according to where I come from, is only performed on dogs so that they don’t go to the neighbor or get out of the house. A Twitter user by the name Protus supported the man's sentiment and asked his followers to run away from vasectomy as they are not dogs. Vasectomy is a surgical procedure to cut or seal the tubes that carry a man’s sperm to permanently prevent pregnancy. During the procedure, the male vas deferens (tube which conveys sperm from the testicle) is cut and tied or sealed to prevent sperm from entering into the urethra. This thereby prevents fertilisation of a female through sexual intercourse. Men undergo the procedure as family planning method.
