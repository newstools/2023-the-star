The ruling on a petition challenging Governor Paul Otuoma’s election is set for Thursday (today). The petition was filed by John Bunyasi, the main challenger in the race to succeed Sospeter Ojaamong. The former Nambale MP in the petition alleges there were multiple irregularities during the poll which, according to him, worked in his disfavour. Otuoma was declared the winner in the gubernatorial race after garnering 164,478 votes against Bunyasi’s 92,144. Those in the race were Daniel Mogoria who got 14,396 votes followed by Ojaamong’s deputy Moses Mulomi who received 2,546 votes and Michael Oloo who had 1,675 votes.
