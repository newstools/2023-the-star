South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the resignation of his deputy, David Mabuza, thanking him for his "unwavering support" over the last five years. Local reports say it comes as no surprise because Mr Mabuza had already announced earlier this month that he would be stepping down. He will stay in the post until Mr Ramaphosa announces his successor, widely expected to be new ANC Deputy President Paul Mashatile. A cabinet reshuffle is expected next week once South Africa's annual budget is announced. The government is under pressure to prove it has the answers to the countries economic woes and rolling blackouts.
