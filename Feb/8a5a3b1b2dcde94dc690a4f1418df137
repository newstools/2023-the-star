Residents at the Dina area in Webuye town on Tuesday woke up to a lifeless body of a middle-aged security guard lying in a pool of blood. Speaking to the press in Webuye town, residents led by Mathews Wangila, condemned the incident calling on the police officers to launch investigations. “It’s so unfortunate that the police station is some metres from here yet criminals can come and attack our people,” Wangila said. “The man lying behind us served us decently, we have never had a problem with him, he just took over yesterday after the exit of his colleague." Eliud Barasa, a human rights activist urged security officers to be more vigilant to curb rising insecurity cases in Webuye town. “I want the police to investigate suspicious characters in Webuye town, they could be the ones behind these sporadic attacks,” Barasa said. Barasa also called on landlords to conduct background checks on the tenants they are leasing houses to. The body of the deceased was moved to the Webuye County Hospital mortuary as they launch a probe into the incident.
