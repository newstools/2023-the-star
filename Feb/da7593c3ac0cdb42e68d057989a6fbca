Strategic communications advisor Barrack Muluka has said President William Ruto should not apologise for his appointments. Muluka said Ruto has taken long to remove agents of the previous regime and put people who believe in his bottom-up economic model approach. "That agents of the previous regime should have been removed a long time ago," he said. "President Ruto has taken too long before removing the agents of the ancient regime and put his own people and he doesn't have to be apologetic about it provide that he is doing it within the coordinates of what the constitution says." Muluka spoke on Friday during an interview with the media. He said there is no issue with Ruto's appointments as long as he does not favour people from a certain region and leave others behind. He said Ruto has competent people in his corner including his loyalists which he can appoint to various positions. Since Ruto took to power last year, he has been reorganising the government by appointing people he believes will help implement his agenda for the country. Among the area, Ruto made changes in was with the Kenya Pipeline managing director, Macharia Irungu, who was replaced by Joe Sang. Another change Ruto made at KPC was the revocation of Rita Achieng Okuthe as board chairperson. Okuthe was replaced by Faith Boinett. At KRA, Francis Muthaura was kicked out and replaced by Anthony Mwaura, who until his appointment was United Democratic Alliance’s elections boss.
