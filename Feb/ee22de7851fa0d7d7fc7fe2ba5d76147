Criminal lawyer Cliff Ombeta has said he will appeal the conviction and sentencing of his clients in the Willie Kimani case. Ombeta represented Fredrick ole Leliman (First accused person) and Stephen Cheburet Morogo (Second accused person) in the case regarding the extra-judicial killing of human rights lawyer Wille Kimani together with his client Josephat Mwenda and their taxi driver, Joseph Muiruri. Speaking to the press at the Milimani courts on Friday, Ombeta expressed huge dissatisfaction with the outcome and sentencing of his clients. “We as the defense, it is a judgment that has been disappointing. It is a judgment that was based on evidence that was non-existent,” he said speaking specifically for his clients. Ombeta said he believed that the court had imported evidence so that it could be able to carry out a conviction. “We believe that the court must have wanted to find somebody guilty and therefore the reason why the evidence was imported,” he said. The lawyer further questioned the intentions of the court in regard to the matter that had been brought before it. “Was this court under pressure? Were the NGOs, the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), and other groups put under some kind of pressure? Did the court really want to just convict these people and wash its hands off?” Ombeta asked. Ombeta was speaking after three police officers and an informant were found guilty of the murders of Lawyer Willie Kimani. Fredrick Leliman who was the key mastermind in the Willie Kimani murder case has been sentenced to death in each count. In her ruling, Lady Justice Jessie Lessit said being a police officer paid to safeguard life, he acted contrary to the law. "The murder was meant to interfere with the course of justice. They went through fear torture and excruciating pain as they waited for their turn to be killed," she said.
