More than 800,000 Form 1 students will be admitted to secondary school this week as 30,000 newly hired teachers also report. The Teachers Service Commission said 10,000 of the teachers will be employed on permanent, pensionable terms while 25,550 will be interns. The commission said 9,000 of the slots are for permanent secondary school teachers and 1,000 for primary school teachers, while 21,550 slots are for intern teachers for junior secondary schools. As the Form 1 students report, the ministry has already distributed their textbooks. On Friday, Early Learning and Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang confirmed schools have already received the books. “As you report, you’ll find books in school. We shall ensure that in the shortest time possible, your school fees will be released,” Kipsang said. The new term for Form 1s begins amidst tight rules to prevent school heads from ‘extorting’ parents. The ministry has put in place several measures to ensure learners' admission is smooth. This includes the directive on uniforms and extra levies; all uniforms must cost the same. Extra levies are banned without approval. Kipsang warned teachers from charging parents any unapproved levies. “We will work with TSC to ensure that action is taken against any teacher charging exorbitant fees,” he said. This year's school calendar has resumed normalcy after a two-year break. According to a circular by PS Kipsang, students will break for half-term from March 16 to March 19. Students writing KCSE will sit the exams from November 3 to November 24. This takes 21 days. The the initial calendar showed the KCSE exam would take place from November 10 to December 1. "KCSE marking will run from November 27 to December 15," the circular reads. The first term will have 13 weeks, the second term 14 weeks and third term will be the shortest with 10 weeks.
