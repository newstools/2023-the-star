Eighty three people have died due to the cholera outbreak since the first case was reported in the country in October last year. Health CS Susan Wafula said as of Saturday, 15 counties have reported the outbreak with 4,566 patients having been recorded. This is an increase from 4,173 cases and 72 deaths in January. The CS said even though the counties have successfully controlled the outbreak, there is a need for them to maintain high vigilance. She said despite various efforts by the stakeholders, there is still the challenge of inadequate resources both at national and county levels to facilitate an effective response to the outbreak. “In this regard, we emphasize the need for counties and partners to allocate resources including finances to fast-track containment of the current and future outbreaks,” Wafula said. The CS spoke during the official launch of the first-ever cholera vaccine in Tana River. According to the CS, an assessment conducted by my ministry in collaboration with the affected counties identified several risk factors (drivers) driving the spread of this deadly disease. They include outsourcing of food from food vendors with questionable hygiene standards and congestion in the refugee camps leading to overstretching of sanitary facilities. Others include poor sanitation in informal urban settlements, the sprouting of unregulated water vendors and water from contaminated sources. “Prolonged drought has led to the scarcity of safe drinking water in Asals forcing communities to fetch water from contaminated shallow wells,” she said. “For us to fast-track containment of the outbreak, we must all rise up and collectively address these drivers. This calls for a stronger multi-sectoral, multiagency involvement.”
