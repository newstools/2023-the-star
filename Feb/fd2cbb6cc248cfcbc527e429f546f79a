Marion Jepng’etich and Diana Cherotich, who missed a chance to represent Kenya at World Cross Country Championships in Bathurst, Australia due to visa hitches have been named in Team Kenya for the East Africa Under 18 and Under 20 championships. The duo is part of a 32-strong Kenyan contingent for the regional junior and youth championships to be held at Benjamin Mkapa International Stadium in Dar Es Salaam on March 10-11. The duo trained with Team Kenya for World Cross Country in Kigari but was withdrawn at the last minute due to visa hitches. They have, however, put behind their disappointment and are now focused on the Dar championships. They were picked during the two-day 2nd Athletics Kenya weekend meeting at Nyayo Stadium. During the trials at Nyayo Jepng’etich won the 5, 000m race in 15:51.29 with Cherotich finishing second in 15:51.33. They are set to renew their rivalry in Dar in two weeks’ time in the U20 category. Nancy Cherop, who clinched bronze in the 3, 000m during the World U20 championships in Cali, Colombia is also in the Dar-bound team alongside 400m runner Evaline Chepkoech. Upcoming sprinter and national primary schools 100m record holder Selfa Ajiambo will make her international bow during the two-day event. The sprint sensation, who landed a fully paid scholarship from the Kenya Academy of Sports (KAS,) twice lowered her record during AK meetings in Mumias and Kisumu. Athletics Kenya Youth Development Committee chairman Barnaba Korir said: “We focused mainly on sprints, a few field events and middle-distance runners. The purpose is to give more opportunities to young sprinters at the regional championship.” “Sprinting is fast evolving in the country. There is a lot of interest from the public and we must take advantage of this window.” Under 20 women: Marion Jepng’etich and Diana Cherotich (5, 000), Judy Kemunto (400m), Evaline Chepkoech (400m), Irene Chepkemboi (javeline), mercy Chepkemoi (1,500), Diana Khisa (200m) and Penina mutisya (200m).
