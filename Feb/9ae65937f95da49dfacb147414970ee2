Kenya will host the East and Central Africa Handball Club Championship in December, it has been confirmed. Regional body secretary general, Charles Omondi confirmed the event will take place from December 2-9. Kenya last hosted the event in 2017 with the DR Congo men's side Police and Nairobi Water Queens women emerging Champions. The last two editions of championships were hosted by Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania, and Zanzibar. Kenya were represented by three clubs in Zanzibar last December with National Cereals and Produce Board men and Water Queens returning home as champions. The other team, NCPB women's side were placed second after going down 25-21 to Water Queens, who went on to bag their ninth title in a row. Omondi also disclosed that the visit to the country by Police (men0 and a women's team from DR Congo still hangs in the balance. The top Congolese sides were expected in Nairobi last month for a series of friendly matches against selected sides. "The visit by the Congolese is still on the cards. There are some issues they are sorting out and once they are through, they will inform us," Omondi said. The All Africa Games elimination rounds will be held in July although the venue is yet to be determined. Meanwhile,  the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league matches that took a break last November will resume this weekend.  There are a total of 12 matches, all involving women's teams, on the cards.
