Shabana will seek to bounce back to winning ways after recording two  consecutive losses in the Football Kenya Federation National Super League when they face stuttering Migori Youth on Saturday. Shabana suffered identical 1-0 losses to Kibera Black Stars and in the Kisii derby against Gusii FC. Coach Sammy Okoth said they need to get their act together if they are to battle for promotion to the Kenyan Premier League. “The boys need to forget the two losses and focus on the next game. We need to go back to our winning trends for us to remain in the promotion mix,” said the coach. Shabana lead the second-tier league log with 25 points from 11 games while Kibera Black Stars remain second, two points behind the Glamour Boys. Speaking on Thursday, Migori Youth technical director Wilson Aol predicted a tough but lively match. “We have lost three back-to-back matches while Shabana have lost two. Both teams want to pick up momentum from the game but for us, we are ready to face our neighbours. Expect a highly entertaining game,” said Aol. The highlight of this weekend’s matches will be the highly-anticipated Kibra derby between Kibera Black Stars and Darajani Gogo at Camp Toyoyo. On Sunday, fifth-placed Murang’a Seal will be at home to Coastal Heroes while Mombasa Elite welcome Vihiga United. At Shamu grounds in Kwale County, SS Assad will host millers Mara Sugar as struggling Kajiado FC host Naivas FC at Ildamat Stadium in Kajiado. Silibwet will entertain Mwatate United at Bomet Stadium. On Wednesday, the game between visiting Gusii FC and Kajiado was not played after the hosts failed to provide a properly equipped ambulance. Gusii are likely to be awarded a walkover.
