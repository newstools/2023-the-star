Investments, Trade and Industry Cabinet Secretary (CS) Moses Kuria now blames Fred Matiang’i for the controversy surrounding the China Square supermarket at Unicity Mall along Thika Road. Kuria claims the former Interior CS is the one who issued permits to Chinese traders at the mall. “Dear Fred Okengo Matiangi. Why did you issue work permits to the Chinese traders at China Square at Unicity?” he posed on Twitter. According to most Kenyans on social media, China Square is currently the cheapest supermarket in the city. The supermarket has attracted the masses because of the low prices of its goods and products. The establishment has stocked a wide range of products and services including stationery, furniture, home-decoration items, cleaning supplies, hardware store and electrical appliances. Nairobi residents have been talking about how incredible China Square is in the last few weeks. Before roping in Matiang’i, Kuria had indicated that he want China Square out of the Kenyan market. He urged Kenyatta University Vice Chancellor Paul Wainaina to buy out the lease for the establishment. Unicity Mall was built by Kenyatta University. “I have today given an offer to Wainaina the VC Kenyatta University to buy out the lease for China Square, Unicity Mall and hand it over to the Gikomba, Nyamakima, Muthurwa l and Eastleigh Traders Association,” Kuria said on Friday. “We welcome Chinese investors to Kenya but as manufacturers, not traders.” Small-scale traders from Kamukunji, Eastleigh, Luthuli Avenue and Gikomba are said to be planning to hold a 'peaceful' demonstration in the city centre to protest against China Square's looming business dominance.
