Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome has issued a warning to police officers who violate the law. Koome said that the service will not condone conduct from officers which goes contrary to their duty to the people. "It should be clear that NPS shall not condone or protect any officer found engaging in abuse of his or her powers or privileges, or any other action that can bring disrepute to the image of the police," he said. He issued a statement on Saturday, following a viral video of a police officer seen harassing a member of the public. The IG condemned the actions of the police officer and said the action does not reflect the core values of the National Police service (NPS). "The attention of NPS is hereby drawn to an online video depicting a Police Officer harassing and threatening a member of the public while armed and appearing intoxicated," he said. Koome said that as a service, they are gravely concerned by and strongly condemn the misconduct displayed by the officer. He said that most officers are patriotic to their country and remain steadfast and committed to serving and protecting Kenyans. Koome added that they are focused on and committed to fostering and promoting good police-community relations as enshrined in the constitution. "Finally, we wish to inform the public that the officer in question has since been identified and the incident is currently being reviewed for appropriate internal disciplinary action," he assured.
