Bunyore Starlets' coach Daniel Arunga wants his charges to rise to the occasion during their Kenya Women's Premier League match against  Kayole Starlets. The Luanda-based team is set to face Kayole Starlets on Sunday at Momboha grounds. "That match is very key to us at the moment and we have no choice but to win it," said Arunga. Bunyore are currently in position four with 12 points behind Nakuru Queens, who are third with 13 points. Vihiga Queens (16) and Gaspo (15 points) occupy the top two places. He said Bunyore are fully psyched up for this weekend's match. On the same note, assistant coach Absalom Mariga said they are focused on the next assignment despite minor injuries. "We are currently working on our midfield and striking force to ensure we get goals as well," Mariga said. " Against Vihiga Queens and Gaspo matches,  we lost so many scoring chances and we are not ready to repeat the same mistake again," he posed. He said despite the financial challenges they are facing, the girls are fully psyched up for the league and they will do their best. Vihiga Queens host Ulinzi Starlets as they seek to revive their glory after going down 4-1 against Thika. After winning against Ulinzi Starlets, Wadadia face Nakuru City Queens as Thika Queens battle Gaspo. Kisumu Starlets, who are currently in position 10, encounter Kangemi Ladies, currently placed eleventh.
