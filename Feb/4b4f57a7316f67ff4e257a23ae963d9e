The National Treasury has released Sh2.7bn to support university students' loans and bursaries. This is according to a statement sent out by Education CS Ezekiel Machogu on Friday. Machogu said the government is keen on helping students coming from vulnerable families. "I wish to announce that the National Treasury and Economic Planning has released Sh2.7bn for 180,000 eligible students," Machogu said. This disbursement of funds now allows Helb beneficiaries to register for their exams. University students have been decrying the delayed release of funds by the exchequer, in the past few months. Kenya University Students Organization has urged President William Ruto to intervene in matters HELB. Kenya University Students Organization chair Anthony Manyara wrote to President Ruto on September 26, sayingÂ needy university students were suffering. "It is our request that an intervention or directive is issued to settle the blame-shifting games between HELB and the treasury," Manyara said. He accused HELB of delaying to disburse funds to students. "Comrades receive their loan disbursements to enable them to meet tuition and accommodation costs alongside other needs," he added. HELB CEO Charles Ringera previously noted that the timelines between which treasury operates and the school calendar differ. For instance, currently, students are in an ongoing semester, while Ringera says treasury starts a financial year in June. By this time, students are either in May or September intake. "We have unsynchronized exchequer releases with the academic calendar," he said. In the financial year 2021-22, HELB was able to fund 347,166 students to the tune of Sh14.8 billion. Of these students, 106,048 were from TVETs at Sh3.9 billion, we still have some 35,137 unfunded students. HELB made the highest collection in 2021 at Sh5.2 billion, and from the Covid-19 penalty waiver, the board recovered Sh550 million.
