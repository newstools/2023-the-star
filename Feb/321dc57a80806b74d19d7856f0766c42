Former Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion has said A students should join teaching courses. Speaking on Tuesday in an interview, Sossion said this would help retain the best generation of teachers. "After Form 4, the top students who are scoring A's should join teaching so that we retain the best generation of good teachers. That is what Korea has done," Sossion said. He said Kenya should emulate the Asian country where a majority of the top students choose teaching and it is why they have the best teachers, and their economy is doing good. "Why can't to shift to Asia and do what Asians do, let us not be slaves to the business interests of the west. Let us have our model, likely, a stem education system would do," he said. Sossion said a curriculum cannot exist without teachers. "Look at this CBC Grade 7, we have 18 subjects and teachers are not there, who is going to teach? Books are not going to teach; capitation is not going to teach," he said. Sossion said the presidential working party on Education reforms ought to be completely honest to the country. "We need a completely different education model from this. So, they must undertake a thorough review, give us an education model because they have an opportunity to review," Sossion said. He termed the review as a chance for the nation to right things in the education sector.
