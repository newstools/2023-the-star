Residents living within and around Trans Nzoia county will access free medical services for five days. This is the outcome of a partnership between the Allan Chesang Foundation in partnership with iHOPE (International Help of People Everywhere), the county government, NHIF and other partners. The medical camp began on Monday and will end Friday, February 24. iHOPE is a non-profit humanitarian organization based in the United States of America. Senator Chesang said the camp will offer various services including screening for cardiovascular conditions, Diabetes and Blood Pressure checkups, and Ultrasound screening for pregnant women. Thirty-three doctors from the global community will offer different services. “We also have Pediatric exams, Gynecological services, General Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Pediatric surgeries, OB/GYN Surgeries, and Eye Screening (Presbyopia),” Chesang said. Other services are Breast and Prostate Cancer Education, Nutrition and Personal Health Education, Cervical Cancer Screening, Family Planning, HIV Testing and Counselling. Chesang said that the medical camp aims at having specialised foreign medical professionals perform complex surgical procedures. “They will share knowledge and build the capacity of the County's medical professionals to enable them to contribute more effectively to the County's universal health coverage,” he said. Registration and screening of patients is taking place at Mt Elgon Hospital. Chesang added that the residents have been grappling with expensive medical healthcare services. The first-term senator welcomed Kenyans who stay even outside the county to seek services from the ongoing medical camp.
