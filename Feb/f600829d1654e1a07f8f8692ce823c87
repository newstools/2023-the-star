Vladimir Putin will be giving his annual State of the Nation address at 09:00 GMT. The speech was originally meant to be given in December, but was postponed. It's the first anniversary of the Russian leader recognising the independence of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in Ukraine, which preceded Russia's full invasion. President Biden visited Kyiv yesterday and afterwards President Zelensky said he could see resolve from the US to end Russian aggression this year. Biden is in Poland for a three day visit where he'll meet the country's president to talk about support for Ukraine and deliver a speech.
