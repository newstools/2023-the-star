At least 232,000 poor households from Nairobi County are set to benefit from free health insurance cover. Nairobi County Government is set to partner with the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) to roll out the medical cover. This will enable the less fortunate residents to access treatment free of charge. While making the announcement on Thursday, Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja said the distribution will be 50 households per polling station. “I have been keenly observing what has been happening in other counties and especially in Murang’a and as Nairobi County, we will soon start registering the 232,000 poor families which will benefit from this cover,” he said. Sakaja said the cover will cater for both inpatient, outpatient, dental, optical and last expenses. A similar programme was started in 2021 by the Nairobi Metropolitan where 20,000 vulnerable families got  Sh6,000 NHIF medical cover annually. Murang’a county is also among the first counties to establish such a programme which was launched in November 2022 covering 20,000 vulnerable households in the county. The cover which is dubbed Kang’ata Care caters to inpatient, outpatient, dental, optical and last expenses. Access to health care for all is an integral part of President William Ruto’s manifesto, who has vowed to speed up the much-needed National Health Insurance Fund reforms so that Kenyans from all cadres can benefit from the fund.
