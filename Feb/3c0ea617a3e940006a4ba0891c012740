Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has waded into the ongoing tax tiff between the government and the Kenyatta family. Throwing shade at First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta, Sonko questioned where her presence was when demolitions happened in Nairobi during the Covid-19 pandemic. "When it comes to matters of tax, Mama Ngina is very vocal and has spoken. Where were you when innocent Kenyans faced demolitions in Nairobi during the covid period? he posed. Going further, Sonko stated that he was among those who were purged for supporting President William Ruto before the elections. Sonko said that the law was selectively applied to him for declaring his stand with the Wanjiku against the oppression that was brought by the former regime. Speaking on Sunday in Nakuru, Sonko said that even if revenge was prohibited in the Bible, it is a good lesson to apply to others. "I'm among those who have suffered and were sacrificed because of taking a stand with Ruto and fighting for the Wanjiku's. I Know revenge is bad but Mr President it is a good lesson for many," he said. Sonko went further and emphasised that everyone found guilty should face the law without any favour. He insisted that the law should not be applied selectively to others just because they served in senior government positions. Speaking on anti-government rallies, Sonko told the Kenya Kwanza leaders not to be disturbed. " Ruto is not someone to be threatened by rallies. Stay firm Mr President and know that we are behind you, he said.
