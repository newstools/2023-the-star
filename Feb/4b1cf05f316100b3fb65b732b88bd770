Passengers using the rolled out electric buses by BasiGo will now be able to pay their fare using the cashless mobile money wallet product, SasaPay. This after the payment platform partnered with Oma services on electric buses to offer the passengers with a more convenient payment method as the parties aim to promote the use of the e- vehicles while simplifying the payment process. SasaPay’s managing director Stephen Kaguchia, said this is a move that is well inclined to the e-mobility drive stemming from the global climate action initiatives. “We are excited to be collaborating with the electric bus company to offer this payment solution for passengers, as by enabling them to pay for their tickets directly from their mobile phones, we are making the process more convenient and streamlined," he said. On their part, Oma services said they are equally enthusiastic about the collaboration with a further aim of having a cashless matatu industry in the country. The chairman, George Githinji notes that he believes the service offered by SasaPay will make it easier and more convenient for passengers to use their buses. "This even as we look forward to working together to make cashless payment more accessible to everyone," Githinji said. The move to go cashless in the matatu industry has been a debate in the country in recent past with the Matatu Owners Association calling for the introduction of a cashless system in Nairobi city transport. The association noted that the move would be beneficial to the transport system by making it seamless. "It would also help boost the industry which has been affected by corruption over the years, and we will strive to push for the cashless system in the industry because once we reduce corruption by 50 per cent, then we will avoid all this rush because there is no ready money," the association's CEO Patricia Mutheu said.
