South African socialite Zari Hassan has talked about raising her kids alone. The mother of five recently shared a video on TikTok, dancing with her daughter Tiffah and talking about the struggles of being a single mum. "Who said women can't raise kids on their own?" she shared. "Yes, women are doing it all lately. Because sometimes, it's the only choice we have #momlife #momprenuer #lovelife." A fan was quick to call her out noting that her baby daddy Diamond Platnumz provides for his two children Tiffah and Prince Nillan. katungi221..."But the father to those two kids support u dear." Zari agreed but suggested that he is not actively raising them with her physically and emotionally. "Financially supporting me doesn't mean raising a child. know the difference."
