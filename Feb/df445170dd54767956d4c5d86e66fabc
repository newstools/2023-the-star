It’s a full race card and a busy day at Ngong Racecourse for the Fillies Guineas Ladies Day on Sunday. The seven races promise competitive running on a firm track under a warm afternoon. The main race, the Fillies Guineas, a 1600m race for three year old fillies only — at 2:45pm — has a strong field, but the undefeated Honeybell Orange is the favourite. The much-spoken about Daisy has a chance if she can run to her potential. The main sprint of the afternoon is the 1,000m Harry Deakin Memorial Bowl, which will be another closely-fought affair with the zany Jack Sparrow as the likely front-runner, who will have to wrestle the never-say-die Pretty Pearl and the rambunctious Bullet. The races around the Fillies Guineas and the festivities have some close tussles, but Dusha should win the 1200m Duke of Manchester Cup unless Salt Lake causes an upset, continuing some strong from. Rahal, who did not run in the Kenya Guineas, should win the 1600m Pinky Mahajan Handicap while Go Pro is the favourite for the 2060m Vicky Jackman Handicap. Scott, Cranleigh and Chipping are all strong contenders in the 1800m Harrison White Handicap whilst the race of the unknowns, the Frankie Icely Maiden, is anyone’s for the taking where the names are as exciting as mysteries of these first-time runners. The breath between races is populated with DJ’s, acrobats, and an aerial aerobatic display at 2:20pm from daredevil pilot Mark Ross, just before the Fillies Guineas race. A delectable consortium of wide-ranging food and drink are also available, showcasing some of Nairobi’s finest pop-up cuisines. The tradition of fashion at the races continues to colour the day with the local and international culture being adorned by some of Kenya’s top models. Ladies day always attracts a chic and vogue crowd from all. Nondescript RFC are also running kids rugby clinics and there are closely-fought junior races across the downhill bouncing castle slide.
