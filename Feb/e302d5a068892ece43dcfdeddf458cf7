Kakamega county governor Fernandez Barasa has ordered a comprehensive audit of all mine shafts within the next week. The County Disaster Multisectoral team and the Artisanal Mining Committee have been asked to ensure all mines in Ikolomani and Shinyalu sub-counties are thoroughly audited. Speaking during a mass funeral of five victims of the recent collapsed mine tragedy at Sigalagala at the Khayega grounds in Shinyalu Sub-County, Barasa said the audit will enable the identification of security gaps in the sector and inform safety reforms. The incident happened a week ago where 12 miners were trapped under one of the shafts in the area. Five people lost their lives in the tragedy. Barasa called on all licensed mine owners and miners to ensure their premises are safe for those working there to eke a living. “We want that audit done in the next seven days so we identify and address any areas of weakness because this should be a lucrative and safe venture for our people who depend on it for a living,” said Barasa. The governor further instructed the Departments of Water, Environment, Natural Resources & Climate Change and Public Service and County Administration to upscale sensitization and capacity building of artisanal miners on health and occupational safety. Barasa who is equally the Chairperson of the Finance and Economic Affairs Committee at the Council of Governors called on MCAs to support the Mining Act presented to the floor of the House by Ikolomani MP Benard Shinali. The Act outlines the allocation of 70, 20 and 10 per cent of proceeds from mining to the National and County Governments and the local Community respectively. Speaking at the same event, Kakamega deputy governor Ayub Savula implored MPs to review the Mining Act to allow for the retention of a percentage of funds acquired from mining activities, including profits, to assist in capacity-building OF  youth involved in the venture.
