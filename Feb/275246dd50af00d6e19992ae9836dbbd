Amref Health Africa has called on the government, policymakers and the private sector to eliminate period poverty and the stigma surrounding menstruation. Period poverty describes the struggle many low-income women and girls face while trying to afford menstrual products. Amref in a statement said access to menstrual products and education on menstrual health is crucial to ensure that girls and women can live with dignity, free from shame and discrimination. “We must work together to ensure that every girl and woman in Kenya can manage their menstrual cycle with dignity and without shame, stigma or inequity,” the statement said. Amref has further condemned the incident in which senator Gloria Orwoba was asked to leave the chamber because of a blood stain on her trousers. According to Amref, the incident serves as a reminder of the need to address period poverty and the stigma surrounding menstruation, which affects millions of girls and women globally. Amref has acknowledged the effort by the government to provide free and quality sanitary towels in government schools but pointed out that significant barriers still exist. “These obstacles hinder girl's and women’s ability to access menstrual products and proper sanitation facilities, making it highly concerning that girls miss school due to lack of access to these basic needs,” the statement reads. Data by the organisation shows that 65 per cent of women and girls in Kenya cannot afford sanitary pads and only 50 per cent of girls openly discuss menstruation at home. Just 12 per cent would feel comfortable receiving information from their mothers. Similarly, two out of three pad users in rural Kenya receive them from sexual partners and one in four girls do not associate menstruation with pregnancy. “This highlights how menstrual hygiene management is tied to gender inequity and other fundamental risks.”
