Diamond Platnumz's ex-brother-in-law Petit Man Wakuache has alleged his ex-wife Esma, Diamond's sister, has denied him access to his daughter. Petit and Esma have a daughter named Taraj. The businessman posted a lengthy message on Instagram about his feelings towards Esma and Taraj. He said Esma has sole custody of their daughter. Petit said denying him his rights as a father is breaking the law. "The other day I tried to send my child's gifts to her school but I was told that there are special instructions from above that I cannot see [her]," he wrote on Instagram. "I have received them and I have put them at home the day she comes to see them the story will continue...) Petite has another child, a boy with his current wife. He said his daughter and son are not able to bond because of her absence.
