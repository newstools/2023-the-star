I remember when life was easy, a time when I looked forward to meeting up with my friends. Then I was a child (I still am). I remember having a sense of freedom, as a child being happy, appreciating the little we had or the much we had. The innocence before knowing trauma exists or even acknowledging it. Innocence described or describes children, authenticity follows suit when you see a child. So young, full of life, happy, with dreams they know they can achieve and live in the moment. As children, we trusted that tomorrow would be okay. We took life as it came, if the food was not enough, we shared, if the neighbours' children were home we played together. Those raised in rural areas, we fetched firewood together, lit the fire together, and enjoyed every single moment and radiated joy. If you had cows, some milked the cows in the morning, others did herding during the day, and for some, we hunted for birds with our catapults. Mornings were welcomed as a family, over breakfast stories were told and after school, we enjoyed tales from our grandparents. Today most detest the sound of their alarm. But what happened, what happened to living in the moment? I walk around and most people are either battling with something and more often than not they cannot control it. Comparison has killed the child within us. Comparison has made us feel life is nothing if I am not making it like so and so, do not get me wrong chase the bag, I support that but chase it as you acknowledge the now. When you love yourself too much, they project. Humans are complicated, or maybe we as humans just complicate ourselves. Maybe life is hard because we are too fixated on the destination; maybe accepting that we cannot change our current situation beyond what we have tried will set us free.
