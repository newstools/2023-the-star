Bungoma-based Rangers' bumper harvest in the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) matches in Nairobi has given them the confidence of a top-four finish, according to coach Reagan Makona. After three wins and a draw for the self-supporting side over the weekend, the tactician said going by the way they have been playing, they have a chance of shocking one of the top three sides. In their next visit to the city, Rangers' target is to dim one of the top three champions and leaders Nairobi Water Queens, Ulinzi Sharks and National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). “We are targeting one of the top three sides. We must bring one down and we are confident of that,” offered a confident Makona. Rangers were close to having a perfect four-our of -four wins on the road before fatigue forced them to play out for a 35-35 draw against Kenyatta University who roared back from an 18-14 halftime deficit to earn a deserved point.  In their three weekend victories at Nyayo Stadium, they nipped Net Navigators 32-28, crushed Nairobi City County (NCC) 41-19 and punished Amazon 41-26. Makona said he is satisfied with the progress, considering he posted good results despite not having his young high school players travel with the team coupled with transportation challenges. Rangers are made up of more than 20 players, many of them students from high school and others who have just left school.  Rangers, who play all their matches away are third on the log with 23 points from 15 matches, having posted 11 wins. They have drawn once and lost thrice. With only six matches left to play, they will have to continue that drive if they are to hang in around leaders Water Queen who have 28 points, and second-placed Ulinzi Sharks who have 24. There are a total of 12 games again this weekend and Rangers who only travel once monthly because of the cost and the distance have no fixtures. However, they will be watching the proceedings keenly from Bungoma county.
