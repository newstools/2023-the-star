Senior counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi has urged the Kenya Kwanza government not to follow the footsteps of Jubilee’s primitive action. Speaking on Thursday, Ahmednasir said the government should use the proper channel in case of arrests. "Don't copy the primitive style of harassing or raiding opponents at night or weekends and don't use the criminal process. Invite Matiang'i in writing then retrace his steps and every asset he owns," he said. There were claims that elite police officers arrived and surrounded former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on Wednesday night at Karen home to arrest him for unspecified reasons. The former CS said he had learnt of the planned raid earlier in the day. He defended himself from any wrongdoing saying he left the government a clean man. However, Inspector General of police Japhet Koome denied claims his officers went to Matiangí’s house. He said he had checked and found no such operation was sanctioned if any. Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission chief executive officer Twalib Mbarak also denied his officers were involved in the said attempted raid. This was in reaction to reports that a group of police officers tried to access the former CS’ home. The officials who arrived in two unmarked cars claimed they were from EACC and Asset Recovery Agency. ARA officials too denied they were at the home.
