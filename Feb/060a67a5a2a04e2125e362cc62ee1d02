Former Tusker Project Fame judge, Ian Mbugua, has revealed that he has never celebrated Valentine’s Day. Speaking exclusively to the Star, Mbugua who is well remembered as a no-nonsense adjudicator in the since-halted singing competition pointed out that he does not believe in Valentine’s Day. “What is Valentine’s? You celebrate love every single day,” he said. The music teacher also made it clear that he had no plans to celebrate this year’s Valentine’s Day in any special way. Mbugua was one of the Panellists in this year’s Men’s Conference held at Carnivore Simba Saloon on Tuesday. He dismissed the notion that the event is meant to hijack Valentine’s Day. He noted that the event is meant to create a platform for him to articulate issues regarding men. “Men’s Conference is just men coming together and discussing matters relating to men. That is all it is. It has nothing to do with Valentine's. Just men coming together to share their experiences and ask questions,” he said. He also encouraged men to seek help whenever they encounter mental health issues. He told them not to shy away from seeking professional help when they are in distress. “It’s up to them (men) to decide. They should ask themselves, do I need help or not? And if I need help, where can I get it from? They are people who are trained to do this. There are counsellors; there are psychologists who are trained for this. That is their job. Look for one and seek help.” Asked if there are life mistakes he did in his youthful days, Mbugua noted that he got no regrets in life, only lessons. Mbugua was among the guests and key speakers at Men’s Conference 2023 held on Tuesday. Other guests included Journalist Stephen Letoo, News anchor Swaleh Mdoe, lawyer Danstan Omari, Comedian Dr. Ofweneke, Dr Frank Njenga, Kileleshwa MCA Robert Alai, Shaffie Weru, Pastor S and Chris Kirwa.
