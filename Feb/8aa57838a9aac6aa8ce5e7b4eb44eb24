A section of the streets in Kisii was a no-go zone on Saturday after Azimio and UDA supporters clashed. At least four youths were injured in the morning melee. A police officer in riot gear also suffered slight injuries on the back after he was pelted with a stone. The skirmishes broke out near Ram Hospital along Daraja Moja-Nyamataro bypass after several youths who had filtered out of Kisii County Assembly engaged the UDA youth with stones. Fred Nunda the UDA group leader condemned the incident. He said they were having peaceful demonstrations when they were provoked by a rival group. "They began throwing stones at us. We did not have any issues with them, we only had misgivings with the way ODM leader Raila Odinga and Siaya Senator James Orengo used their rally in Kisii to trade very disparaging remarks on our leaders," said Nunda. The demonstrations had begun from Daraja Mbili market, with some riding into the Capital Round About. They addressed journalists before heading out to Daraja Moja-Nyamataro bypass where they ran into the stone-pelting mobs. The group which filtered out of the Kisii County Assembly were not ready to talk by the time of this publication.
