Controversy has erupted over the proposal that the Kenyatta and Moi families should not pay estate duty. In the case of the Kenyattas, this seems to have broadened into the question of whether taxes were payable on the merger of NIC and CBA banks. The Kenya Revenue Authority will decide whether taxes were due or payable and the courts will ultimately adjudicate. But, as a principle, there should be a level playing field. All citizens of Kenya should pay tax equally on business and private transactions. The government has inherited a parlous financial regime and is trying to balance its books by cutting Sh300 billion of expenses and raising taxes. Getting rid of tax breaks will help balance the budget but this should be implemented across the board. Companies in Special Economic Zones get tax breaks but are they exporting what they promised? The KRA should investigate. And if former presidents and their families should not enjoy tax breaks, as seems right and proper, that should apply to the present incumbent as well. President Ruto should make it clear that he will not seek any tax exemptions that are not available to ordinary Kenyans. Quote of the day: "What clever man has ever needed to commit a crime?
