The state has launched a Sh914 million management plan to save Ondiri swamp near Kikuyu town. Ondiri swamp is vitally important. It is the source of the Nairobi River and its 40 springs recharge Kikuyu springs, which has provided piped water for Nairobi since 1906. It is the only 'quaking bog' in Africa apart from Cameroon. With its abundant birdlife, it is a potential tourist attraction. Ondiri swamp must be saved and protected. It is good that top people from Nema and the Environment ministry attended the launch of the management plan last Saturday. But why does it cost over Sh900 million to protect this vital wetland? All that is needed is to stop people encroaching on the 85 acres of Ondiri swamp and extracting water. Nature will do the rest and restore the swamp to good health. The fundamental problem is that the authorities, including Nema and Kiambu county, have been reluctant to crack down on farmers around Ondiri extracting water. So just protect Ondiri swamp. Stop farmers extracting water and farming at the margins. Ondiri will soon return to its former natural glory and government will save Sh900 million.
