Three Ugandans were affected by the devastating earthquake in Turkey, the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said. In a statement dated February 10, the ministry said the three nationals who reside in Diyarbakir were affected with one of them currently undergoing treatment in a hospital in Malatic City as a result of the injuries sustained and was responding well to treatment. The ministry however allayed fears that her nationals might have died as a result of the earthquake and dismissed reports associating the death of a resident named Fred Lumbuye with the earthquake. “The majority of Ugandans in Turkey reside in Ankara, Istanbul, Konya, Izmir and Antalya which were not affected by the earthquake,” the statement reads. “The ministry would like to clarify that the two girls captured in a video circulating on different media platforms expressing distress had earlier been contacted by officials of the Ugandan Embassy in Ankara- and remain in constant communication to offer the required support.” The ministry has called on all Ugandan nationals in Turkey to reach out to the Uganda Embassy in Ankara for any support. It further said the ministry together with the embassy will continue to monitor and follow up on the nationals residing in Turkey, while at the same time proving regular updates on the situation. At least 15,000 people are confirmed dead in Turkey and northern Syria with thousands of survivors spending nights in freezing conditions. On Thursday, Kenya’s Foreign Affairs CS Alfred Mutua called on Kenyans of goodwill to offer material support to the people of Turkey and Syria affected by the earthquake. While addressing the media, Mutua said the support includes clothing, foodstuff, financial and medical supplies to alleviate human suffering.
