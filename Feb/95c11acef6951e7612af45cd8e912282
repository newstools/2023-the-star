The Anti-FGM Board of Kenya has taken to sensitising elders from the Sabaot community on ending Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The board met with the elders as part of their strategy to engage cultural elders and men, especially in FGM-practicing communities. "We met Sabaot elders at Kapsokwony, Mt Elgon Sub County for a dialogue on eradicating FGM among the Sabaot community because they are gatekeepers cum custodians of culture," they said. The board had previously called on the Sabaot elders to emulate their Samburu counterparts in the fight against the FGM menace. "There were 21 cases of FGM reported in the Mount Elgon region during the holiday season," they said. The board applauded efforts by Samburu elders for their declaration to end FGM in their community. They sensitised the Sabaot elders on how culture and traditions influence human life and behaviour, the effects of FGM, the origin of FGM, the global, regional and national situation of FGM, and the role of elders in the eradication of FGM. Anti-FGM Board Programs Manager Nyerere Kutwa said the vital role of elders in the campaign to end FGM is their role as gatekeepers of culture, and their voice to sway the community.
