Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has dismissed as delusional any notion that his relationship with President William Ruto will disintegrate. The DP said any insinuations of an impending rift between him and the head of state are nothing more than a creation of the media. "They are praying every day that I and William Ruto can disagree. Mtangonjea, mangoes mtachoka (you will grow tired waiting)," Gachagua said. He spoke on Thursday during a burial ceremony of his sister-in-law Nancy Muthoni in Gatanga, Murang'a county. Gachagua said Ruto's leadership in government is steadfast and will continue holding strong regardless of their detractors' wishes. "Our government is one under President William Ruto with his ideas. Tunashikana kama Chanda na pete (we are paired like a finger and the ring)," he said The DP further dismissed the existence of any sought of division amongst leaders in Mt Kenya saying the region is united by the common cause of achieving economic freedom. "This mountain of ours is united in purpose and our issues are straightforward forward and they are the issues that bring us together. The issues of coffee, tea and milk," he said. The DP further lashed out at the media saying they portrayed them negatively during the campaign period but gladly, their opinion did not count since voters still elected them. "You can write headlines but you will never stop us from speaking the truth. We now have a chance to work for Kenyans, they will judge us on the basis of our output," he said. "If our fate was to be decided by the press, Ruto would be in Sugoi and I would be in Wamunyoro but your opinion does not count in this country, that is why we ignore you." The DP reiterated that the Kenya Kwanza regime is working for the entire country regardless of how they voted in the August 9 polls. "The other day we were in Siaya, and those people did not vote for us. We were in Homa Bay, they did not vote for us, we are working for the whole country," he said.
