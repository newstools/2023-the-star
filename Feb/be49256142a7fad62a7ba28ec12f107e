Azimio leader Raila Odinga has said President William Ruto's government is trying to weaken the Opposition. Speaking during an interview with KTN on Tuesday, Raila regretted that Ruto had "invaded" the Jubilee party. "We have said that if someone wants to leave, it should not be a secret, they should talk to us and then leave. But they (government) are trying to weaken the Opposition," he said. Asked how he was going to ensure that the Opposition stayed strong, Raila recalled flashed back during the struggle for multiparty system saying that leaders who defected to KANU were expected to follow the political parties' guidelines by resigning from their elective seats. "Even when I decamped from Ford Kenya, I resigned my position as Lang'ata MP. I had to contest again through NDP," he said. Referring to the pro-William Ruto Jubilee leaders, Raila said it was unfair that they had not alerted their supporters or resigned before defecting. He said in decamping, they were not representing their supporters. "It's not fair and I want to tell President William Ruto that this is not fair," he said. The ODM boss said this was among the reasons that the Azimio outfit had resolved to hold barazas to consult the public on the same. "We went back to the citizens to find out if they agree with what is happening in the National Assembly. We want to know if their needs are being presented on the floors," he said. Raila reiterated that the ultimate power belonged to the citizens.
