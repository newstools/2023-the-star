Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) has been named the African Cargo Airport of the Year at the STAT Trade Times International Awards for Excellence in Air Cargo. The awards held on Wednesday in Johannesburg South Africa recognised JKIA's "exceptional performance" in cargo infrastructure, systems, and services, as well as its commitment to excellence in air transport services. Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has in recent years invested heavily in infrastructure and systems at JKIA through Public Private Partnerships (PPP), positioning it as a preferred airport for handling perishables, pharmaceuticals, horticulture, and live animals. The investment saw the volume of cargo traffic handled at JKIA rise from 308, 000 tonnes in 2020 to 361,500 tonnes in 2021. KAA Managing Director Alex Gitari says the award reflects JKIA's outstanding performance in these areas, competing against some of the most established and busiest cargo airports on the continent. “This achievement is a reflection of our commitment to providing world-class cargo infrastructure, systems, and services, and we are honored to be recognized as a top-performing cargo airport in Africa," said Gitari. This win cements JKIA's position as a leading cargo airport in the region, and enhances its reputation for excellence in cargo handling and air transport services. According to the 2022 Economic report, the volume of all cargo handled at all the Kenyan airports between 2017 and 2021 went up by 16.9 per cent from 321,600 thousand tonnes in 2020 to 375,800 tonnes in 2021. "We are extremely proud to receive this prestigious award, which is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team at JKIA,” added Gitari. The STAT Trade Times International Awards for Excellence in Air Cargo is one of the most prestigious awards in the air cargo industry, recognising excellence in air cargo services, logistics, and transportation worldwide.
