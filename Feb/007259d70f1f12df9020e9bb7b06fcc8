Kenya Lionesses'  fly-half Grace Adhiambo has signed a six-month deal with Nagato Blue Angles in Japan. The playmaker, who in November was voted the Sports Personality of the Month for steering the Lionesses to victory in the Africa Cup tournament in Uganda, is expected to play a key role at the Japanese club starting with the Sevens campaign this weekend. The playmaker said she is delighted for the opportunity to play in the Far East. "I’ve always wanted to build my career as a professional athlete and I’m very grateful for the opportunity. I’m looking forward to deepening my skills and career as a rugby player.” She added: “I am just happy for this opportunity because it’s something I've always been longing for—playing professional rugby. This is a chance for me to get more skills in my career." Adhiambo joins Janet 'Shebesh' Okello as the second Kenya Lionesses player to play in Japan. She will also link up with South African star Nadine Roos at the club. Kenya Lionesses' head coach Dennis Mwanja welcomed the deal and hopes other Kenyan players can get such opportunities to showcase their talents “It's good for Adhiambo and for the country because of the pedigree of the league in Japan. She will learn a lot and we hope we can send more of our players to these professional environments," he added. The Blue Angels compete in the Taiyo Seimei Women’s Seven Series, where 12 clubs play in four tournaments over four months to determine a national champion.
