Makueni Governor Mutula Kilonzo Jnr has weighed in on Friday's sentencing of former police officer Fredrick Leliman to death. Leliman, the mastermind in the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani, his client Josphat Mwenda and taximan Joseph Muiruri was handed the death sentence. Leliman was handed the death penalty despite the Supreme Court in 2017 having declared capital punishment unconstitutional. Stephen Cheburet, the second accused person, was sentenced to 30 years,Â  Sylvia Wanjiku 24 years while police informer Peter Ngugi got 20 years. While saying that Leliman deserved a longer prison term, Mutula Jnr recalled how lawyers protested demanding for justice after learning of Kimani's death. "When our colleague Willie Kimani was brutally murdered for representing a client, we went to the street," he said. "We pleaded with Cliff O to stand with the legal fraternity. This officer deserves a longer prison term. Rest in peace Willie Kimani," the lawyer-cum-politician added. Mutula Jnr's remarks come after criminal lawyer Cliff Ombeta , who represented Leliman (First accused person) and Stephen Cheburet Morogo in the case, said he will appeal the sentence. "We as the defense, it is a judgment that has been disappointing. It is a judgment that was based on evidence that was non-existent," he said while addressing the media at Milimani law courts on Friday. Ombeta further said he believed that the court had imported evidence so that it could be able to carry out a conviction. Kimani was abducted in June 2016 as he left the Mavoko law courts alongside Mwenda and Muiruri. Their bodies were later found dumped in the Oldonyo Sabuk River wrapped in black gunny bags. According to police, after their abduction, they were held for a few hours at the Syokimau police post before they were taken to a field where they were killed.
