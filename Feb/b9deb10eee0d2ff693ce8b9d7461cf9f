President William Ruto's allies have weighed in on the meeting he held at the State House on Tuesday with a section of ODM MPs. Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa commended the move, pointing out that it was time to deliver and not to do politics. "Alluta continue...... Kenya must move on. Politics are over and we are now working on Delivering services to our people," he said. The Tuesday morning meeting was confirmed by the State House press secretary Emmanuel Talam. He told the Star that the meeting was attended by nine MPs, including Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Caroli Omondi (Suba South) and Shakeel Shabir (Kisumu East, Independent). Others were Felix Odiwuor alias Jalang’o (Lang’ata), Paul Abuor (Rongo), John Owino (Awendo) and Kisumu Senator Tom Ojienda. Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei said the opposition could not stop the Kenya Kwanza administration from transforming Kenya. "ODM MPs today have met President William Ruto at the state house to discuss politics empowerment and development while Tinga is busy with political rallies/Maandamos and defending Mama Ngina, Uhuru and Tax evaders," he said. He added: "Transformation of Kenya is unstoppable under Kenya Kwanza administration." Former nominated senator Millicent Omanga appeared to doubt the intentions of the visit. "Karata ya Baba this time haieleweki! Hii inataka upekuzi wa Nyali MP Mohammed Ali. Yote tisa, kumi, bora maendeleo kwa Wakenya wote Congratulations Mr. President William Ruto," she said. The State House meeting comes shortly after the opposition-held three anti-Ruto rallies at Kamukunji, Jacaranda grounds and Kibra. Speaking after the meeting, Ruto emphasised the need for elected leaders to work together despite their political affiliations. He called on them to lead by example and serve the interest of the people. "Leaders must join hands, foster coexistence and work together in confronting the challenges facing our country," he said.
