KCB have set set their sights on champions Kabras following a huge 62-15 win over Menengai Oilers on Saturday. The bankers showed no mercy to the Oilers in Nakuru, earning revenge for last season's semifinal loss to keep their unbeaten record intact. Assistant coach Dennis Mwanja said he was particularly impressed to see his team hit pick as the season reaches the business end. "Training will be intense this week. Its a big game (against Kabras). We know they are the defending champions but we want to reclaim our spot as the top team in the country,” said Mwanja. Despite the huge win over Oilers in Nakuru, Mwanja said there is room for improvement in set-piece and defence ahead of the top of the table clash. “I believe our scrum and lineout can get better. We had defensive lapses against Oilers but, all in all, the team is headed in the right direction,” added Mwanja. At stake during the encounter will be the home advantage for both the playoffs and the final, something Mwanja believes is key in reclaiming the title. “We want to win the game on Saturday and top the pool to allow us host the final in March. The boys are hungry and determined to go all the way and reclaim the trophy," added Mwanja. Last season, KCB won the league encounter 28-20 but lost the Enterprise Cup final to the sugarmillers 9-6 but Mwanja believes history will count for nothing. "This year is different. It will be different scenario for both teams, whose matches are usually close calls," he said. Over the weekend, Festus Shiasi led the onslaught for the bankers with a hattrick of tries. Darwin Mukidza, Samuel Asati, Elphas Adunga, Brian Wahinya, Griffin Musila, Andrew Amonde and Peter Waitere scored a try each. Mukidza slotted home three conversions and a penalty with Isaac Njoroge adding a penalty. Kabras stay second on the log with 47 points after a 47-6 win over Strathmore as Oilers stay third on 31 points, three ahead of Quins at fourth.
