The star duo of Madelene Stavnar of Norway and Tereza Melecka of the Czech Republic successfully navigated their team of Joe Carvalho, Omar Lewa, and Evelyn Akinyito to victory at the 2023 Magical Kenya Ladies Open Pro-Am at the par-72 PGA Baobab Course, Vipingo Ridge on Wednesday. Madelene Stavnar and Tereza Melecka win the 2023 Magical Kenya Ladies Open Pro-Ame. The 2023 Pro-Am saw every group of amateurs paired with two professionals, who played nine holes each in an effort to give more pros an opportunity to get in their final practice rounds. Defending Magical Kenya Ladies Open champion Esther Henseleit and Ana Pelaez Trivino’s team comprising former Kenya Sevens rugby star Lavin Asego, Stephen Kiptinness, and Mohammed Nyaoga finished third after carding a similar —26 score but losing out on count back. Lavin Asego went on to pick the longest drive accolade in the men’s category, with Sandrah Githere bagging the women’s. A metre’s distance to the pin won Genie Owiti the closest to the pin award in the women’s category while Rory Elliot won the men’s category with a 1.70 metres distance.
