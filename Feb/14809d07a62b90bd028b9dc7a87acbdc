Kenya Basketball Referees Association first vice chairman David Maina has called on Kenya Basketball Federation to pay referees their dues. Maina, concerned with the lack of match officials in recent Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) games, said this can’t be allowed to continue. “We can’t have this going on. This is a national league and referees must be paid so that they are mentally prepared for games. We need good officiating from qualified referees,” he noted. “Threats are not a solution. If the refs are paid, they will come and do their job. Let’s dialogue to sort this problem once and for all,” said Maina, who is also the Equity Bank Dumas coach. Lack of referees continued to dog the league with KBF competition secretary Joseph Amok admitting that all referees on schedule failed to show up at United States International University courts on Sunday. “Non turned up but the matches went on. I had to call in a few (refs) from their homes to come and take charge of the games. We owe them and we are working out ways to pay,” said Amoko. Meanwhile, Amoko said there are teams who owe the federation huge sums of money in participation fees, to the tune of Sh1.2m. In the matches played over the weekend, Dumas regained the top position from Ulinzi Warriors with a 59-46 win over Thunder as Faheem Juma nailed 14 points and Victor Bosire tucked in 11. The bankers have 32 points, same as the soldiers, 64-56 winners over Thunder in a match played on Saturday at the Ulinzi Sports Complex, Langata. They have played 17 and 18 matches respectively.
