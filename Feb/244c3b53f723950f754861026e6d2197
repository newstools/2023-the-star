17-year-old Larmeck Otieno Okech who was set to join Maranda High School but struggled due to a lack of school fees has received a full scholarship. Larmeck was unable to join the National School as his single mother could not raise the fees, yet he had scored 390 marks in KCPE. Larmeck will be able to advance his secondary education. Ryanne Achieng, a Facebook user thanked the well-wisher- the principal of Mbita Boys High School who offered Larmeck a full four-year scholarship. "A big thank you to the Star newspaper for sharing Otieno's story and making people know about his case!" Achieng said. Achieng' who believes that education is a great equaliser, appreciated the efforts by the school principal to help Larmeck advance his education. "My last thank you goes to the Principal Mbita High School for coming to this boy's aid and offering him a full four years scholarship!" Achieng added. Larmeck had been forced to repeat Standard 8, last year after he scored 330 marks due to the same fee problem. Though his school fee is now sorted, Achieng said Larmeck still needs help to buy school uniform. He called on well-wishers to reach out to Larmeck's mother if they wish to offer any help. "Now all that's left is for him to buy a full school uniform that goes for Sh15,000 which we know his mother can't afford so ukiguswa, tumia Ayoki kakitu on 0723881711 uniform inunuliwe so that Jakarachuonyo aende asome one day awe daktari atutibu!" Achieng said. Loosely translated as: "If you feel touched, send someÂ  money to Ayoki, so that the boy can get his uniform and study to one day become a doctor."
