Kenyans have come to the defence of embattled China Square retail outlet saying it has been helping them cope with high cost of living. The mega shop located at Unicity Mall along Thika Road sells items at relatively affordable prices. While traders have bashed the establishment for 'taking away' their customers, consumers feel the new outlet is a blessing as they can now purchase goods cheaply. Veronica Ntaiya who was purchasing beauty products in EastleighÂ  said China Square is only bad for traders. "They are the ones suffering. We are happy to get cheaper goods at this instance when then economy has become unbearable. In fact, they are lowering the cost of living for us," she said during an interview with the Star. Ntaiya travelled all the way from Narok to purchase goods for her cosmetics shop. She said it is only the consumers from Nairobi that had rushed to China Square for the cheaper prices. "Those of us who come from other towns are mostly familiar with Kamukunji, Gikomba and Eastleigh," she said. Mercy Achieng' who was buying household items at Kamukunji market said she has not been to China Square yet but has heard of it. "But once it is reopened, I will go see what the fuss is all about," she said. Achieng' believes it is better for the Chinese to have a manufacturing industry rather than compete with wholesale traders in the country. "Even if consumers are benefiting from the cheaper goods, our brothers and sisters who are traders are suffering. And we should not ignore it," Achieng' said. Brian Otieno who used to buy shoes at Kamukunji market for resell said consumers fail to understand that because traders import goods, they incur costs and increase prices to get profit. " These people think we have been conning them out of their money all this while because of these new cheap prices at China Square," Otieno said. Otieno said consumers ought not be selfish but should help traders fight the new outlet that is slowly taking them out of business.
