Police on Wednesday blocked major roads leading to State House Nairobi over the Azimio prayer rally held at Jevanjee Gardens. There was heavy traffic on adjacent roads as motorists had to use the only available routes. Police said they blocked the roads for security reasons. This is after Azimio leader Raila Odinga led a prayer rally at the Jevanjee Gardens during which he also engaged his supporters. The rally, fashioned as a "call for prayers", sought to pray for the country and efforts aimed at defeating ‘electoral theft’, and the high cost of living. During the prayer meeting, Raila demanded that the Kenya Kwanza government lowers the cost of basic commodities or face mass action within 14 days. "We’ve talked about the rising cost of basic commodities like unga, electricity, fuel, sugar and milk among others for far too long. We have complained about rising taxes and talked about children dropping out of school for lack of fees," Raila said. He also demanded that IEBC servers be opened, "failure to which, we shall lead the people to restore their authority and voice". This is the first time the former Prime Minister is leading other opposition luminaries and a legion of supporters for a prayer rally in the city CBD. He was accompanied by Narc leader Martha Karua, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, former defence CS Eugene Wamalwa, former Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Roots party leader George Wajackoya among other leaders.
