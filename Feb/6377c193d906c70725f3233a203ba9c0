Kenya's fast-rising junior Ishmael Kipkurui shook off a stiff challenge to win a gold medal in the boys' Under-20 in the World Cross Country Championships in Bathurst, Australia. After winning in a time of 24:29, the 18-year-old Kipkurui immediately declared that he wants to emulate the world marathon record holder, Eliud Kipchoge. “ I have always admired Kipchoge and I want to be like him,” he said while revealing that this is his first major breakthrough and feels he still has a lot to offer. He said for him, tactics carried the day, and praised the coaches for doing a fantastic job during their training stint at Kigari Teachers College. “ I never felt the uphills because I was ready and had a strategy. Downhill I tried to relax and reserve energy to tackle the hilly situation because I knew both the Ethiopians and Ugandans were a major threat,” he added. Reynolds Kipkorir ensured Kenya bagged gold and silver by returning second in 24.30 while Ethiopia’s Boki Diriba spoiled what had looked like a Kenyan sweep by completing the podium in 24:29. It was an East Africa affair all the way to position 15 as Uganda’s Dancan Kibet placed fourth in 24:36. Ethiopia’s Bereket Zeleke (24:51), Uganda’s Keneth Kiprop (24:52) and Ethiopia’s Abel Bekele (24:51) followed in that order. Other Kenyans Dennis Mutuku (25:13) and Daniel Kinyanjui (25:17) closed the top 10 positions. Ethiopians dominated the women's race, taking the first two positions through Senayet Getachew (20:53) and Medina Elsa (21:003). Kenya's Pamela Kosgei settled for bronze. Faith Cherotich finished fourth in 21:10 while Joyline Chepkermoi was sixth in 21:17 with Ethiopian Lemlem Nibret separating them in 21:16 in fifth place.
