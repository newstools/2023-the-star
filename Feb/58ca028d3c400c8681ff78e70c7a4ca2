The Kenya Urban Roads Authority has announced another two-day traffic disruption. According to the authority, this will be to allow the contractor working on the road to lay the final surface layer. It will begin on Thursday at 6 am and end on Friday at 6 pm. "We wish to notify the general public that there will be traffic disruption along Eastern Bypass from 6 am Thursday 2 to February 3, till 6 pm.Â  This is to allow the contractor to lay the final surface dressing at the section between Embakasi Barracks and CRBC site camp," the notice reads. Kura urged motorists to be cautious when they approach the area earmarked for construction. The announcement comes barely a week after Kura announced another three-day disruption. The Sunday notice had announced a disruption on one side of the same road. The expansion of the Eastern Bypass into a dual carriageway at Sh12.5 billion started in November 2021. The disruption means that motorists will share one lane along the affected section. Kura said traffic marshals and police will be on-site to guide motorists to enable a smooth flow of traffic.
