Patients with broken limbs at Thika Level 5 Hospital have called for help after staying at the facility for months waiting for bone plates. They said despite paying for the bone plates months ago, the facility was hesitant to explain how soon they will be attended to. Reports indicate the supplier cut off deliveries to the county over Sh9 million arrears. A visit to the hospital revealed a sorry state of affairs; the limbs of some of the patients are distorted, others are bandaged and others are encased in plaster. Sospeter Kamotho broke his leg in three different places and suffered a disjointed arm when he was involved in a motorcycle accident onÂ January 16. Kamotho is on medication as he waits for the plates, which he says he paid for through the hospital. Kamotho said he spends Sh500 daily on painkillers, which he buys from outside as the hospital lacks drugs. Peter Karanja was admitted to the facility in December and was told that a shipment was on its way. He is still waiting for it to arrive. The issue has prompted the intervention of health stakeholders, led by chairman Paul Jomo, who termed the situation shameful and unfortunate. He called on Kiambu Governor Kimani Wamatangi and local leaders to address the issue with the urgency it deserves before the situation worsens. Jomo further called on the national government to intervene to save the poor from more suffering. Alice Njoki and Patron Githinji said accident victims should be allowed to buy their own bone plates rather than pay hospitals for them. They urged Wamatangi to waive the patients' bills accrued as they wait in the wards for the plates, saying the inefficiency of the hospital administration is to blame. Health executive Elias Maina said he was newly appointed to the docket and promised to streamline operations once he familiarises himself with the job. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
