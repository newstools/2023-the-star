Kilele Health Association, a health NGO, has rolled out an initiative to reach four million women and girls by 2027 in an effort to eliminate cervical cancer in the country. The NGO works with survivors and caregivers to address quality of life in cancer survivorship. It aims to support the government's agenda towards attaining the 90-70-90 cervical cancer elimination targets. This means at least 90 percent of girls in the country aged between nine to 14 years are reached with the HPV vaccine. 70 percent of women aged 35 to 45 years are screened and 90 percent of those found with lesions are put on treatment. Under the initiative, Kilele Health is seeking to work with partners to sustain HPV vaccination and screening campaign. Kilele Health Executive Director Benda Kithaka, this will be done through community engagement, HPV vaccination and screening outreaches, resource mobilisation and advocacy as well as monitoring and evaluation of milestones attained. This is to be achieved between January 2023 and December 2027. According to the head National Cancer Control Programme at the ministry Mary Nyangasi, awareness levels against cervical cancer are high but women don't take action to get screened. "There is disparity because of stigma. So even though data shows that around 60 percent of our women know about cervical cancer, coming out to get screened still remains a challenge," Nyangasi said.
