Kenya Defence Forces stamped an advert allegedly advertising for job vacancy at the Defence Force Canteen Organisation as fake. The fake letter was circulating on social media with in-depth details of the process of the qualifications. The qualifications were: One should be a Kenyan citizen holding no dual citizenship, one must be between 18 to 29 years. Interested persons should have no criminal records or pending case in court. In academics, one must have at least a D plain in secondary school. The advert also noted that graduates and those from the National Youth Service (NYS) will be prioritised. The advert also had the salary that applicants would get if they applied for different positions. An email where interested parties are to send Curriculum Vitaes was also provided with the deadline being December 9, 2022. The KDF took to its official Twitter account to warn members of the public that there were no job vacancies in their ministry. The KDF made it clear that they only do advertisements on the mainstream media, newspapers, their website and their official Twitter and Facebook accounts. “Members of the public are notified that DEFCO is not hiring. Always verify information on employment or tender advertisements by MoD on our social media pages or contact the Ministry of Defence,” they tweeted.
