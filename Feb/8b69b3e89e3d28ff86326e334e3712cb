On Wednesday, police raided, or attempted to raid, the Karen house of Fred Matiang'i, according to the former Interior CS. Various security agencies including the DPP, DCI, EACC and regular police have hotly denied any involvement. Matiang'i's lawyer alleged that five police vehicles backed off  after the arrival of media and politicians including Raila Odinga around 10pm. Matiang'i, or his lawyers, should produce more physical evidence of the raid. He should provide photos of the police officers involved, either at his house, or from CCTV at the gate of the estate, or from the media who allegedly went there. Otherwise it will be unclear whether the alleged raid took place at all. Similarly, Raila claims that he has video evidence that IEBC chairman Chebukati mysteriously visited him three days before the August 9 presidential election. Chebukati denied that this ever happened and threatened to sue. Raila has refused to release the video. Moreover Charles Hornsby has comprehensively debunked the whistleblower report on the 2022 presidential election as a forgery. There is therefore a reasonable suspicion that a disinformation campaign is underway to delegitimise the government. Matiang'i should now provide concrete evidence that this raid took place.
