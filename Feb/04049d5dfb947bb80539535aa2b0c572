In less than 24 hours, Africa 100m record holder Ferdinand Omanyala set two world leading times following his victory at the second leg of Athletics Kenya track and field weekend meet at the Nyayo National stadium on Saturday evening. The reigning Commonwealth Games 100m champion set a new lead of 9.81 to erase the 9.86 time he set on Friday at the same venue. Omanyala beat Samuel Imeta to second place in 9.94 seconds and South Africa's Henricho Brhintes to third in 10.22. The African champion promised on Friday that he would lower his time that works for him well. "As a man you must walk the talk and I said I will lower my time and I did it in style today. For now I'm on the right track because I'm targeting the world championships and the Diamond League final. What is remaining is to maintain the course so that Budapest finds us in the same shape,” Omanyala said after the victory. He said that he will be out training before resurfacing in South Africa for two races and coming back for Kipkeino Classic. “I'm going off for a month and half months just training because my next race is in South Africa then Botswana Continental Tour then Kip Keino Classic tour in Kenya,” he said. In women's 100m, Maximilla Imali was victorious after timing 11.32 ahead of Ugandan Nyamangwe Jacent (11.64) and Esther Mbagari (11.72). Former world under 20 3,000m bronze medalist Simon Kiprop Koech and upstart Emmanuel Korir Kiplagat were the winners in the men’s 3,000m steeplechase and 10,000m titles respectively. In one of the fastest heat finals, Koech renewed his rivalry with 2021 World under 20 3,000m steeplechase champion Amos Serem in the heat that also featured former world under 20 3,000m silver medalist Leonard Kipkemboi Bett. The day belonged to Nandi-based Koech who edged out his able competitors for the title in 28:26.85 in one of the fastest heats. The Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) runner said that winning was not easy after battling out with top athletes in the water and barriers. “This was hard for me now that we ran without knowing who would win. But coming as a winner was the best fruit for me,” said Koech, who will be battling for a World championship slot in Budapest. Serem, who has been training well in Uasin Gishu county was second in the heat and final when he clocked 8:29.73 with Bett all the way from Bomet county was third after clocking 8:31.55.
