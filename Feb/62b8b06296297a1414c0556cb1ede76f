Azimio la Umoja will not suspend the planned rallies against President William Ruto's administration, NarcK leader Martha Karua said on Saturday. Speaking during the Kisumu rally, she said they will not stop until they achieve their mission. Telling off those condemning it, Karua stated that their meetings are peaceful and people-driven. She said contrary to claims by their opponents that they are demonstrations so as to create fear, all their past rallies have been peaceful. Karua urged their supporters to stand firm and avoid being intimidated. “Mikutano yetu ni ya amani so I want to warn the prophets of doom wale wanaambia watu ni maandamano...na maandamano si mbaya, wanaelezea watu hivyo ndiyo waogope wakifikiria kweli ni vurugu,” she said. (Our meetings are peaceful so I want to warn the prophets of doom those telling people it's a protest... and protesting is not bad, they tell people that make them we mean harm.) “We have done 10 peaceful meetings and our campaigns were peaceful and we are going to take back people’s power peacefully.” Karua at the same time insisted that as a Coalition they are not going to take part in the constitution of IEBC, sentiments echoed by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. “We are not going to allow them to form a William commission, we are going to use our power to reject it.”
