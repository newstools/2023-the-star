The inaugural Magwagwa cross country in Nyamira County initially slated for March 3 has been moved to March 5. The event is organised and sponsored by Gusii Legends Sports Welfare Society. The society's secretary general, Edwin Nyakeriga, said they moved the event to a Sunday to accommodate students. He said they expect a huge turnout for the event which will take place at Esanige playground, featuring six categories. These include 2k for kids aged 7-12 years, 6km junior women, 8km junior men and 10km for senior women and men. There will also be a race for disabled persons. Nyakeriga said there will be incentives for all top performers in the various categories. “The incentives will boost the morale and encourage them to train hard ahead of future competitions,” said Nyakeriga. “We shall use the event to scout for athletes whom we shall nurture to acquire national and international exposure. We are determined to restore Kisii and Nyamira counties’ lost glory in athletics.” The event will also be used to sensitise athletes on the dangers of doping. “Doping is a big problem in Kenya at the moment and there is need to sensitise upcoming athletes on the effects of the menace,” he noted. Other events lined up by the legends include the Nyantika Maiyoro 10km race in Kisii town on March 26, the Naftali Temu Memorial Cross County in Nyamira on May 15 and Motonto Cross Country in Kisii on June 11. The Robert Omwanza Memorial race will be held on August 20 in Kisii County before the series conclude with the Robert Ouko Sports Day to be held at Manga in Nyamira on December 7.
