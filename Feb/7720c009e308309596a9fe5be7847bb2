The inclusion of prizes in the Nairobi Branch volleyball tournament next month will encourage more teams to enroll for the competition, vice chairman of the Kenya Volleyball Federation Nairobi Branch Thomas Moek has said. The two-day competition will be held on March 4-5 at Eastleigh High School rather than the University of Nairobi grounds as earlier communicated. Moek who doubles up as the team manager for league newbies Post Bank who play in the women's league said the exact amount of money the winners will pocket will be known today after the executive meeting. "Money does wonders. We hope by rewarding best performing teams after the competition will enable us to have more teams register for the championship. Registration is currently on-going," Moek said. This is the first tournament the branch is holding this year. "We are having a meeting to iron out the last details and cash awards will be part of the discussion." The first leg of the women's league was held last weekend at the Nyayo stadium. The men's second leg was played mid-month. "The month has been a beehive of activity. The ladies played just the other day. You know normally players need about one week to recover. We hope by the time the competition takes place, the players will be in their best physical condition," Moek said. The categories of the competition include; primary schools, secondary schools, universities and colleges, teams playing in the national league and self-supporting clubs. The branch leadership has Moses Mbuthia as the chairman. Moek is the first vice chair while Kenya Defense Forces coach Elisha Aliwa takes the second vice chair position. Michael Njoroge is the treasurer. Moses Kimani, KCB team manager, is the secretary.
