Bunyore Starlets coach Daniel Arunga has urged his side not to drop any point in their remaining two first-leg matches. Arunga said maximum six points will push the Vihiga-based side into the top four, which will boost their morale heading into the business end of the Football Kenya Federation Kenya Women's Premier League. "Ending the first leg in the top-four will put us in good stead heading into the second leg," Arunga said. "As a coach, I have done all what is needed together, alongside my assistant and the technical bench. We feel we are ready to pick the six points," he added. Bunyore Starlet are currently fifth with 16 points three behind leaders Vihiga Queens while Gaspo and Thika Queens are second with 18 points each.Â Nakuru are fourth with 17. Arunga said the club is currently in fine form and all the players are fit for the match. "The break we had has helped since it created room for some players to recover from some minor injuries they had," he posed. "Susan Muhonja is back from the injury, Priscah Ambale is also back from the suspension so we are fit to go," the tactician said. In other matches, Thika Queens will be up against Kayole Starlets, Gaspo face Wadadia, Ulinzi Starlets entertain Kangemi Ladies and Kisumu All Starlets welcome Zetech.
