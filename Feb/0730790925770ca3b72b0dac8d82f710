Embakasi East MP Babu Owino says he will mobilise University students across all the 47 counties to fight for their rights. The lawmaker said he won't assure the head of state whether the demonstrations will be peaceful or not but he will rally the learners to take to the streets. "Learners should be out to fight for their rights," the outspoken youthful MP said. He spoke on Saturday in Vihiga county at Esiandumba grounds during the homecoming party of Luanda MP Dick Maungu. The lawmaker's sentiments come as the Azimio leaders led by Raila Odinga have called on the government to reconsider its plan to increase university tuition fees. The government issued a directive to increase the fee from the current sh16,000 to sh48,000. This came after the High Education Loans Board subsides were removed. The Embakasi MP also spoke on the high cost of living saying Kenya has capacity to sustain itself by producing sufficient food supplies. "Kenya iko na upuzi, we can't be praying for rains on Valentine's Day, when a country in a desert is producing millions of turns of wheat for export," Babu said. The lawmaker said the nation must invest in irrigation for the nation to have enough food.
