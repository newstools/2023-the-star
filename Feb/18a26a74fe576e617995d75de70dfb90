A funeral mob has razed down two homesteads at Nyamesocho in Masaba South in Kisii following the killing of a reveller in the area a fortnight ago. The party was returning home Thursday evening with the body of Boaz Orina but before reaching home, armed youth commandeered vehicles to the scene and razed down the houses. At a suspected chang'aa den, they demolished a shop and set a family house on fire. They further razed down another house owned by one villager believed to be the primary suspect in the gory killing of the deceased. Officers from Ramasha visited the scenes hours after the destruction. Orina's body was discovered sprawling along the path next to the suspected Changaa den two weeks ago. He was spotted partying at Nyagentinge Changaa den where the body was found. Thomas Ongoge, a local said the houses belong to Matara Omwoyo and Nyagentinge Nyansikera.
