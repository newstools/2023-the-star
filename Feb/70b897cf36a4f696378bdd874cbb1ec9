A Homa Bay contractor has expressed his dissatisfaction with the county governemnt over unpaid dues. Onyango Methosela constructed four pit latrines for the county government at Lwanda Nyamasare trading centre in Kasgunga, Suba North. However, Methosela locked the latrine doors on Monday to show his dissatisfaction. He is among the contractors who have not been paid since they completed the work in 2018. Methosela is demanding Sh500,000 for constructing the pit latrines. “I should have been paid long ago because I completed the work on time. But, unfortunately, the payment has been turned into protracted squabbles,” Methosela said. The businessman said he had sent in vain requisitions for payment to the Trade Homa Bay department. Methosela claims the county government was giving them deaf years despite having cleared the work five years ago. A letter to the county government with demands for payment wanted the devolved unit to respond within five days before the contractor resorted to closing the facilities. “I have provided all the relevant documents to Homa Bay government officers concerned. The doors of the pit latrines have been closed after the government failed to give reasons why they have not paid me,” he said. He said the latrines will remain closed until he is paid. Methosela said his properties are in danger of being auctioned by banks that provided resources to enable him to undertake the work. He said his company is likely to get declared bankrupt due to increasing interest as he is unable to repay the loans. However, the Trade Chief Officer Joshua Orero said he was ready for dialogue with the contractor if he unlocks the doors. Orero said he has received the complaints and would respond after the doors are unlocked. “Let the contractor open the doors and come for a conversation on how he can be paid,” Orero said.
