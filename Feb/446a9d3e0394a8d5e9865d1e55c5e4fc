Following a five-year hiatus, the Kenya Open tennis championship will return in June. The tournament will run concurrently with the Kenya Junior Open. Tennis Kenya secretary General Wanjiku Mbugua-Karani said the tournament has not been held due to a combination of factors. "It's been quite challenging. From lack of sponsorships to the Covid-19 in 2020 but I am confident that we will stage the event this year. The tournament has been our flagship competition for the last thirty years," said Karani. The tournament was last held in 2018 with Wimbledon doubles junior champion Angela Okutoyi and Ismael Changawa claiming the titles. Karani, a former international, expects new stars to emerge at this year's edition. "We have a good crop of players coming through the junior tennis initiatives including Albert Njogu, Derrick Ominde, Kael Shah and many others. I expect a competitive tournament in both the men and women's categories,” added Karani. Karani said they are keen to welcome international players from Africa and beyond, adding that they hope to firm up on some sponsorships in the next couple of months. "It's something we are working on as federation and I am confident we will get some sponsorships, enough to allow us host a successful event,” added Karani. Meanwhile, Karani revealed they are making plans to send a team to the Africa beach games in Tunisia in August. Other highlights of the year will include Tennis Kenya Junior Series 14 and under championship which will be open to all affiliates. Other off-field events will be the regional coaches' workshop in November, the ITF Level 2 School Officiating Course and the Tennis Kenya Annual General Meeting.
