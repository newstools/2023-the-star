Lawyer Miguna Miguna has urged President William Ruto not to interfere with Azimio rallies. In a statement on Sunday, Miguna said as long as the protests are peaceful, they should go on. The outspoken lawyer said the Azimio rallies add colour to the Kenyan poplitics. "To President William Ruto. Make sure that Raila Odinga isn’t arrested or prevented from holding his useless rallies," he said. "Let him hold as many rallies as he wants. Their noise adds political colour!" Miguna's remarks were in response to the unveiling of a new youth movement by Raila. During the Azimio rally at Kamukunji grounds in Kibra on Sunday, the former Prime Minister unveiled a new youth movement called Movement for Defence of Democracy with its officials wearing what appeared to be jungle camouflage. Raila gave the clearest indication that his plan is to scale up anti-government protests. He revealed that more anti-Ruto rallies will come and announced a "Ruto must go" slogan in what portends protracted political war. “Our stand remains that Ruto did not win the elections. He got into State House by hijacking and subverting the will of the people. He must get out,” he the former Prime Minister said. On Thursday last week, the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) said the rallies were causing political tension. They also called on Azimio leader Raila Odinga to stop his planned political rallies forthwith. The Commission also warned anyone taking advantage of the public rallies to spread hate speech, saying they will be dealt with at an individual level. "The rallies that were held recently saw a spike in hate speech and misinformation, a move likely to get out of hand if unchecked," NCIC chairperson Samuel Kobia said. He said in January alone, there were ten hate speech cases and 20 misinformation cases which had been recorded and are being investigated by the commission.
