Popular entertainer, Benson Ouma alias DJ Lastborn is dead. News of his death broke on Friday as his fans celebrated him. Media personality Njambi Koikai aka Fyah Mummah remembered DJ Lastborn as a person who made her dream in the reggae industry a reality. "There was reggae played everywhere in town. Two friends came up with a different style, and started jam sessions in Nyanza House (DJ Lastborn and Simple Simon). Then came the Missile mixtapes, DJ Lastborn in the mix. Then he started touring internationally and made some of us dream that we could make it with reggae. Black Supremacy was the biggest and baddest sound system,” Njambi wrote on her social media platforms. Njambi added that; "Many of us from that era, have had our fair share of life lessons and experiences from serious health issues to the evolution of the industry. I pray for grace, strength, and God’s guidance. Fare thee well LB. May the Most High God rest your soul in eternal perfect peace." He had been ailing since 2021 after suffering a stroke that affected the right side of his body. The second stroke made him lose his speech and also affected his right eye. _jonyango: Golden days of Nyanza house jam sessions.
