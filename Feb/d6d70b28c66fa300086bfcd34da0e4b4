Boundaries are essential in our everyday interactions. They are limits we set on different areas of our lives; they allow our relationships (with our partners, friendships, and family) to flourish. Sometimes it might be difficult to set a boundary and even more difficult to communicate the boundary. Boundaries can be classified into the following categories. Physical boundaries These are boundaries to protect your space and body. They communicate to others how close they can get to you, and if any physical touch is allowed. They also let people know how to behave in their personal space. Emotional/Mental boundaries They protect your feelings and thoughts from being invalidated. Â They create room for accountability for your own emotions and thoughts. Sexual boundaries Here your consent is communicated. Who you want to be intimate with, and the kind of intimacy you want. Spiritual/Religious boundaries Under this category, boundaries set allow you to worship/believe in who/what you chose to and practice your beliefs without trying to convince others that their religion/beliefs are not right. Time boundaries They protect how you spend your time. Thus you will not agree to do things that you do not want to do. Non-negotiable boundaries These are essentially deal breakers.
