The keenly awaited round of 17 Kenyan Premier League match between KCB and AFC Leopards has a new date and location. The tie, which was originally scheduled to take place at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday, will now be held at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Sunday. The clash is among the nine matches slated for this weekend with the competition having already entered its crucial phases. The third-placed bankers will try to knock K'Ogalo off the top of the leaderboard to increase their chances of winning their first top-flight championship. On the other hand, AFC Leopards have had a difficult season and are currently in the bottom half of the standings. They have, however, displayed glimmers of their potential and will be aiming to pull off a surprise against their highly fancied opponents. The first game of the weekend's action is another thrilling match between Kariobangi Sharks and Sofapaka FC at Kasarani Annex Saturday afternoon.
