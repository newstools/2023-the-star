Claims on social media that Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commissioner Irene Masit has resigned are false. Sections of people on social media were saying Masit has resigned after two IEBC commissioners resigned. “The last standing of Cherera four Irene Masit has finally resigned from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC),” one of the Facebook users posted. The fact-checker has established that Masit did not resign as her lawyer Donald Kipkorir posted otherwise. Kipkorir has dismissed the reports that commissioner Masit has resigned. In a statement, Kipkorir who is representing Masit said they have filed a petition against the ouster process. "IEBC Irene Masit has given me firm instructions to quash her unconstitutional impeachment proceedings by Writ of Certiorari. We have already filed a Constitutional Petition in High Court, Nairobi," he tweeted. "Any reports that she has resigned are the work of political brokers and idlers," Kipkorir added.
