ODM leader Raila Odinga and team visited Kisii on Friday and vowed to scale up the fight against what they termed as injustices in President William Ruto's government. The ODM leader criticised Ruto for attempting to bring back one party rule in the country by killing the opposition as he tries to tighten his grip in power. "We are not going to stand by and watch these absurdity go on, we must shout as a people ," he told the crowd. He said multipartism has its place in the country and must be protected at all cost. Raila vowed that they would not relent in their push for countrywide people's rallies against the Kenya Kwanza regime. He spoke against high handedness in the raid of former Interior CS Fred Matiangi's residence saying it signals a relapse to dictatorship. Raila said Kenya is not a police state but one that should be ruled by law. "We are not in any state of emergency to warrant the treatment of Matiang'i as a criminal. If there are genuine charges then he should be summoned and a duly process be followed but not harassing him,"Raila said. The ODM leader further said the push for heavy taxation by Ruto was the cause number one of poverty among the masses. He said if the trend is not stopped, it will derail efforts made at improving livelihoods among Kenyans. "Our people deserve good life which is not being enjoyed in an atmosphere of heavy prices for basic commodities," Raila said. Raila was accompanied by Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Mysyoka and Narc Kenya Party boss Martha Karua. Others were Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko and former Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya They spoke of the need for bigger democratic space, free, fair and transparent polls in the country. A section of Azimio foot soldiers in the region, however, snubbed theÂ  fairly attended and charged rally at the Gusii stadium. Senator Richard Onyonka , Anthony Kobagendi (MP, Kitutu Chache South) and Daniel Manduku (Nyatibari Masaba) skipped the function.
