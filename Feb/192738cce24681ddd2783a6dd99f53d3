Azimio leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday met with Suna East MP Junet Mohamed and former Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. The meeting comes after speculations from Kenyans following their missing in action at Raila's protest rallies against President William Ruto's regime. Raila has now clarified that the two are part of his team. "Had a refreshing lunch with my brothers. Tuko Imara!" Raila said. Junet and Joho have stayed off the political limelight since Raila lost the August 2022 presidential elections. The opposition leader has held three rallies in protest of President William Ruto's leadership, all of which, the two have missed.
