Tana River Senator Danson Mungatana has expressed his dismay over the direction the political banter is taking in Kenya. Speaking on Monday, he said that elected leaders had forgotten their purpose and diverted to polity engagements. "My biggest disappointment is that our country is still talking about politics and lost elections, yet the big issue is drought," Mungatana said. The Senator opined that the opposition was out of touch as they were more focused on politics instead of pushing the government to address the challenges facing Kenyans. He said that the opposition should read the mood of the country and push the government towards setting up more irrigation schemes, drilling boreholes and adapting to climate change to enhance food security. "Don't stand out there and tell us your election was stolen, who cares? Many people are hungry. These are things that should take our time," Mungatana said. "It's really disappointing that leaders have lost track of leading people yet politics does not put food on the table, nor heal the sick." On Sunday, Trans Nzoia Governor George Natembeya called on leaders to cease from August 2022 election talks. He said that the exercise was overtaken by events and Kenya has a sitting President who was declared by IEBC and affirmed by the Supreme Court. "In this time under President William Ruto let us cease discussing leaders and elections. Elections ended and IEBC declared the winner. which was affirmed by the Supreme Court," Natembeya said. The governor said that Ruto cannot be removed from the seat and that should encourage leaders to work towards supporting the government. "Ni jambo gani lingine linaweza kufanyika ambalo litaondoa huyu rais kwa kiti? Tusipoteze mda tukiongea, Rais ako kwa kiti imara," Natembeya said. This translates to; "What situation can make Ruto be removed from the presidency? Let us not waste time with election talks as Ruto is firmly seated in the presidency seat."
