A lot of young girls are seeking vaginal rejuvenation and egg-freezing services, a doctor has revealed. Doctor Sarita Sukhija, an IVF and fertility specialist in Nairobi, said that patients on the fertility journey are looking for such services, including InVitro Fertilisation (IVF) services. Dr Sarita said that a lot of young girls are demanding these services. Vaginal rejuvenationÂ consists of surgical and nonsurgical treatments that firm up the skin around your vagina or tighten the vaginal canal. "Girls who went through Female Genital Mutilation/ Cutting (FGM/C) can particularly benefit from this procedure," she said. Dr Sarita was speaking at the one-year anniversary celebration of her Myra IVF Medical Center in Parklands, Nairobi. "This is something that is very close to my heart," she said. She said that women come to her at a very old age, from 40 to 42 years, with fertility issues. "The other thing that I'm keen to start is cosmetic gynecology including vaginal rejuvenation and angioplasty," she said. Dr Sarita, however, said there is still a lot of stigma surrounding fertility, with heavy blame being put on women. Kemunto Mageria from Myra IVF, said that 10 per cent of the entire Kenyan population, according to the 2022 Demographic Health Survey, are suffering from infertility. "So we are here to increase the awareness and create awareness about infertility. Let's try to reduce the stigma associated with infertility," she said.
