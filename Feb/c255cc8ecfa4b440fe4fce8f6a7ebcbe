Lang’ata MP Felix Odiwuor alias Jalang’o has broken his silence on his visit to the State House on Tuesday. The legislature was among the nine ODM MPs who held a meeting with President William Ruto at State House, Nairobi. Through his Twitter handle, Odiwuor said he was following up on the affordable housing in the Highrise ward in his constituency. “Today we had breakfast with the President, I followed up on the Start date of the construction of affordable housing in the Highrise ward and the completion of the Langata TVET,” he said. The MP added: “The project is on and the contractor is on the ground, an extra Sh50 million has been located for the completion.” The others who went to State House include Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Caroli Omondi (Suba South), Shakeel Shabir (Kisumu East, Independent), Paul Abuor (Rongo), John Owino (Awendo) and Kisumu Senator Tom Ojienda. ODM has blasted the nine MPs for holding a meeting with President Ruto. The party director of communications Philip Etale said that the meeting by the MPs was no surprise for them and the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition. "The party has been monitoring closely the behind-the-scenes activities involving some of them and today was just the climax," he said in a statement. Etale termed the State House meetings as a tactic to divert the nation's attention from the high cost of living, unbearable school fees for their children and corruption.
