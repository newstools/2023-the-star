The commissioning of the Cyberknife, a machine used in the treatment of cancer might take longer. This is after the Kenyatta Referral Teaching, Referral and Research hospital revealed the installation is taking longer due to the complexity of the process. The machine was brought into the country in October last year The installation process had been estimated to take 60 days as advised by the manufacturer since the arrival of the machine. The first patient was therefore expected to be treated on December 15 the date when the machine had been expected to be commissioned. “The engineers assured us the installation is on schedule for commissioning soon,” the KUTRRH board chair Prof Olive Mugenda said when she inspected the process. “The project has taken a little longer than expected due to the complexity and safety of the bunker. Glad it's now on course.” Cyberknife, the latest technology that conducts non-invasive treatment for cancerous and non-cancerous tumours, will be housed at Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital. The machine uses advanced technology to track tumours anywhere in the body, with treatments conducted in one to five sessions. The machine, which was acquired at Sh675 million, has the capacity to attend to 20 patients per day. “The cost of treatment will be about Sh350,000. The good news is that we have spoken to NHIF and will be covering the cost of the whole treatment,” she said. The machine's unique robotic design keeps radiation on target even as the tumour moves and can be used as an alternative to surgery or for patients with inoperable or surgically complex tumours. The machine will be able to get to some organs which experts are not able to get to with the other machines due to its capability to turn around 360 degrees. Kenya is Africa's second country after Egypt to acquire the machine.
