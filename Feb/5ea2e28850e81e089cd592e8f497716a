Aakif Virani has revealed his aspirations to drive the third generation Skoda Fabia Supercar as his preparations for the 2023 season gather momentum. The Nairobi-based driver has over the years had a penchant for Skodas and still retains the Octavia rally car that he previously ran in the local series. “The Skoda Octavia is now a collector’s car. I have two Rally2 Skodas of the current generation. But I have ordered the latest one which is the third generation. My order is on the waiting list. It could take like eight months or even more,” said Virani, the 2021 Motor Sports Personality of the Year. Virani has also revealed his plans of tackling the full season of the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC), which includes ARC Equator Rally on March 18-19 as well as the World rally Championships Safari Rally in June. It was confirmed last week that Kenya’s ARC gravel fixture will continue as planned, preceded by the season-opening Rallye Bandama of Ivory Coast later this month. The Equator Rally will be organised by Sikh Union Club. Virani took part in the season-opening RSC Machakos Rally at Lisa Farm, where he retired in his ex-Manvir Baryan Skoda Fabia Rally 2 machine. “The Skoda was relatively clean after the last event in Machakos but we’ve resorted to an approach of checking everything again. Our approach is to take each event with respect and not take anything for granted,” said Virani. “Our pace has increased and our ambitions are still humble, considering there is everything to play for in all the championships and the Safari. “Skoda is one of the best manufacturers of pure racing machines having won the majority of the championships in Europe. The new third generation Rally2 is looking interesting.” Virani’s Skoda project is a significant milestone given that he will be among the first in Africa to pilot the third generation car.
