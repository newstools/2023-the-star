Tanzanian singer Mavokali is said to be the latest artiste signed by Diamond Platnumz under his record label WCB. In an interview with Wasafi, the 'Mapopo' hitmaker was coy on whether he had joined WCB. "For that particular question, I will have to say no comment," he said. "What I have done is a dream come true. People should just wait. What is in secret sometimes is a blessing. I just want to work hard." Mavokali deleted all his social media posts once the rumours of being signed by the singer came out. "There are new things that have come with rules and I need to be able to follow." On Thursday, Diamond posted a section of the contract dated February 2, 2023. Mavokali also posted ‘Deal Done 02/02/2023’ at the same time.
