Azimio leader Raila Odinga has listed a number of issues he says are the most pressing to Kenyans and should be urgently addressed by President William Ruto. In an interview on KTN Tuesday night, Raila said that Ruto must first agree to open the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission servers. "You must stop the recruitment of IEBC commissioners, there is the issue of cost of living in the country. You must address because Kenyans are suffering," he said. Raila, however, said that there is no basis for talks with Ruto. He said that there must be negotiations for the appointment of the commissioners of the electoral agency. Raila said that the commissioners cannot be appointed by one side. He said all stakeholders must be involved in the selection process of the new commissioners. The Azimio leader has on several occasions challenged IEBC to challenge the alleged whistleblower's results by opening the servers. "Why are they reluctant to open the servers?” Raila asked. In January, Raila claimed they have official presidential results, contrary to those declared by former IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati. He claimed that a whistleblower who worked for the IEBC then provided them with evidence that Raila won the election. "The data released by the whistleblower is a bombshell that compels every Kenyan of goodwill to ask themselves if indeed we still have a democracy," Azimio leaders said in January. The dossier claimed Raila garnered 8,170,355 votes or 57.53 per cent of votes cast against President William Ruto's 5,915,973 votes (41.66 per cent of votes cast).
