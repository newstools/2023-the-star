Police are investigating an incident in which a law student at the University of Nairobi was found dead in her room in Parklands, Nairobi. The body of the fourth-year student Teresia Wawira Ndwiga was found in her room on Sunday, February 12 with a white bloody substance oozing from her nose. She was alone at the time of the discovery of the body, police said. Police said they were called and informed the deceased’s room had been locked from the inside and she was missing. Her roommate said she was away for the weekend and when she came back she found the room locked from the inside. She knocked but there was no response. It was then she contacted the guards on duty who peeped and saw the naked body lying on the floor. Police arrived and broke in and established the body was naked and there was a white bloody substance oozing from her nose. Nairobi police boss Adamson Bungei said there were no visible marks on the body of the girl. “We do not know what caused her death but investigations are ongoing,” he said. He added a postmortem will be conducted on the body as part of the probe into the incident. The body was moved to the mortuary. Meanwhile, a man died after being buried alive while digging a trench in Zimmerman area, Nairobi. John Binyige Simangwi 40, was among a group digging a trench at a construction site on Sunday when the wall collapsed on them. The workers had dug almost seven feet deep and were preparing to leave when the wall collapsed. It trapped the victim inside and by the time they dug to save him, he had succumbed. Police arrived at the scene and found the workers had retrieved the body and took it to the mortuary. Bungei said they are investigating the incident. He asked contractors to always ensure their workers are safe while on duty.
