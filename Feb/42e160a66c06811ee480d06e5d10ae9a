Christians around the globe have marked the first day of the Lenten period in preparation for the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Ash Wednesday is considered a holy day of prayer and fasting. The lent season runs up to 40 days. The day is marked by Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists and Presbyterians. During this period, believers fast and repent, some denominations focus on the abstinence of meat although it is now extended into people giving up some of their favourite things and certain habits. Lent season begins on February 22 and will end on April 2. According to Wikipedia, the name Ash Wednesday derives from the placing of repentance ashes on the foreheads of participants to either the words "Repent, and believe in the Gospel" or the dictum "Remember that you are dust, and to dust, you shall return." In the Christian calendar, it is preceded by Shrove Tuesday and falls on the first day of the six weeks of penitence before Easter.
