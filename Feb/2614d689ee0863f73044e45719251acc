Kennedy Rapudo, fiance of Kenyan socialite Amber Ray, says public life was tough at the beginning of their dating. Speaking during a Q and A segment on Amber's YouTube channel, the businessman said his 'peaceful' life was disrupted after announcing they were an item. "I did not have people snooping in my life. It caused me a lot of mental anguish because people mostly focus on the negative," he said. He said he has since grown a thick skin. "The more you pay attention to the critics, the more it distracts you. I have learned to live my own life." He said Amber Ray had warned him about going public without knowing what he was getting himself into. Amber Ray said her life is always under scrutiny. "I knew he is very private, and things would be tough for him," she said.
