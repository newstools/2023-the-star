Your skin type determines the body care products you need to choose for your skincare routine and make up. Skin types normally fall into various categories and they all require specific care routines and products. We have normal, dry, oily and combination skin types. Some skin types tend to be prone to acne or are sensitive to certain skin products. Skin types vary depending on one's lifestyle, genetics, sleep patterns andÂ  diet. The amount of sebum (an oily substance produced in the sebaceous glands) is what usually determines whether one has oily, dry or combination skin type. To know your skin type, follow the following procedure: Wash your face with a cleanser and wait for 30 minutes. Observe your skin. If your skin is shiny then you have oily skin. If it is tight, and flaky then you have dry skin. If the forehead, chin, cheeks, and nose are shiny, that is the T-zone then you have combination skin. If your skin feels comfortable and not oily then you have normal skin. All the skin types can develop pimples or dark spots depending on one's care routine. Your skin is sensitive if there are products that make your skin itchy, red or flushed.
