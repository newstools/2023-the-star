Poison beat Akiba 2-1 to lift the inaugural BetNare seven-a-side title at the Kongoni grounds in South C, Nairobi. The tournament, which also marked the launch of the company's Corporate Social Responsibility activities saw Wilson hammer South C 3-0 in the girls' final. To reach the final, Poison beat SAAD 8-7 on post match penalties after a barren draw while Akiba were too good for Jua Kali, whom they hammered 6-1 in a one-sided contest. In attendance was the Langata Constituency MP Felix Oduwor "Jalang'o" who promised to use his position to empower the youth in his constituency through sports, culture and arts. "I thank BetNare for coming to sponsor this competition. I also appreciate the fact that they have decided to launch their CSR activities with a football event in my constituency. I promise to work with BetNare and other corporates to help nurture talent and get our young boys and girls out of the streets, away from drugs and other social vices," said Jalang'o. BetNare's Terence Mutongerwa said: "To build a healthy society, our youth must engage in sports. BetNare is here to build a healthy nation by supporting sports. This is just the beggining, we will move to every corner of this country and work with the youth." The winners received cash awards and trophies.
