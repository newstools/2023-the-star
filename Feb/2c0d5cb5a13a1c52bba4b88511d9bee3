A woman has been charged in court for stealing two mobile phones worth Sh300,000 from a guest who had visited a bar to celebrate a birthday party. Gladys Wanjiru Mbugua was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua. She is said to have committed the offence on January 18. The court heard that the phone belongs to Mirriam Ngendo Kihiko who had visited the pub with her friend to celebrate a birthday party. The phone got lost after the complainant and her visitors enjoyed food and drinks at the said pub at around 3 am. The accused person is said to have been arrested after the detectives from Kabete police station visited the pub and reviewed the CCTV footage where she was spotted allegedly stealing the said phones from the handbag. She denied the charges and pleaded for a lenient bond term. Mbugua was released on Sh200,000 bond with a surety of the same amount. The case will proceed later this month for a mention.
