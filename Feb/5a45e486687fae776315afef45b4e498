Most women do appreciate being gifted flowers this Valentine's Day. However, one thing most partners are not aware of is that all these flowers communicate different messages. Some do not pass romantic messages and have different meanings. The following are flowers that you should avoid gifting your loved one this Valentine’s day. 1. Daffodils They come in white, pink, or yellow colours. They are beautiful but they communicate with your vanity or self-absorption. Avoid them this Valentine's Day. 2. Yellow Carnations Yellow is an attractive colour we must agree on that. It’s popping and beautiful. Unless you are rejecting your partner or are disgusted with them, avoid yellow carnations. 3. Lavender Lavender flowers range from pale purple to violet in colour. Lavender scents are to die for. But lavender flowers can break your relationship since they pass the message of mistrust. 4. Aconite They are blue-purple in colour. Do we hate our partners this Valentine’s? If the answer is no, then leave the aconite flowers in the supermarket or at the vendor's shop. They pass on the message of hate and detest. 5. Yellow Chrysanthemums They are often used during sorrowful moments or moments of regret. Therefore, they should be avoided on Valentine's day. 7. Buttercup They can either be yellow or white in colour. Everyone has their inner child and expresses them differently, but no one wants to be made to feel like they can’t make rational decisions. With these flowers, you are telling your partner that they are immature and childish. 8. Butterfly Weed They are orange, in colour. Unless you want to break up with your partner or you want them to leave you instead of telling them straight up, then close your eyes when you see butterfly weed flowers.
