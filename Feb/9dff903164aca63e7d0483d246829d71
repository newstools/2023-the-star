South Africa's state-owned power firm, Eskom, has announced an intensification of its programme of planned power cuts. Supplies will be cut off from 20:00 local time until 05:00. The company said shorter blackouts would then be implemented until further notice. Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster to try to deal with the crisis. Eskom is plagued by corruption, and has an ageing network of poorly maintained coal-fired power stations. There have been power cuts in parts of South Africa every day since the beginning of the year.
