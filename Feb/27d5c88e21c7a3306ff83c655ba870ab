Members of the public are now calling for chiefs in Kuria, Migori county to be held to account for incidences of FGM in the region. In an online petition on change.org, they are saying chiefs should also face the music for cases happening in their jurisdiction. Anti-FGM activists have been speculating that chiefs collude with families to turn a blind eye as harmful cultural practice takes place. They said that Female Genital Mutilation was outlawed in 2011 with stringent deterrent penalties in place to curb the barbaric vice and it cannot be allowed to go unchecked. "Only recently a girl from Kuria, to protect her identity letâ€™s call her Gati, was abducted by her brother after returning home from a rescue centre to collect personal effects and subjected to forceful FGM in the forest," the petition explains. The horrific act has left her mutilated, scarred and traumatised. "Gati was later taken to hospital having lost a vast amount of blood. The perpetrators of the heinous FGM on her are yet to be arrested and charged," they said. Kuria has been constantly in the media and on the radar of Anti-FGM activists for a number of cases. The petition, which has garnered more than 700 signatures since being launched on Monday, also calls for further investigations. "Area DCI should investigate with a view of apprehending the perpetrators and charging them under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2011," they said. February 6, marks International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM. The World Health Organization defines FGM as comprising all procedures that involve the removal of parts of the external female genital organs for non-medical reasons. In Kenya, around four million women and girls have been subjected to FGM. One in five Kenyan women between 15 and 49 years old has been circumcised.
