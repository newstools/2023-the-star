Director of Criminal Investigation Mohamed Amin has confirmed that they have been investigating former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i over the Ruaraka land saga and Huduma Namba rollout. While dismissing Matiang'i's alleged raid at his Karen home on Wednesday night as stage managed, Amin said the probe is still at the preliminary stage. "For the record, I can confirm that none of the cases under investigation so far have reached the stage, which requires the assistance or attendance of Dr Matiang'i," Amin said in a press statement. On Wednesday night, lawyer Danstan Omari claimed that a group of elite police officers from the DCI had been deployed to arrest Matiang'i at his Karen home. He claimed they had reports that the purported arrest was on the Ruaraka land saga and the Huduma Namba rollout which all happened when Matiang'i was in office. "So, I can confirm to every Kenyan in this country that the life of Matiang'i is at risk. We don't know the intention of wanting to invade the home of Matiang'i at this hour of the night," Omari said. He said the former CS was, however, ready to present himself to whichever police station if they have anything to charge him with. "We strongly believe that this country must be governed by the rule of law. We are ready and willing to present Matiang'i to any police station," the lawyer added. Amin, however, dismissed the claims saying no officers from the DCI were deployed to find or arrest Matiang'i at his residence or anywhere else. "DCI treats the allegations of a raid into the home of Dr Matiang'i seriously and has conducted an initial investigation into the matter," Amin said. "Our preliminary findings have uncovered evidence of a well-coordinated and deliberate attempt to spread false information and incite public fear," the DCI boss added.
