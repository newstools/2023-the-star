Defending champion Karan Patel will be the first driver off the ramp in the season-opening RSC Machakos Rally on Sunday. Karan will be navigated by Tauseef Khan in a Ford Fiesta Rally 2, which finished second overall in the FIA African Rally Championship. Last year’s runners up Jasmeet Chana and Ravi Chana are seeded second in their Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 10. Starting this year, the nine-leg KNRC series will feature new categories which are expected to add some zest to the competition. McRae Kimathi and Jeremy Wahome will fight for honours in the new Rally 3 Championship in their Ford Fiesta which they ran in the FIA ARC last year. Karan (Fiesta) and Aakif Virani (Skoda Fabia) will square it out in the newly-introduced Rally 2 Championship which is a preserve of the former R5 cars. Behind the super cars will be a scintillating battle for the 2WD Championship in which Sam Karangatha, in a Subaru Leone, Daren Miranda (Subaru Impreza) and Sameer Nanji (VW Golf MK2) will be in focus. Karangatha exuded confidence, saying: “We hope to enjoy a fun day of rallying in Machakos. For now, we have no plans for the season. We’ll see which events we can manage.” “We are running the Subaru Leone 2WD which we have been preparing with friends. The car is mostly the same as we had it in the 2021 autocross championship with a few additional necessities for rallying.” Seeded entry list Machakos Rally 2023 Round 1 1 #1 Karan Patel /Tauseef Khan (Ford Fiesta Rally2) 2 #2 Jasmeet Chana/ Ravi Chana (Mitsubishi Evolution 10) 3 #6 Aakif Virani /Azhar Bhatti (Skoda Fabia RC2-Rally2) 4 #19 Eric Bengi /Murage Waigwa (Mitsubishi Evolution 10 RC2-R4) 5 #38 Evans Kavisi/ Absalom Aswani (Mitsubishi Evolution 10 RC2-NR4) 6 #14 Issa Amwari /Edward Njoroge (Mitsubishi Evolution 10 RC2-NR4) 7 #8 Jeremiah Wahome /Victor Okundi (Ford Fiesta RC3) 8 #100 Yasin Nasser/Joseph Kamya (Uganda - Ford Fiesta RC2) 9 #21 McRae Kimathi /Mwangi Kioni  ( Ford Fiesta RC3) 10 #16 Kush Patel /Mudasar Chaudry (Subaru Impreza) 11 #34 Rio Smith /Riyaz Ismail (Ford Fiesta RC4-2WD) 12 #55 Rajveer Thethy /Wayne Fernandes  (Subaru Impreza NAT-S+) 13 #32 Edward Maina /Anthony Gichohi (Subaru Impreza NAT-S) 14 #40 Rashminder Bhabra/ Devan Bhundia (Datsun Violet) 15 #29 Daren Miranda/Linet Ayuko (Subaru Impreza) 16 #26 Sam Karangatha/Edward Ndukui (Subaru Leone) 17 #35 Sameer Nanji /Vinay Shah (VW Golf MK2)
