Barely four months after rapper Takeoff’s death, Quavo released his second tribute song, 'Greatness' celebrating his late nephew. The 30-year-old rapper, made the revelation in a tribute song to Takeoff titled 'Greatness' released on February 23,  eliciting shocking reactions from fans. In the song, Quavo confirms that the rap group Migos was done and there are no plans of reuniting it. “So do not ask about Migos, T is gone, we have gone, young n****s... it cannot back (damn)," he raps in the song. The group was made up of the late Takeoff, Quavo and Offset who are all blood-related. With Takeoff being the centre of focus, Quavo was his uncle while Offset was his cousin. Following Takeoff’s death last November, it was expected that the  Migos would reunite in honour of his demise but that was not forthcoming. Migos fans had expected that Quavo and Offset, the group’s remaining members, would do a tribute song to Takeoff together, but this was not to be. The group was, however, rumoured to have split early last year, and word on the street was that Takeoff and Quavo had formed another group dubbed ‘Unc & Phew,’ and together they released an album titled ‘Only Built for Infinity Links.’ Takeoff was shot dead on November 1, 2022, in Houston at a bowling alley called 810 Billiards & Bowling Houston. Takeoff, whose real name is Kirsnik Khari Ball, was the youngest member of Migos. Further, 'Greatness' is Quavo's second solo tribute to Takeoff after ‘Without you’ which he dropped last month.
