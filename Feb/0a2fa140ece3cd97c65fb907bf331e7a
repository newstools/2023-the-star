Communities living around forests want the government to review its policy to ensure locals are given priority to purchase at least 30 per cent of forest resources harvested. In a petition presented to the National Assembly by Kesses MP Julius Ruto, the group further wants the House to intervene and bring to an end “regular harassment of forest communities.” “Your humble petitioners pray that the National Assembly through the Public Petitions Committee intervenes to secure the rights and welfare of forest communities and forest associations across the country,” the MP said. The petitioners claimed Kenya Forest Service has repeatedly ignored the work and welfare of forest communities and forest associations. The Forest Conservation Management Act, 2016 recognises a forest community as a group of persons who have a traditional association with a forest for the purposes of livelihood, culture or religion. The petitioners said Parliament needs to ensure logging firms develop local infrastructure such as roads and schools, piping of water into villages. Also the development of water catchment areas as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility. The group also wants the access to Government Procurement Opportunities programme founded on the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act 2015 adhered to. Ruto noted that Article 60(1) (e) of the Constitution provides that land in Kenya shall be held, used and managed in a manner that is equitable, efficient, productive and sustainable. He added that Article 69 further obligates the State to ensure sustainable exploitation, utilisation, management and conservation of the environment and natural resources and equitable sharing of accruing benefits.
