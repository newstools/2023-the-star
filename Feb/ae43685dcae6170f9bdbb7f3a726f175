Opposition chief Raila Odinga said the opposition will not allow the Kenya Kwanza government to make Kenya a single-party state. Speaking in Kisumu during the Azimio rally on Saturday, Raila said he will not be forced to move on until the "electoral fraud" is dealt with. Raila said the opposition has chosen to confront what he termed as the curse of electoral theft. "Kenya can not be taken back to the dark days of KANU and if you want to take us to prison, go ahead and open the prison gates," he said. Raila said he was not afraid of any politically instigated arrests and maintained he still does not recognise Ruto as the President. "We don't care what you do or say. We won't be cowed by your moves. The truth is we beat you during the election and we don't recognise you as the president of Kenya," he said. Raila said the Azimio brigade will not shy away from fighting for matters that concern Kenyans. " We were in the liberation war that gave us independence and we will not shy away from a war that matters to Kenyans," he said. " We were also firmly in the second liberation that gave us multi-party democracy that restored our freedom and gave us a new Constitution." Raila said elections in Kenya are beginning to count for nothing.
