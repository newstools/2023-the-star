One suspected armed robber was on Friday night shot dead in Nairobi’s Makadara area. This is after officers on patrol spotted a motorbike parked suspiciously close to the exit of a mall in South B. According to the statement by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the two suspects engaged the officers in a street chase trying to escape from the officers. They began shooting in the air as they made their escape towards Nairobi West. “But the traffic along the busy road slowed them down granting our officers the best advantage in recent days. The duty Corporal in charge leapt out of the vehicle, took out his pistol and ordered the two to stop,” the DCI said. “He shouted at the two suspects who continued shooting in the air as they scared motorists to give them way.” DCI said as they approached Nairobi West, the motorbike hit a pavement leaving the armed thug on the tarmac, as the rider regained stability and disappeared. They said the suspect reached for his trigger prompting the officer to respond, gunning the suspect down. A Jericho pistol loaded with 11 rounds of ammunition was recovered from the suspect. This comes hours after another suspected thug was on Friday night shot dead in a botched robbery in Githurai 44 area. At the time of his death, a pistol was found on him. In a videotape from the apartment’s CCTV, the thug was captured as he leapt with long strides after the man, while ordering him to empty all his pockets as he pointed the firearm at him. After ransacking his pockets, a getaway motorbike arrived and he hopped on it as it sped away, in what appeared to be a well-calculated plan. According to police, unknown to the gang, sleuths based at Kasarani who were on patrol had parked their car adjacent to a dark wall on a bend one kilometre away after doing several circuits.
