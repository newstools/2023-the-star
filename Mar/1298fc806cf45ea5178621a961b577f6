Content creator Chebet Ronoh announced yesterday she is taking a break from social media. This follows a series of tweets calling out different celebrities. "Apologies to anyone I’ve offended. I have received a call that has told me the truth. Let me go on a hiatus and heal. Again, I apologise for my behaviour," she tweeted. She had accused actress Kate Actress and Elsa Majimbo of allegedly copying her content ideas before going after Nikita Kering, Shorn Arwa, and Kamene Goro. Kate Actress responded, “Ronoh we love aunty Debs, we want to be aunty Debs, the rich aunty, you are such an incredible, consistent content creator. I celebrate you, Ronoh. Keep shining." Shorn Arwa said she wasn't going to involve herself in such conversations.
