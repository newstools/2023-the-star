Equity Bank Hawks thumped Eagle Wings 87-33 in a Kenya National Basketball League clash at the United States International University courts. The bankers, who have now scored over 80 points in their last five games, are peaking at the right time ahead of the playoffs. The team's head coach David Maina is well aware of the reason why his charges, who have lost two matches, are free flowing in the past few weeks. “We are working day by day to make improvements in areas that we are not doing well. We are making a lot of rotation as we get ready for the playoffs,” he said. Table-topping Hawks flew away from their opponent from the opening whistle taking a 46-22 halftime advantage and never looked back. Shilalei Shani topped the scoring chart with 18 points and Betty Kakanu managed 11 for the Hawks who now have 38 points from 20 games. The previous day, Equity Bank pegged down Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) hitting them 83-13. Kananu continued her hot shooting streak as she drained game high of 18 points while Rachael Odhiambo added another 15. Lady Bucks kept Storms scoreless with a 16-0 edge in the second stanza and went on to hit them 39-24. They lost 46-31 to Kenyatta University “Oryx”. Cindy Philip and Juliet Omolo each registered 11 points to their name for the Kisumu side who, however, remain rooted to the base with 19 points. In the men’s game, Africa Nazarene University “Wolfpacks” eased their relegation worries with a 60-54 victory over Umoja. ANU had gone down 49-39 to the University of Nairobi “Terrorists” in a game that David Odanga hit 13 points and Colin’s Nyamwaya 11.
