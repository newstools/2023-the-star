Vihiga Queens captain Merceline Wayodi has said the team needs to maintain focus to keep alive their ambitions of successfully defending the Women's Premier League title. Wayodi's sentiments comes in the wake of their 2-0 chastening defeat in the hands of red-hot Gaspo Women at Mumias Sports Complex on Sunday. It was Vihiga's third defeat in 11 matches, a result that demoted the Boniface Nyamunyamu coached side to second position on the log. Wayodi said Vihiga must learn to recover from falling behind during matches. The four-time WPL champions has not had a comeback thus far this season. "Nobody expected us to lose but that is part of the game," Wayodi said. "We have to focus on the next match against Kayole which I believe we need to bounce back in a big way. It is difficult to accept the defeat but we need to stand up, dust ourselves off and move on." The WPL title battleÂ  is a three horse race challenge with leaders Gaspo and Thika Queens determined to dethrone Vihiga from the gong. "Conceding first has been our main undoing this season. Comebacks are hard nowadays. How we react after trailing in matches needs to improve." Despite surrendering top slot to Gaspo, Wayodi said she is happy with the performance of the team. The dynamic midfielder added that new signings are needed to cope up with the congested fixture as well as injuries. "Injuries have left our squad depleted. We lack squad depth and that is why the team needs new players. The second leg will be tough but the ultimate goal is to retain the title."
