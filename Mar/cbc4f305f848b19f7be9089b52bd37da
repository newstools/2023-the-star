Security has been beefed up at State House Road following ODM leader Raila Odinga as the mass action deadline elapses on Wednesday. Police have also laid roadblocks. Last month, Raila gave the government a 14-day mass action ultimatum if Jeevanjee's demands are not met, as the party seeks electoral justice. "We came here as seekers of truth and defenders of justice. We are seekers and defenders of electoral justice, social and economic justice. We pray that this may be firmly planted in the soils of our country," he said. Raila also demanded that President William Ruto's government lowers the price of basic commodities and taxes, in 14 days. He said failure to do so, the Opposition will stage anti-government demonstrations. The opposition coalition is also said to be planning to stage demonstrations in major towns across the country. Raila has been meeting different interest groups drawn from political parties and religious organisations as he seeks to fire up his support base for the planned protests against “electoral fraud”.
