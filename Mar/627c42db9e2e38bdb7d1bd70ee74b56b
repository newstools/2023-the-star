Black Mamba beat Boomerang 34-25 in a Kenya Handball Federation league clash at Nyayo National Stadium. The Kaloleni-based side took an 18-11 half-time advantage and build on that,  going all the way to the delight of their tactician Abdalla Otieno. "We are on the right course. We are gunning for the top position and if we don't get that, we will settle for second," offered Otieno. "Right now, the boys are in very high spirits and we are now targeting ] league leaders Cereals Board whom we will meet next week," he noted. Victor Lwale and Paul Ondara led Mamba's scoring tally with nine goals each while the losers had six from Enock Kipngetich. Boomerang had a rough day as they fought hard before going down 40-34 to Kenyatta University. KU had a close 15-14 lead at the break. In the ladies' cadre,  Ulinzi Sharks drubbed New Hope 61-11 after taking a 31-2 halftime margin to close in on leaders Nairobi Water Queens. Sarah Wasike posted 16 points while Sharon Chelule had six in the win that took the soldiers back to the top three spots on 30 points. This win came after Sharks had posted back-to-back wins over Rising and Net Navigators whom they eclipsed 59-11 and 36-15 respectively. National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) blanked Net Navigators 27-18 as Abigale Kambua nailed six goals to also make 30 points. Unbeaten Water Queens have garnered a total of 34 points from 17 games and so far look well placed to reclaim their crown. In other matches over the weekend, Thika stunned Strathmore University 24-22 as Young City deflated Desert Scorpions 34-32. Boomerang lost all their three-weekend engagements as they were also hit 33-25 by Ulinzi who did well to keep their unbeaten run intact.
