Police in Kabete and Kikuyu Sub Counties on Monday apprehended 3 suspected armed gangsters believed to be terrorising and robbing residents with homemade guns. The police led by Kiambu police commander Perminus Kioi formed a multi-joint operation between Kabete and Kikuyu police divisions following many cases of crime being reported in the area. The residents claimed that the suspects use motorcycles to enable them to escape quickly after robbing victims. Angry residents on Saturday arrested a suspect in Kikuyu town and lynched him. The gang was attacked by residents as they tried to rob a resident. One of the gangsters was overpowered by locals while his two accomplices run for their lives. Speaking to journalists at Kikuyu police station, Kioi said the three suspects were arrested today at Kabete as police investigate residents' tipoff. He said their detectives recovered three motorcycles, four homemade guns that were able to shoot, bhang and several boxes of wines and spirit and other crude weapons used to attack residents at their homes and at their businesses. Kioi warned that the joint operation would continue so as to ensure no criminal activity would relapse in the area. "We are working so hard together with locals. I want to send a clear message to criminals that there is no space left for them not only in Kikuyu and Kabete, but the whole county of Kiambu," he warned. He noted that the suspects will be arraigned in court once investigations are complete. A trader Stephen Kuria applauded the police for moving with speed so as to rescue them from criminals. "We are so close to Nairobi city and the region appears so urban, but these criminals have forced us to be closing our businesses so early at 6 pm and latest at 7 pm so as to avoid being mugged at gunpoint and being robbed," he noted.
