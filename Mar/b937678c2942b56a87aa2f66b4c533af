Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna has issued several safety demands to Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja over the opposition-planned demos on March 20. Sifuna urged Sakaja to focus on preparing the city for visitors who will be taking to the streets due to the high cost of living and other demands as stated by ODM leader Raila Odinga. "We want clean public toilets, drinkable water in the CBD, ambulances and medical facilities on standby, traffic marshalls to guide traffic and protect the visitors etc," he tweeted. The Azimio la Umoja brigade on Sunday toured Mombasa county wooing their supporters ahead of the planned mass action. Raila had announced the commencement of mass action, with street protests on March 20. The Azimio leader and his team launched a new initiative branded Movement for Defence of Democracy, giving a 15-point attack on why Ruto must quit as President. Some of the issues he cited included the high cost of living, over-taxation, GMO importation, ongoing reconstitution of IEBC, electoral deceit, victimisation of four IEBC commissioners, mishandling of Azimio presidential petition by the apex court and state capture of the other arms of government. Others are tribalism, unnecessary expansion of the Executive, religious discrimination, targeted sacking of civil servants and land grabbing amongst others. “The attempt by Kenya Kwanza regime to singlehandedly reconstitute the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission by forming a William Ruto Electoral Commission is a reckless misadventure that is intended to wreck this country,” Raila said. He termed the IEBC selection panel a Ruto puppet that the President intends to use "to have an undue advantage in the 2027 general elections.” “For this reason, Ruto must go!” Raila said. “We begin telling Ruto and Gachagua that we have no more patience with an illegitimate regime that is too mean-spirited and too incompetent to deploy resources for an all-out war on poverty and suffering,” Raila said.
