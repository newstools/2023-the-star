Former Migori governor Okoth Obado has criticized Azimio la Umoja leader Raila Odinga's calls for mass action and Friday rally. The ex-governor also told off Raila for sanctioning legislators from the region who visited the State House and were hosted by President William Ruto and cabinet secretaries. On Friday during a rally in Migori, Raila took a swipe at Uriri MP Mark Nyamita and his Rongo counterpart Paul Abuor calling them traitors for choosing to work with the government. “Raila and other leaders incited the crowd to start demonstrations, we will not put people’s lives on the line for his selfish gain,” Obado said. He said Luo as a community was ready to work closely with President Ruto and already, there are several appointments of locals and development projects aligned for the region. Speaking to the press in Migori town on Saturday morning when he met Kenya Kwanza mobilisers, Obado said the county and Nyanza region will not follow Raila's calls for demonstrations and mass action. “What happened on Friday is that we had political tourists in the county but the county and the region will not join in calls for demonstrations,” Obado said. The former governor said as Kenya Kwanza Nyanza Coordinator he is keen on allowing many elected leaders from the region to seek development from the State House. “We support those elected leaders from Nyanza who have chosen to work with the government, let Raila stop intimidating them because many are willing and still approach us on the sidelines,” Obado said. Geoffrey Ocholla, Kenya Kwanza Suna East coordinator, said there are youths and first-time voters in the last polls who only know of Raila demonstrations in each election cycle. The two said the current economic hardship faced by Kenyans was inherited from the past regime and six months is not enough to reverse the trend.
