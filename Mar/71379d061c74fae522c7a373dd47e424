Kenya Prisons men's team coach David Lung'aho admits that duels against Equity Bank and Trail Blazers this weekend will define their season. The third leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation men's league takes place at Nyayo stadium from Friday to Sunday. The Warders will also settle scores with Rift Valley Prisons on the last day. "The first two days are going to be tough. If we can navigate against Equity and Trail Blazers, then we will put ourselves in a better position. Winning against the two will give us the morale to deal with RVP," Lung'aho said. Lun'aho said the team gleaned valuable lessons from their 3-0 loss against the General Service Unit in the last leg. Prisons cannot afford to drop more points according to Lung'aho. "We lost but I don't think negatively. We intend to continue playing better by taking one match at a time." The former national women's team coach added that they are currently using the Kasarani Indoor Arena for training. "We have been at Kasarani from Wednesday. The boys are in better shape." Lung'aho challenged Dennis Esokon and Emmanuel Mwadori to up their game to become key members of the team.Â  The pair re-joined the team after undergoing mandatory training at Kenya Prisons Staff Training College. "The duo are good, they will only get better with training."
