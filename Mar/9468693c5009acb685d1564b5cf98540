Necklines affect your outfit, especially plus-size curvy women. A slight change whether it is in shape or depth of the neckline affects how the outfit looks on you and the general aesthetic. Below are some necklines plus size women can choose from. Asymmetric necklines Although most plus-size women shy away from this neckline, for fear that it is not flattering, it is one of the best options for plus-size women since it gives an illusion of narrow shoulders and waist. It is also figure-flattering. Cowl necklines It offers a soft and subtle draping effect to the clothing without adding bulk to your shape. It also enhances a feminine aesthetic to your outfit. They draw attention to the face thus creating balance in the body. Off-the-shoulder neckline Opt for this if you are a plus-size woman with a pear of hourglass body shape. It draws attention to the chest area and the shoulders of the body. Ensure it fits your shoulders and chest area. V neckline It works for every body shape. However, if you are a plus-size woman with a big bust, wider neck or broad shoulders, then this is your go-to neckline. It creates an elongation effect on the neck and chest area. It also balances the wider parts by giving them a narrower look. Scoop neckline Just like the V neckline, they provide a slimming effect to the neck and shoulder area. If you are worrying about showing too much skin or cleavage as a plus-size woman, then opt for a scoop neckline.
