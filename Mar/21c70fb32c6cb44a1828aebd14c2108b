Azimio Chief Raila Odinga on Thursday said that civil servants in the country no longer have security for their jobs. Raila was speaking in Nairobi during a meeting with Islamic leaders to discuss the controversial LGBTQ ruling that was recently passed by the Supreme Court to allow the group form NGOs. "Many civil servants are being laid off. Now there is no security of employment," he said. "Someone who has worked for the government for 20 years is being laid off haphazardly despite making no mistake. At that point, there is no company that will employ him and give him a pension. He is sent on his way simply because he worked with the previous regime." He said the move is not fair. The ODM leader claimed some civil servants were dismissed because they are not tribally correct. "People are being fired like dogs in this country. Every day in the newspapers, every week there is a list of newly employed people. Directors, Chairmen of parastatals, CEOs and you will see one tribe here must be in the new appointments. Other tribes are not therein," Raila said. Since President William Ruto took to power last year, he has beenÂ reorganising the government by appointing people he believes will help implement his agenda for the country.
