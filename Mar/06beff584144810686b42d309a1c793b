Interior Cabinet Secretary Kindiki Kithure has said the government shall respect whatever decision the Directorate of Criminal Investigations will make on the case of former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i. Kindiki, while addressing the media on Wednesday, said the government policy will entail absolute respect for the rule of law. He said regard for all constitutional organs and respect for all independent offices of Kenya will be upheld. "While I commend the professionalism of the police in handling Dr Matiang’i’s matter, the government shall respect the decisions arrived at by the DCI," he said. He said the DCI has already completed their investigations on the case and the recommendations submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions "The government will equally respect the decisional independence of the DPP and should any person be prosecuted as a result of these investigations; the government shall respect the outcome and decision of the courts," he told the media. On Tuesday, Matiang'i in the company of his lawyers appeared before DCI offices for grilling over claims of publication of false information. The former CS is being accused of spreading false information about an alleged raid at his Karen residence by a group of police officers. The DCI said the offence is contrary to Section 23 of the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crimes Act of 2018.
