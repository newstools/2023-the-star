Kenyans have been urged to plant a tree in honour of  Wangari Maathai. A tweet by the University of Nairobi said March 3 is Wangari Maathai and African Environment Day. “Time to take action. Plant a tree where you are on March 3 to keep Wangari Maathai legacy going,” the tweet read. In January 2012, the African Union (AU) adopted a decision calling for the joint commemoration of Africa Environment Day and Wangari Maathai Day in recognition of the work and life of the deceased Prof Wangari Maathai. Maathai dedicated her life to promoting environmental conservation and sustainable development in Africa and she was the first African woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement, an environmental Non-Governmental Organisation focused on addressing deforestation and environmental degradation. This is in addition to the greater impact of these factors on the livelihoods of rural women who bore the brunt of the negative environmental impact on agriculture and foods security thereby leading to disenfranchisement. Prof Maathai led the fight to protect water catchment areas advocating for the planting of trees, environmental conservation, and women's rights in Kenya. In 2004, she became the first African woman to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for her contribution to “sustainable development, democracy and peace”. She authored several books including: The Green Belt Movement; Unbowed: A Memoir; The Challenge for Africa; and Replenishing the Earth.
