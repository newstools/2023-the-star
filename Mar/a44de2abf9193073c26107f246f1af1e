Azimio leader Raila Odinga called on Kenyans to be courageous and not relent in the fight to save Kenya from sinking. Raila said his Azimio team is fearless and ready to lead other Kenyans in the fight. "Do not fear these people. Be firm, you will succeed," said Raila. He spoke at the Shalom Miracle Church in Tononoka, Mombasa where he and other Azimio leaders attended a church service led by Bishop Robert Wafula. Raila said the Azimio team is ready to fight for the truth and justice. He said the cost of living has come down. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said Kenya has suffered electoral and other injustices since independence. He likened the country to the kingdom of God, which he said has suffered from spiritual violence from the days of John the Baptist. "For this nation stand firm and see the salvation," he told Kenyans. He likened the Kenya Kwanza regime to the Biblical Egyptian pharaoh, saying it oppresses Kenyans. He however said it will soon end. "The Egyptian you see today, who have been given a red card by the bishop, you will see them no more. "Those Egyptians who are used to stealing elections you will see them no more," said Kalonzo. He asked the clergy in Kenya to pray for the country. Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua said true leaders do not fight for their own interests "That has been the testimony of our brother Raila Odinga," said Karua. He said Kenyans know that there are things to be set right in Kenya. "God's people will be released by the Pharaohs," she said. Karua said there are modern day Pharaohs who are oppressing Kenyans. "If we pray for anything let us believe it will happen," said Karua. Bishop Wafula said unity is a weapon against adversaries. "Walk in unity. Unity is a very strong weapon. Stay together," the Bishop told Kenyans.
