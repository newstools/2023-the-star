Kiss FM presenter Sheila 'Kwambox' Kwamboka has urged DJ Fatxo to stop speaking to the media and put his energy on the DCI. This is after interior designer Jeff Mwathi allegedly fell to his death off a balcony at the DJ's house. "We can only speculate but the DCI have been deployed. The CS said they are leaving no stone upturned. You can tell that Kenyans are really invested in this story," she said. "DJ Fatxo needs to stop talking to the media. People will say whatever they want to say, but what will matter is what DCI finds. Those are the people he should be speaking to." Kwambox said people should be told how to be safe on a balcony.
