Mwala MP Vincent Musau now wants the Parliament to increase funding in the healthcare sector to improve research and awareness. This, he said, will make cancer treatment more affordable to many Kenyans who are battling the pandemic. Musau says the only hope Kenyans are left with to battle Cancer is if Universal Health Coverage (UHC) facilitates the initiative. The lawmaker said cancer is the third leading cause of death in Kenya, with 60% of those affected being aged 70 and below. “In cancer problems, Leukemia ranks third after breast and cervical cancer for women, then prostate cancer for men,” Musau said. “Lack of awareness, inadequate diagnostic facilities, high cost of treatment and poverty contribute to 80% of diagnoses being made at the late stages,” he added. The lawmaker who was speaking to Star was quoting the data from MOH-Kenya. The lawmaker was speaking on Saturday at Annastacia Muendo’s home while consoling her for the loss of her husband Joseph Kyalo who succumbed to leukaemia on February 25. Kyalo’s burial is set for March 10. The MP was in the company of Mwalyo Joshua of Masinga Constituency and former Machakos MP Victor Munyaka. The UDA party leaders from Lower Eastern paid their respects to the late Joseph Kyalo at the Langata home. However, Annastacia Muendo is set to be vetted on Monday at 3pm by the Parliamentary Service Commission for the position of Chief Administrative Secretary. She is hoping to be given the opportunity to lead the people of Kenya as the CAS representing the people of lower eastern. Muendo is currently pursuing a PhD in Business Administration (Finance) at the JKUAT CBD campus. She has an MBA in Finance and a B.Com in Accounting from Kenyatta University, as well as a CPA qualification, which gives her a solid foundation in the field of finance and accounting. Muendo was serving as the director in Makueni County before exiting to contest for Yatta constituency which she lost to Basil Ngui.
