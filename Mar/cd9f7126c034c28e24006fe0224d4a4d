Meteorologists are very clear that Kenya is staring at a sixth season with no rain. Meteorological services director David Gikungu said indications point to a situation where most parts of Kenya will receive depressed rains in the March-May season. This is Kenya's main cropping season but according to the Met services, the rains will begin late, from the first week of April, in most areas. In view of the changing weather conditions in Kenya, farmers must start thinking of planting fast-growing or drought-resistant crops. Globally, just like in Kenya, there is overdependence on maize, rice and wheat, leading to food deficit, yet crops such as bananas, sorghum, millet and cassava require little rain. Officials, among them those from the Ministry of Water, are asking Kenyans to think ahead and prepare to harvest rainwater despite the depressed amounts. However, currently, the price of a good and large enough water tank is beyond the reach of many Kenyans. As of December 2022, the price of a standard cylindrical water tank ranged from Sh20,000 for a 2,000-litre tank to Sh 319,000 for a 24,000-litre tank. Manufacturing costs and taxes have pushed up the price of the tanks, which ideally every homestead should have. The starting point should be removing VAT and other duties from these products to make them easily available for rainwater storage. So much rainwater goes to waste that if tapped could make a big difference. Quote of the Day: “Whatever you tax, you get less of.” Alan Greenspan The American economist was born on March 6, 1926
