Kenya Power has announced power restoration in parts of Kisumu, Nakuru and Eldoret. "We are working to restore normalcy in other areas as soon as possible," Kenya Power said. In a statement, Kenya Power said a fault occurred on Suswa-Loyangalani high-voltage power transmission line. "We thank our customers for their patience as we continue with the restoration exercise," the statement read. The announcement came after a nationwide power outage that occurred due to a system disturbance. In an earlier statement on Saturday evening, Kenya Power said it had lost power supply in various parts of the country due to system disturbance. "We are working to restore normalcy within the shortest time possible," the earlier statement read. The company further stated it will inform the public of the restoration progress. "We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused," they said. Complaints from Kenyans had started streaming in at 6:00 pm, with most residents in Nairobi saying they were currently in the dark.
