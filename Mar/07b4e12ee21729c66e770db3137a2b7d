Thika Queens have confirmed the signing of midfielders Lorna Nyarinda and Anastazia Neema. Nyarinda joins from Kibera Soccer while Neema has been acquired from Boabab Queens of Tanzania. Thika coach Fred Majani has prioritised bolstering his midfield ranks to give the team a competitive advantage in the second leg. "Any player that comes to join us must be proven. We are not just signing but we want players who will slot straight into the starting line-up," Majani said. "Neema is a utility player who can serve us in defence and midfield. I have watched her in training and I am excited to see her play as soon as possible. Nyarinda's quality is obvious. She has the experience to thrive in the league." Neema is unavailable for the Trans Nzoia Falcons clash on Sunday afternoon. "Her card is not ready yet but she will play in the Football Kenya Federation women's Cup round of 32 against Migori next weekend," Majani hinted. Thika are third in the 12-team league with 21 points after 11 matches. The team lost the chance to go top last weekend after losing 1-0 to Zetech Sparks. "We are working on winning the league. All top three teams have a chance and that is our sole objective."
