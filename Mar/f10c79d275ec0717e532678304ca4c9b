There will be no curriculum change from a Competency Based Curriculum, revert to 8-4-4, Education CS Ezekiel Machogu has said. Machogu while appearing before Senate Education Committee said due process was followed before the official rollout of CBC. “As a country, we can not get mixed up and destroy the education sector because that will destroy the country. We have walked this journey for six years,” Machogu said. The CS noted that the implementation of CBC did not begin in 2016 but way earlier “The engagement started in 2011, CBC is actually the best. There is no way we can go back and Kenyans themselves agree that this is the best curriculum just that it has few issues,” he said. Machogu's remarks come amidst a series of demands by politicians and leaders to scrap the curriculum. During a special motion moved by Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma, MPs said there was great anxiety among pupils, parents, teachers and education stakeholders. Lack of capacity in the face of the sorry state of infrastructure and the inadequate number of teachers are among the issues the leaders said are hurting CBC. The leaders raised concerns that some of the teachers handling JSS classes were not specialised in the subjects they are teaching, as well as discrepancies in uniforms. “We have a situation where we are pretending to be implementing a programme but no meaningful learning is happening in the country,” Kaluma said, adding that the old system equipped learners better. He said there was a need for a proper review of the system and proper facilities put in place before the Education ministry goes full throttle with the new curriculum. Kaluma, hailing the old system, said CBC does not give learners adequate hands-on experience as compared to 8-4-4.
