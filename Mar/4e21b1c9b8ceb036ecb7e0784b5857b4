Naftali Kinuthia who hacked medical student Ivy Wangeci to death has said he did so driven by anger. Kinuthia said he was focused on making their lives better and did not plan to kill Wangechi prior to the incident. "I would like to say that I did not have such an intention. If there was, maybe it would happen earlier because I had visited her and we were good," he said. He spoke when he appeared before Justice Githinji to give his final defence evidence in the murder case on Friday. Kinuthia added that he never stopped taking care of Wangechi as he wanted to make their lives better. "My mind was occupied with making things better and better every day for us," he said. On April 9, 2019, Kinuthia attacked Wangechi with an axe, killing her, outside the Moi Referral Hospital in Eldoret. He had travelled from Nairobi to wish Wangechi, who had blocked her sometime earlier, a happy birthday but she told him she had a new boyfriend. He said he walked back to his car and decided never to talk to her again but as he was getting into the car, he saw Wangechi hugging another man. "At that point, I lost control and was too angry because of what was happening before me.Â  I wasn't myself again and can't tell how I decided to pick the axe and attack her," he said. Kinuthia said the axe had been in the car for a year for security purposes as he mostly worked at night. The judge directed the case to be mentioned on April 25th for final submissions before the judgement.
