President William Ruto on Thursday announced that the government will triple the funds allocated to Women Enterprise Fund. "I’m announcing today that we are going to triple the resources available under that fund from Sh4 billion to Sh13.5 billion, " he said. Ruto noted that the amount of Sh4.5 billion has been stagnant for the past 15 years. He explained that increasing the amount, will also increase the capacity of women to access the funds.  “By tripling the resources available under that fund, we can also triple the number of women groups that will benefit from this fund because this is the most reliable fund. President Ruto noted that the Woman Enterprise Fund has a  99 percent success rate, therefore, women deserve what the government is going to do by increasing the amount.
