Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has publicly declared that Lang'ata MP Phelix Odiwuor alias Jalang'o belongs to the UDA camp. Speaking during the groundbreaking of the Starehe Affordable Housing project, Gachagua recounted how Jalang'o was chased during the Azimio Parliamentary Group (PG) meeting. "Huyu Jalang'o ni wetu, baada ya kukutana na rais wetu William Ruto kule State House kwa mambo maendeleo, alifukuzwa kwa mkutano," he said. (Jalang'o is now in our camp because after meeting President William Ruto at State House on matters of development, he was chased from the Azimo meeting.) Gachagua also urged Daragoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi to join the Kenya Kwanza camp as it only focuses on development. "I am so happy to see Beatrice Elachi, we want you with us, if I see you at the demonstrations I will be sad, we know you don't know how to throw stones," he said. Last month, Jalang'o said Azimio leader Raila Odinga's security told him to walk out shortly after the ODM leader arrived for the meeting held Â in Machakos "I came here because I am a member of ODM and Azimio. When we walked in there was a group of boys who blocked me and said that I will not go in," he said then. "When Baba walked in one of his security told me to walk out and I walked out." ODM party members have since said that the meeting held at State House was for personal gain. The party director of communications Philip Etale termed the State House meetings as a tactic to divert the nation's attention from the high cost of living, unbearable school fees for their children and corruption. "The party has been monitoring closely the behind-the-scenes activities involving some of them and today was just the climax," he said.
