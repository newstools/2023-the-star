National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula has asked Kenyans to keep off the protests called by Azimio leader Raila Odinga. According to Wetang'ula, the protest will not help put food on their tables. He said there is a legitimate government in place and Kenyans should instead focus on the Kenya Kwanza development plan that is set to eventually help ease the high cost of living. "Elections ended a long time ago and there is no time to waste other than serving the people," Wetang'ula said. He spoke on Saturday when he presided over a funds drive event at Kiboswa SDA church in Chesumei constituency, Nandi county. The Speaker went on to say that Raila and his people were only out to obstruct the government from developing the economy of the country, with their unconstructive rallies. He also called on the worshipers to pray for the country from the confusion Raila is trying to create. "I want to tell our President William Ruto to concentrate on serving the people of Kenya and ensure that taxes collected are put to the right use, work towards bringing down the cost of fuel, and create employment opportunities among other pressing issues in our country," the speaker said. "Kenya has already moved on to build her economy and the Kenya Kwanza government will not allow room for mass action in the country." Wetang'ula’s sentiments were echoed by other leaders including Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen who pointed out that it was still too early for Azimio to move to the streets. The two leaders were accompanied by Governor Nandi County, Stephen Sang, Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen Senator Samson Cherarigei, MPs Paul Biego (Chesumei), Abraham Kirwa (Mosop), Murumba Chikati (Tongaren) and Julius Kibiwot (Tinderet). Nandi and Uasin Gishu county speakers Philemon Melly and Philip Muigei and a host of MCAs were also present.
