Nairobi Prisons coach Salome Wanjala says winning the African Club Volleyball Championship with Kenya Prisons in 2013 remains the best moment in her illustrious playing career. Wanjala said losing 3-2 in the pool against Algeria's GS Petroliers and beating the same opposition by the same scoreline in the final was the craziest feeling in her decade long career. Wanjala won four continental titles with Prisons in 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012 in her seven-year spell. She said: "I have won a lot in my career but the 2013 title tops all my achievements because of the circumstance we achieved the victory." " We lost the first set in the final  but we overturned the tables when the final whistle was sounded. I sunk on my knees and cried tears of joy. The competition was stiff but mentality was the difference," the former setter revealed. Wanjala also enjoyed a six-year spell with Malkia Strikers. She won the 2005 Africa Cup of Nations trophy with the national team and played several qualifiers for the World Championships and also World Cup. Salome joined Kcb in 2017 but opted to retire in 2019. She continued: "My last match in a KCB jersey in 2019 comes second. We played Kenya Pipeline in the playoffs and the pressure was immense." "We again came from behind to win the tie 3-2. I was on the bench but the players demanded me to be introduced. I ended up changing the game in our favour. I am proud my career ended on a high." Upon her retirement in 2019, the Mukumu girls alumna had already  done her FIVB level one and two coaching badges, making it easier for her to claim the Nairobi Prisons coaching role. "I want now to mentor other players and see them flourish in their careers," she presumed. Wanjala doubles up as the national women's beach volleyball coach.
