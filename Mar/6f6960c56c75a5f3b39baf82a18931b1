Work on the Sh890 million 13km Koru Junction-Bible School road has started. Kisumu Senator Tom Ojienda said in the first year Sh330 million would be released for the road. Some Sh30 million has already been released for the works. He said in the coming weeks they will ask Roads CS Kipchumba Murkomen to visit the site and see the progress. “What we are looking for is politics that brings development and results to improve people's lives and open up the society,” Ojienda said during the commissioning of the project in Koru. The senator said there is goodwill from the government's side and they will ensure the road is completed within 24 months. “The contractor is already on site and we will ensure that all the money is released to aid in completion of this project that will immensely benefit the people of Muhoroni constituency,” Ojienda said. “The road will facilitate the opening up of centres and improve the economy of Kisumu.” Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo said, “We appreciate the government and Senator Ojienda for helping in lobbying for the funds.” He said residents pay taxes and deserve such projects. Contractor Wycliffe Odoyo said they have been at the site for close to a week now. He said the project was supposed to begin before the August election, but the government was yet to release the 10 per cent downpayment of the total allocation. “We appreciate the coming of the senator and area MP to help us get the funds for this project,” Odoyo said.
