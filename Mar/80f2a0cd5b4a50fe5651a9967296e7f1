Sports CS Ababu Namwamba has announced that the  WRC Safari Rally 2023 will be open for all Kenyans. He said the event, set for June 22 to 25, in Naivasha County, will have a "strong hustler feel." It will mark 70 years of the Safari Rally in Kenya. "In the Bottom Up spirit, we are opening up these rallies so that Kenyans of all walks of life can have a piece," he said on Thursday. Namwamba was on an inspection tour of Uhuru Park Gardens, to check on the progress of the venue earmarked for the flag-off of the rally. The CS said there will be an infusion of arts, music, and fashion in a designated village dubbed the 'Hustler Bazaar', at the starting points at Uhuru and Central parks. There will also be a bazaar at Kendong viewing point among other places, yet to be announced. "We are providing spaces for you to get a piece of the pie that the WRC Safari Rally is. So we are telling Kenyans to please get ready in three months, we want you to be part of this fun," the CS said. "Artists, if you are musicians, a painter, a comedian or you do visual art, we are going to provide a space for you to be part of the sherehe celebrating the Kenyan heritage." Namwamba further said the ministry was setting up special points for screening the rally so Kenyans across the country can be accommodated. "Working with governors we hope to set up special screening points where you can be able to be part of that whole experience," he added. The CS said they will also set up bazaars at the screening points to boost businesses. "It is all part of our Talanta Hela initiative where we want to use sports and arts to put money in the pockets of our people," Namwamba said. He was accompanied by WRC Safari Rally LOC chairpersonÂ Carl 'Flash' Tundo and CEO Phineas Kimathi, among others.
