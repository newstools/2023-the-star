National under-21 men's hockey team must be efficient in attack  to stand a chance of beating South Africa on Wednesday in the Junior Africa Cup in Ismailia, Egypt. Kenya beat Zimbabwe 3-1 on Monday  courtesy of goals from assistant captain Mathias Golarire, Mathew Momanyi and  Job Wandera to revive their hopes of qualifying for the Junior World Cup. Kenya on Sunday lost 1-0 to Egypt. Coach Mike Malungu wants his charges to be also strong defensively in order to deal with their tough to beat opponents. "We just have to convert our chances and play boldly against South Africa. The win on Monday gave us a lifeline therefore we need to build on what we did against Zimbabwe," Malungu said. "We have to be watertight in defence. Against Egypt, we did not make use of our chances. Had we been efficient in the D,  the minimum would have been a draw for us. " South Africa top the four-team competition with maximum six points from two matches. Kenya, Egypt and Zimbabwe are second, third and fourth respectively according to Malungu. "We have more than 50 percent chance of qualifying now that the top two teams are guaranteed slots. We have a positive goal difference, making our tie with South Africa a do-or-die match. It will boil down to goal difference if we beat South Africa."
