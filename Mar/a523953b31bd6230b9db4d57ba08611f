Lakers team manager John Paul Otieno believes the club needs to have a junior team in the next five years. Lakers, located in Kisumu, is a women's hockey team that plies trade in the Kenya Hockey Union Women's Premier League. He said the management of the club is burning their midnight oil to have another team play in the Super League "In five years' time, we want to have a development side that will be the feeder to the senior team. We also intend to have another younger team in the Super League that will be managed by the senior players," Otieno said. Just like many self-supporting teams, the Lakers are in financial turmoil. The team even struggled to meet the facilitation fee for the African Cup for Club Championship last month. Accommodation and other logistics were a nightmare too. With players in different locations, transport expenses to the training base at Kisumu Day is burdensome. That is the reason the team only trains thrice a week (Friday-Sunday). "Basically,Â  Field Hockey equipment is expensive. We also have a few grounds within Kisumu but all are substandard. The Kisumu Sports Ground which was our home ground was closed for renovation. The Simba Club pitch is private; money is needed for hiring leaving us with the option of only Kisumu Day that is serving us now," Otieno said. The Lakers finished third last season. They placed fourth in the seven-team ACCC championship. "The management hosts the players after training. Some are offered accommodation by other players because they understand we don't have a source of revenue," Otieno said.
