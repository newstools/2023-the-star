Azimio leader Raila Odinga and other leaders will on Saturday lead a rally in Narok. The leaders are expected to tour Ewaso Nyiro Market, Ntulele Market among other regions in Narok. On Friday, Raila lead the Azimio coalition rally in Migori county where he said he will soon unveil a list of products to be boycotted. The ODM boss said a number of companies are being misused by President William Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza administration and must be shunned by opposition supporters. “There are many companies being misused and next week we will unveil a list of products to be boycotted,” Raila said. The opposition demos are slowly picking up as a number of counties took to the streets to protest the high cost of living. This was after Raila declared the start of mass action against the Kenya Kwanza regime which he termed illegitimate. Raila said they have invoked the provisions of the Constitution to launch a massive peaceful movement of defiance against an illegal government. "Take note that on the 20th of March 2023, we have a date with destiny in Nairobi. On that day our supporters throughout the country shall stage a massive procession in Nairobi for a legitimate and inclusive government. Save the date," Raila said. "We begin telling Ruto and [DP Rigathi] Gachagua that we can’t keep living on false promises. We begin telling Ruto and Gachagua our clear understanding that when we keep taking painkillers long enough, they will cease killing the pain; and that is when the real pain will begin," he added.
