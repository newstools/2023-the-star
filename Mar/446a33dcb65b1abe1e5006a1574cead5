For the umpteenth time, a high-end car will be at stake for this week's Magical Kenya Open Hole-in-One. Speaking at Muthaiga Golf Club, Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) sponsorship director Zuhura Odhiambo confirmed that a BMW X5 will be part of the tournament competition for hole-in-one at the traditional 13th hole. While handing over the car to the organisers, Inchcape Kenya marketing and customer experience manager Anne Wanyeki said they are proud to be associated with Kenya's premier golfing event. The hole-in-one on Hole 13 of the Par 71 course has traditionally spiced up the event which is part of the DP World Tour. Several different cars including D.T. Dobie’s Mercedes and Land Rover have always been on offer during the Open 13th hole. Finland’s Oliver Lindell broke the duck in 2017 when he fired a 7-iron into the hole at 173m (191 yards) par three 13th which is the officially designated Hole-In-One during the Kenya Open. This saw him clinch the Hole-in-One car, then a Ford Ranger WildTrak valued at Sh6.9 million. Prior to Oliver Lindell's hole-in-one in 2017, no player had achieved the feat ever since the Hole-in-One car was introduced in the early 1970s.
