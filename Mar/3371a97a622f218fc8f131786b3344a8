Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has disclosed that President William Ruto funded the office of deputy president with his personal finances for four years. Speaking on Sunday, the DP said retired President Uhuru Kenyatta's staff had at the time cut funding to the DP's office which Ruto occupied. Gachagua was responding to reports that he requested Sh1.5 billion from Treasury after they were elected into office. He further stated that former Treasury CS Ukur Yatani and former State House Comptroller Kinuthia Mbugua were trying to clean the damage they had done to the office. "Rigathi Gachagua has never requested for money to his office. Ukur Yatani former CS and Kinuthia Mbugua cut all funds to Rutoâ€™s office. For four years he fuelled GK cars, paid electricity bills, and allowances to staff accompanying him," he said. "When he went into office these two officers sought to undo the damage. That is what they were trying to reinstate. A certain media house was helping Yatani in diverting the attention of Kenyans from real issues," Gachagua added.
