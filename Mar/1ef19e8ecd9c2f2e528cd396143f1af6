Kenya Seven skipper Nelson Oyoo believes the next two tournaments in Hong Kong and Singapore are critical to the team's survival in the World Seven series. Shujaa are currently ranked 13th in the log with 29 points and face a fight to keep their status for next season after an underwhelming campaign. Shujaa are yet to qualify for the Main Cup quarterfinals after six rounds. “ We are in a tight spot at the moment and heading to the next two legs,  we need to pick up maximum points to ensure we play in the World Seven Series next season," added Oyoo. He added that the boys are up for the fight and will battle to the end to ensure they are out of the relegation zone. “The mood in the team is good. The boys have a never-say-die attitude and will keep at it for the remaining four tournaments of the series. Shujaa flirted with relegation in the  2018 -2019  season, finishing 13th and surviving in the final tournament in Paris, where they bagged 10 points to keep their status intact—something not lost on Oyoo. “I remember what happened in Paris four years ago and we don't want to go that route. We want to ensure that by the final two legs, we are safe,” he noted. Shujaa will face Ireland, New Zealand and Commonwealth Games champions South Africa in Hong Kong at the end of the month. Shujaa had an inconsistent campaign in both Los Angeles and Vancouver where they picked eight points. Damian MCGrath's charges beat Australia 12-7, lost to Fiji 19-5 then a shock 7-5 loss to Japan condemned them to the classification matches. Kenya then lost 12-5 to Canada to drop further down the pecking order where they lost to the USA 26-21 to bag solitary point. In Vancouver, Kenya lost their opener 31-12 to Fiji, 26-12 to Great Britain and a shock 21-19 defeat to minnows Uruguay to finish winless in the pool stages. The team bounced back in subsequent matches, stunning African rivals South Africa 17-12, edging Spain 24-14 before losing to Samoa 35-17.
