A man from Chepilat village, in Tiaty East Sub County within Baringo County, has been found guilty of possessing an illegal AK-47 rifle with 28 rounds of ammunition. The suspect, Lutubet Eriondo, was on Thursday convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. The prosecution which was led by Rebecca and Kabarnet Senior Resident Magistrate Edwin Mulochi proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Eriondo was in illegal possession of the firearm. This comes after an underway security operation in the North Rift region to contain the increased cases of banditry attacks. The National Police Service had urged residents in the area to surrender illegal firearms. On Wednesday, interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki revealed that 136 rounds of ammunition were voluntarily returned to the Rift Valley. "Forty-three guns have also been surrendered to security authorities since the beginning of the security operations in parts of Rift Valley," said Kindiki. Also surrounded are two fragmented rifle grenades and three rocket-propelled grenades. The security operation against cattle rustling and banditry in the North Rift started on February 17, following the lapse of a three-day amnesty period for the return of illegally possessed guns. The exercise is being conducted by a multi-agency team led by the Kenya Police and assisted by the Kenya Defence Forces. CS Kindiki said marauding bandits and livestock rustling terrorists have brutally murdered over 100 civilians and 16 police officers in the Northern Rift Valley region. As a result, the CS imposed a 30-day dusk-to-dawn curfew in some banditry-hit areas to set the pace for the operation. The CS gazetted areas in six counties, including Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu, that would observe the curfew.
