Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok has weighed in on Azimio leader Raila Odinga's planned mass actions. In a video seen by the Star, Barchok said the current President William Ruto-led administration has only been in office for a short time and should be given time to deliver. "This government that we have, has been in office for almost six months, and we would like to give President Ruto and his government a chance to plan work that will reach the people in the right way," he said. The governor added that it will take time to right the wrongs, in the same way, things did not go wrong overnight. "Some of the messes that we have within the system will take us time to correct." Barchok said things started going wrong when Raila joined the government in form of a handshake instead of being the watchdog on the opposition side. "I would like to tell Raila, some of these things we are experiencing, as Kenyans, he contributed. When he joined the Kenyatta government through what we are describing as a handshake, that's when things started to go wrong. "Because the opposition should always play its role in ensuring that the government is responsible in matters to do with the wellness of citizens," he said.
