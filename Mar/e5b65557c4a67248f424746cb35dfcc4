Former Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has pledged his support for President William Ruto extending the same to his Bus party members and supporters. Kiraitu who was speaking during a church service at Chuka in Tharaka Nithi told Ruto to count on him as he strives to deliver on his pre-election promises to Kenyans. President William Ruto, and his deputy Rigathi Gachagua among other leaders attended the service. “Those who remember those days, there was somebody called Paul Ng’ei who said kuteleza sio kuanguka, kwa hivyo kiraitu alinanguka lakini sijaanguka na huyu president ni rafiki yangu tumefanya kazi mingi sana na yeye hapo mbeleni,” he said. (...Slipping is not falling, I slipped but I didn't fall and the president is my friend, we have worked together before) He said, “I am 100 per cent behind President Ruto. Being the driver of the Bus party we have asked all our members to join Kenya Kwanza, so President you can count on us.” The party leader also vowed to support Governor Kawira Mwangaza to deliver on her pledges saying he has accepted defeat. Kairaitu was defeated in his bid to recapture the seat in the August 2022 general election by Mwangaza who contested on an independent ticket. The former county boss also supported Azimio's Raila Odinga for the presidential seat. “Mimi nilishindwa na bishop, can you compete with a woman of God? So mimi nilikubali hiyo maneno and bishop you are governor, tutatembea pamoja,” he added. (I was defeated by a bishop...and, I accepted so bishop you are my governor). Kiraitu at the same took a jibe at opposition leader Raila Odinga for leading demonstrations. He said calls to have a reduction in fuel costs and other demands can never be achieved through such mass actions.
