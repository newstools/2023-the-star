Kenyans on Tuesday turned up for eye screening to create awareness on how to avoid blindness from glaucoma. Hundreds of Kenyans turned up to get an eye check-up. They did a procession around Kenyatta National Hospital for awareness creation during the marking of World Glaucoma day. Glaucoma is an eye disease that causes progressive and irreversible loss of eyesight. Health experts have warned that even though everyone is at risk of getting glaucoma, some people are at higher risk of getting the disease. Some of the symptoms of glaucoma include blurred or distorted vision, frequent change of reading glasses and headache.
