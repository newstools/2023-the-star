International Justice Mission Department of Survivors Services official Pamella Masakhwi has described the rampant disappearing of files in the judicial system as part of an impediment to attaining justice for victims. Masakhwi said it causes victims to get tired of pursuing their cases to the end. "Rampant disappearing of files, this causes fatigue for the survivors in pursuing their cases until there is completion," she said. Masakhwi was speaking on Tuesday in Nairobi during the launch of a booklet on mental health and psychosocial support for victims and witnesses in the criminal justice system. She said interference, where evidence is destroyed or manipulated, is another hindrance to the attainment of justice. "Usually, the victim or family members are not able to follow up with their cases in the Criminal Justice System without the support from civil society and this creates a sense of hopelessness for the survivor," she said. She further noted that a complex legal system with limited access to information is another obstacle. Masakhwi explained that survivors do not understand their role in the legal process and the specific mandate of each player rendering them helpless while at the same time, the experience is re-victimising for them. She also noted that delayed witness protection results in the refusal of victims and witnesses to pursue their cases to completion. "This is due to safety fears and lack of trust in the CJS's safety mechanisms, especially in police accountability cases," she said. Masakhiwi said that societal views on sexual abuse exacerbate stigma where both the community and justice actors fail to understand the experience of the victim and may look down on them for seeking justice.
