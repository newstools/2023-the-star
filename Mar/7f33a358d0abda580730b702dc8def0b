Jubilee Secretary General Jeremiah Kioni has claimed that President William Ruto is determined to wedge hostility between the Kikuyu and the Luo communities.  Kioni, who spoke during the burial of the Luo Council of elders chairman Willis Otondi, claimed that Kenyans are now looking upon opposition leader Raila Odinga to unite the country. “I want to say that William Ruto's biggest agenda is to ensure that there is a wedge between the Kikuyu and the Luo communities,” Kioni said. The Jubilee honcho asked the Luo Community to stand firmly behind Raila because already Ruto's Kenya Kwanza government is wobbling. “Those who are in Kenya Kwanza are running away...those who voted for them and those who voted against them are now looking at you Baba (Raila),” he said. Kioni also hailed the late Otondi for his efforts to bridge the historical gaps that existed between the Kikuyu and the Luo community. “Even when he was sick he travelled far and wide to demystify the gap between the Luo and the Kikuyu community,” he said.
