Dorcas Jepchirchir Tuitoek will be seeking another title in the Roma Ostia Half Marathon set for this Sunday in Rome, Italy. Tuitoek has a personal best of 66:33, which she set at the 2019 Istanbul Half Marathon while finishing second. The Atlanta Half Marathon champion is confident of a  podium finish as she seeks to lower her time in the Italian city. “I am looking beyond this event because I want to use it as a springboard to one of the marathon major races later this year,” she said. Tuitoek, who also won the Atlanta Half Marathon in 68:22, is optimistic of lowering her time as she prepares to venture into the full marathon," he added. She said she is currently undergoing intensive training under Gianni Demadonna in Kapsabet and hopes to head to Rome with much fitness. This will be her first race of the year on the road after competing in cross-country meetings across the country. "I competed at the national cross country championships in Ruiru and I finished in position 12, which was good for me," she said. In Rome, Tuitoek will be up against home girl Giovanna Epis among other top athletes. The men's field will feature Kenya's Wesley Kibichii who has a personal best of 59:57 and Isaac Kemboi (60:11) among others. However, the line-up includes top runners like Ethiopian Mogos Tuemay (60:11) and Italian citizen Danielle D’Onofrio (62:32).
