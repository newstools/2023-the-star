Boda Boda operators and supporters of former Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i on Tuesday morning caused a traffic snarl-up along the Kiambu road leading to DCI Headquarters. A moment of standstill was experienced as a convoy of cars led to the DCI HQs offices. Matiang'i was also accompanied by batteries of lawyers, who shielded him as they were addressing the media. Former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i is currently at the DCI headquarters for grilling. Matiang'i is expected to be grilled over alleged claims of publication of false information. Matiangâ€™i is accused of spreading false information about an alleged invasion of a raid in his Karen residence by a group of police officers between February 8 and 9, 2023. His appearance follows a summons by the DCI on Monday. The former CS is accompanied by a host of politicians including his former colleague Eugene Wamalwa.
