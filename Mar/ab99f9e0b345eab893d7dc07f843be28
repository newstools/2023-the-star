First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto has said her team will be going across the country for prayers. Rachel said the mission dubbed Faith Diplomacy, will ensure every corner of the country experiences the prayers. "Sisi ni watu ambao tunapenda maombi, tulipata serekali kupitia maombi, na hatuwezi sema kuwa hatutaomba baada ya yale yalitendeka," she said. (We as a people love prayers, we won the elections through prayers. We continue praying as God is the one who gave us the victory) Mama Rachel urged the congregants to focus on matters of family, as the LGRBTQ debate is threatening the family structure. "We want to strengthen the family institution where we have a father, a mother and children. LGBTQ is forbidden even in the Bible and the African culture. Let us hold on to family values," she said. "Family has become an institution that has been very much attacked. If the mother and father are not peacefully together, then the children will have problems." On February 14, together with President William Ruto and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, Mama Rachel held prayers at the Nyayo Stadium to pray for rain. In November 202, Mama Rachel held a morning devotion with State House staff, saying prayers will be held regularly. In a statement, the first lady said at the house on the hill they always start every week with a devotion. "The beauty about dawn is, no matter how dark our dusks, we are often sure about having a chance to see the light again. And, that is God's intentional act of creation," she tweeted. "That, no matter what challenges we're going through, there's always a chance at redemption. Mornings are for Hope."
