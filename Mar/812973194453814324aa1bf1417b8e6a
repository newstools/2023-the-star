It was an all-women affair as leaders assembled at KICC to commemorate Womenâ€™s Day. The day which is normally marked on March 8, 2023, offers an opportunity to reflect on progress made, call for change and celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities. President William Ruto was not left behind as he switched Aide-De-Camp (ADC) to also celebrate the event. Lieutenant Colonel Damaris Agnetta from the Kenya Army accompanied President Ruto at KICC where he was attending the Women's day event. Lt. Col. Agnetta was commissioned in 2003 and has been serving as an Artillery officer. She's also served in the UN Observer Mission. An ADC is a highly trained military officer who shadows the Commander in Chief during official functions. Only one ADC is appointed at any particular time and they must be in the rank of a Lt Colonel or full Colonel.
