Africa Nazarene University coach Mike Oluoch believes their wins on Sunday will be crucial in their push for Kenya National Basketball League playoffs. The Wolfpacks (men) beat Umoja 60-54 while the Panthers won 41-29 over Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat). “It was a very busy weekend for us and we thank God for the wins, the losses and the lessons we learned,” said Oluoch. “The good thing is that we learned from the mistakes that we made yesterday (on Saturday against the Terrorists).” “It was a close game (against Umoja) and a very aggressive one but our defence helped us prevail. The players listened to instructions which really helped us grab the win,” added Oluoch. Justine Opiyo led the ANU scoring tally with 14 points while Audrey Machiwa tossed in 12. Gilbert Obiero hit 17 for the losers. ANU ladies trailed 5-6 before registering 11-10 and 21-10 and a low-scoring 4-3 in the last three quarters. Nicole Adhiambo showed the way with 14 points. “The ladies game against JKUAT was close in the first half but we managed to break off in the second on our way to victory,” said Oluoch. Zetech University Titans put their best foot forward as they downed University of Nairobi ‘Terrorists’ 52-36 their third win in 21 games. Rodney Sande scored 13 points and Dominic Msangoi 10 for Zetech, who exploded for a 21-6 difference in the last quarter. “It is a great feeling for the players. We played good defence throughout the game,” said Titans’ coach Job Munene. UoN coach Eugene Genga said: “We over-celebrated Saturday’s win over ANU and paid the price. It is unlikely we will make the playoffs.” “We just needed to beat Zetech and be assured of playoffs. But kudos to Zetech, they played well.” The campus lads had on Saturday dampened ANU’s hopes when they defeated them 49-39 in a hard-fought encounter.
