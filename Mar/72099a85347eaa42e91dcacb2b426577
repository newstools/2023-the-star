Arsenal restored their five-point advantage at the top of the Premier League in outstanding fashion with a ruthless victory at Fulham. Mikel Arteta’s side responded to Manchester City’s narrow victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday night by wrapping up this win by half-time as they opened up a 3-0 lead with a devastating attacking display. Gabriel Martinelli had already had a goal narrowly ruled out for offside by VAR, before defender Gabriel headed in Leandro Trossard’s corner after 21 minutes, the first of a trio of assists for the Belgian. Trossard then crossed for Martinelli to beat the static Antonee Robinson to head home at the far post five minutes later, before providing the delivery for captain Martin Odegaard to snuff out any hope of a Fulham recovery with a cool finish of the highest class in first-half stoppage time. Fulham mounted a belated threat after the break as Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale denied Bobby De Cordova-Reid, while Tosin Adarabioyo headed against the woodwork. Arsenal, however, were always in control and Arteta was able to re-introduce influential striker Gabriel Jesus for the first time since he required knee surgery after being injured playing for Brazil against Cameroon at the World Cup for a 13-minute cameo. Meanwhile, Bottom club Southampton earned an important Premier League point by holding 10-man Manchester United to a goalless draw at Old Trafford. Casemiro was sent off after VAR intervention for a dangerous challenge on Carlos Alcaraz in the first half. Both sides had chances - Southampton’s Kyle Walker-Peters and United’s Bruno Fernandes hit the post, and James Ward-Prowse clipped the bar for Saints. Southampton remain two points from safety, while United sit third.
