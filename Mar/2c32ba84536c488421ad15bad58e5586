Africa Nazarene University coach Mike Oluoch said he is working hard to change the team's fortunes in the coming games. The "Wolfpacks" who had a good first leg, have found themselves at the base of the 12-team table with 23 points with six games left to play. The tactician revealed that they are working hard to turn things around and he believes with hard work, determination and discipline, his players will get positive results. "It is my prayer and I believe if we play our part well,Â  we will finish this season in a good position," said Oluoch. He noted that things are really looking bad as the boys have been struggling to win games because of their mindset and lack of winning mentality. The varsity side had a storming first leg and they are the only team to inflict defeat on Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). They also lost by a point to Ulinzi Warriors. ANU still have matches against the University of Nairobi, Umoja, Kenyatta University, Eldonets Platinum, Kenya Ports Authority and Strathmore University. "We are re-grouping and changing strategy and I believe this will help us get back our footing," he offered. He went on: " It's one game at a time for us. Right now is not about playoffs or being top or middle, it's all about restructuring the team and getting a winning mindset and formula." "The Wolfpack, who have no engagement this weekend, are set to battle UoN Terrorists (24 points), Zetech University Titans (25) and Lakeside (25) to avoid the big drop. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) competitions' secretary Joseph Amoko confirmed that two teams from the five categories will be relegated at the end of the season.
