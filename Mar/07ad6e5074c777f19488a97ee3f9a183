Fast-rising KCB setter Emmaculate Nekesa credits her successful career at the club so far to Ernestine Akimanizanye. Akimanizanye was a Rwandeese import who played for the Ruaraka side until 2021 before she returned to Rwanda. She was the first choice setter when Nekesa joined KCB in 2020 from Kwanthanze secondary school. Nekesa 20, said she learnt leadership skills on and off the field from the soft-spoken player. She added that hard work and sacrifice became part of her routine in training. "Akimanizanye was crucial in my development. I was very raw when I came from high school. She challenged me to push myself harder in training by taking every session as an opportunity to become better," Nekesa said. "It was rare for her (Akimanizanye) to be subbed during matches because her game was error-free. She always advised me to minimise the mistakes in my game, talk and motivate the team even when things were tough. For her, communication was everything." Nekesa has gone on to become indispensable in her position. She was the hero as she scored the winning point against Al Ahly in the African Club Championship last year in Tunisia on her international debut. The bankers beat the North Africans 3-1 in the final. The Bungoma County native has gone on to establish herself as a key cog in the national women's team, Malkia Strikers. She was part of the Malkia squad that had a two-month training camp in Brazil 2022 before heading to the World Championships that were co-hosted by the Netherlands and Poland. "I want to maintain my form in order to earn more Malkia call-ups," Nekesa hinted.
