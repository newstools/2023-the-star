Former Nyanza Secondary Schools boys’ basketball champions Agoro Sare have vowed to reclaim their title which they lost last year to Onjiko School. Agoro Sare, coached by Paul Odock and Benson Ochieng, have so far won two pre-season tournaments—Agoro Sare Open and Maseno School’s Amadi Open. On Wednesday, Odock said it’s possible to regain their title. “Last year, we lost our title because we had just come from the Covid-19 pandemic break and we didn’t have enough time to prepare,” said Odock. He added: “We just lost a player from last year’s team and some youngsters have already filled the gap. We expect stiff competition from defending champions Onjiko but we can’t write off other 0schools.” He added that the two tournaments have helped him identify weaknesses in his team which he will address before they host the sub-county games next weekend. “The boys are ready to reclaim their title. The competition this year will be stiff because teams have had enough time to prepare,” said the coach. At the same time, the Nyanza regional Term One games will be held at Kisii School and Kisii University on April 5-8, according to regional quality assurance and standards officer, Ebbie Kegode. She announced that the regional swimming gala will be held at Aga Khan Primary in Kisumu on March 31. In a circular issued for the regional director Nelson Sifuna, she directed that all counties hold their championships by March 19 while sub-counties have until March 5 to conclude their events. Term One games include rugby 15’s, cross country, basketball, hockey, handball, and athletics.
