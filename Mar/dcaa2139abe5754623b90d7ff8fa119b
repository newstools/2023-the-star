Kenya Airways (KQ) has moved to curb human trafficking and modern slavery by launching the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Policy and Public Awareness Campaign. This was in collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The fully endorsed Trafficking in Persons Policy which came into effect in January 2023, outlines the airline's stand and actions against Human Trafficking. The campaign is designed to educate Kenya Airways staff and the public about the misconceptions, the realities of human trafficking and how to identify and report cases of Human Trafficking. KQ Chief Financial Officer, Hellen Mwariri Mathuka said that KQ takes a firm stand against all forms of human trafficking. She said the airline fully supports the elimination of the exploitation of human beings and modern slavery. "We, therefore, stand against all forms of human trafficking, fully support the elimination of the exploitation of human beings and modern slavery and will not condone human trafficking in any part of our organization." Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen said the ministry has affected a number of solutions to strengthen the transport system against trafficking. "This includes thorough scrutiny of travel documents, vetting of drivers and passengers aboard PSVs, trucks, and private vehicles, enlisting of public support in reporting suspected cases of human trafficking, sensitisation of transport operators on the effects of human trafficking on the victims, and introduction of a code of conduct to be signed by transport operators," he said. The CS commended KQ for the step they have taken to combat trafficking in persons. "The airline has developed action points that have protected its systems from being misused to facilitate the transportation of human trafficking victims. We are keen on ensuring such measures are replicated by other players in the sector through closer collaboration," he said.
