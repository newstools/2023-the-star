Kenya Volleyball Federation national sports organising secretary Ishmael Chege has said the women's league matches will go on this weekend as planned despite calls for postponement. On Monday, secretary of the beach volleyball commission Sammy Mulinge made a passionate appeal for the federation to postpone the matches. This is because it collides with the National Olympic Committee of Kenya NOC-K beach games that will also be played on March 18-19 at Buntwani Waterfront  Park, Malindi. Mulinge argued that most of the players that play conventional volleyball are also in beach volleyball. But Chege maintained that the communication from NOC-K came late after the federation had already released the fixtures. "The fixtures were already out by the time NOC-K conveyed their information. Clubs said it will be hard to reschedule the matches. We had thought of assigning the fixtures new dates but again the Africa Club Championship is around the corner and teams will need adequate time to prepare," Chege said. "If NOC-K had communicated earlier,  we could have adjusted the date but now it is too late," he added.
