Spaniard Jorge Campillo has attributed his third career DP World Tour win in the Magical Kenya Open to calmness and resilience. Campillo fired a four-day total of 18 under par 266 with scores of 69, 68, 63, and 66 to seal the coveted title before an enthusiastic crowd at the Par 71 Muthaiga Golf course. In winning the coveted title and the red jacket, the Spaniard pocketed Sh43 million and an elegant rhino trophy presented by Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, who stood in for HE President William Ruto. What’s more, Campillo moved to 8th place in the DP World Tour standings behind leader Victor Perez from France and Rory Mcilroy. “I’m on cloud nine. It’s such a nice feeling, to win a tournament of this calibre. I am proud of the fact that I got the lead going into the last round and was able to close it out,” said Campillo. He added: “I am very happy with the outcome considering this is a tricky golf course and you know that you have to hit the ball well to shoot low scores. I am just proud of the way I played. It’s my third season on the European tour and 12th year, so I have been on the tour for a while and this is my third win. It’s a great pleasure playing in the DP World Tour.” An emotional Campillo recalled the days he graced the Kenyan event on his second Challenge Tour in 2011 at Muthaiga. “I never dreamed I would come back here and win my third golf tournament on the DP World Tour. It’s such a nice feeling. These guys on the DP World Tour play so well and I’m getting older, so you have to be ready for the season. I can be more relaxed now, try to get more wins maybe. I feel like I perform better under pressure than when I’m relaxed.” Kenya’s Mutahi Kibugu fired a tournament total of 1 under par 283 with scores of 68,71, 71 and 73 to win a prize money total of Sh528 million. Mutahi described his performance as surreal. The 22-year-old Kenyan golfer tied for 65 at the end of the four-day 72-hole stroke-play extravaganza. Kibugu savoured all the attention he got from the home fans in his very first Magical Kenya Open as a professional. “All the support I got this week was just amazing. I can’t thank everyone enough for what they’ve done this week,” he quipped. He added: “I’m pretty pleased with how I played over the four days. I didn’t have my best stuff in the last three. Round two and three I managed to put together a score. Today (Sunday) I just let it go early on the back nine. But I finished strong, have my chin up and I’m pleased with my performance.” Kibugu will return to South Africa where he will partake in a few events on the Sunshine Tour. He concluded: “I’m going to take all the positives out of this week, head back down to SA, and try to pre-Q for some events. Definitely, try and play more and more. I’m getting the rhythm and I’m heading in the right direction.” Japanese Masahiro Kawamura came second with 16 under par 268 gross whilst another Spaniard Santiago Tarrio and Japanese Ryo Hisatsune tied for third place on 15 under par 269. Campillo played great golf all day, besides that little short putt he missed on the 11th.
