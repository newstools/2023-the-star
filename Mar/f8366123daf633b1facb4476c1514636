Fifteen elite Football Kenya Federation coaching instructors have begun a 10-day training program at the Kenya Institute of Special Education in Nairobi. Abraham Mebratu, an Ethiopian instructor assigned by the Confederation of African Football (Caf), will lead the training. Mebratu, who also works as a technical consultant for the world football governing body, Fifa, stated that the participants would be accredited once they complete their course. "Caf has created a new coaching convention and we require more instructors educated in this convention. We will acknowledge the instructors at the end of this course based on their level and performance throughout the next 10 days," Mebratu said. According to Mebratu, instructors play a vital role in the growth of football. "Once you have excellent instructors, you can have quality coaches, and those coaches will generate quality players, and then we can have a beautiful game and a good national team, both female and male, in all age groups," Mabretu said. "This is a step in a great direction, we need trained instructors to improve the capacity of local coaching. We are fortunate to have one of the first training of this type in Africa." Football Kenya Federation chief executive officer, Barry Otieno, said the course provides an opportunity for Kenyan coaches to develop technical skills both at home and overseas. "I urge you to take this as an opportunity; Caf may select some of you to assist in the delivery of coaching courses across Africa, which will benefit both you and Kenya."
