Kakamega governor Fernandez Barasa has condemned the decision of the Supreme Court of Kenya that gave LGBTQ members the right to form associations. Speaking while distributing the County government-subsidized fertilizer and seed at Murhanda grounds in Shinyalu constituency on Wednesday, Barasa said he supports the Church and Members of Parliament who are opposed to LGBTQ in the Country. The County boss was responding to a Friday judgement by the Supreme Court judges that gave the green light for the registration of LGBTQ as a society. “It is unethical, against our religious norms and the African culture, and we cannot support Lesbianism, Gaysim and other queer practices that don’t make sense in our society. “We won’t allow our people to lose their culture and we are against the court ruling," Governor Barasa asserted. “I want it to be on record that as Kakamega County we condemn the Supreme Court for legalising registration of associations that are proponents of Gay and Lesbian activities in the country. We cannot support that whatsoever.”
