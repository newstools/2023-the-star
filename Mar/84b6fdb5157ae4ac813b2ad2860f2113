Former President Uhuru Kenyatta's cousin Kung'u Muigai has denied allegations that he had been sent by President William Ruto to convince Uhuru to denounce Azimio, a political outfit led by Raila Odinga. It was earlier rumoured that Ruto had urged Kung’u Muigai and Eala MP Kanini Kega to convince Uhuru to recognise the current administration. Recently, while attending the burial of former Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha, Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged Raila as his party leader. Speaking with the Star on Wednesday, Kungu dismissed the claims as mere creations of social media and said he had sent him to speak to Uhuru. “No one has sent me to talk to Uhuru and I would like to set the record straight, the stories circulating online are the creation of social media,” Kung’u said. He maintained that Ruto has never sent him to strike a handshake with Uhuru. Muigai was vocal about his support for the Kenya Kwanza administration and, in particular, President William Ruto in the run for the 2022 General Election. Sports CS Ababu Namwamba recently appointed Kungu Muigai to chair the Kenya Cultural Centre Council board. The retired army captain will serve in the position for a period of two years. "In exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 (1) of the Kenya Cultural Centre Act, the Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Culture and the Arts appoints Kungu Muigai to be a member and Chairperson of the Board of the Kenya Cultural Centre Council," the statement read.
