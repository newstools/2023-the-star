Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba wants a section of Bomet County Stadium demolished and reconstructed afresh in a bid to meet international standards. Namwamba said the facility, which stalled after being put up by the Bomet county government in 2014, will receive a face-lift and will be redeveloped under a new master plan which was produced by the government. While on an inspection tour of the facility, Namwamba said the stadium was developed haphazardly hence the reason why it needs to be redone. “Some of the structures will be pulled down because they were not done according to the required standards hence they pose a major risk to the public,” he said. He said once they are through with the technical assessment of structures to be demolished, they will give information to Kenyans on the transformation plans they have for the stadium because it is a priority project. “In that spirit, we have announced all-new stadiums will only be developed under a new coherent master plan that will give Kenyans details on cost and the purpose of the facilities,” said Namwamba. He added that the stadium, which has a capacity of 30,000 seats, will not only host football matches but also other sporting activities so that it can help tap talent across the board. “Bomet is the home of international athletes and given a chance, it can contribute to changing the country’s landscape as far as sports is concerned.” Even though the CS did not specify the timeline, he noted that the technical team is currently working on the plan and as soon as they are ready, the development of the stadium will start. In attendance were Bomet governor Prof Hillary Barchok, Sports Kenya director general Pius Metto and Bomet County commissioner Dr. Ahmed Omar. Barchok said the CS visit to the stadium is the culmination of President William Ruto’s request to have the stadium completed after it has been grounded since 2014.
