Over 1000 athletes are expected for the inaugural Agnes Tirop Memorial Fun Run set for this Sunday at the Koitalel Samoei University in Mosoriot, Nandi county. Besides athletics, the event will also feature cycling, which will cover  42km in memory of the late former world cross country champion Agnes Tirop. Viola Lagat, who is one of the founders and chairperson for the Agnes Tirop Angels, said the day will be full of activities to commemorate the two-time world 10,000m bronze medalist. Lagat, a former New York Marathon runner up,  said Tirop's family has partnered with Adidas, Athletics Kenya and Koitalel Samoei University to honour the fallen hero. “As a family, we want to honour the great athlete in this race. We are hosting the Agnes Tirop Memorial on Sunday, where there will be so many sporting activities,” she said. She highlighted that there will be the fun run, 3km corporate run and kids 1km race. All races, she said, will be run along Kabiyet Road and end at Koitalel Samoei University. She equally noted that cyclists will also cover the 42km on the Kabiyet before returning at the starting point. Lagat said they are working hard to ensure  Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is fully eradicated. "We are yet to achieve our target and we still have a long way to go but we will get there," he said. “We are just in the first phase of our battle against GBV. Agnes is just one of the people who have lost their lives through GBV and we must continue hammering the point home," she noted.
