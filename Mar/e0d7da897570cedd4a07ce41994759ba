Former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has arrived at the DCI headquarters for grilling. Matiang'i is expected to be grilled over claims of publication of false information. His appearance follows a summons by the DCI on Monday. The former CS is accompanied by a host of politicians including his former colleague Eugene Wamalwa. Matiang’i is accused of spreading false information about an alleged invasion of a raid in his Karen residence by a group of police officers between 8th and 9th of February 2023. Some of the charges that have been put against the former CS is that he caused publication of false information contrary to Section 23 of the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crimes Act of 2018 among other offences. He maintains he never talked to any public officer regarding the issue. This is in regard to a failed raid on his Karen house on February 8. Head of serious crime Michael Sang, says he believes Matiang’i could either be connected to the offence or could give information that could assist in investigation. Matiang’i jetted back into the country Saturday.
