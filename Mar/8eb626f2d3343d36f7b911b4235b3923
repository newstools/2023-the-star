KCB RFC skipper Curtis Lilako wants teammates to intensify training ahead of next week's Kenya Cup final against champions Kabras in Kakamega. The former Kenya international says the focus this week will be to improve their discipline at the breakdown and contact area in what promises to be a tough final. “ I am glad we got the win against Oilers in the semifinal but there are areas which I know we have to improve to give ourselves a chance of reclaiming the title we last won two years ago," added Lilako. It was sweet revenge for the bankers who lost 24-19 to the Oilers at the same stage last year. Kabras and KCB clashed a fortnight ago in Ruaraka with the sugar millers winning 29-23. However, Lilako observed the final will be a different ball game altogether. “ It comes down to mentality and who can handle the pressure well. Defense and execution will also play a key role if we can get it right,” he noted. Lilako added: “We have had a good run, some beautiful games, some tough ones but we are grateful that we are into the finals. I urge my boys not to lose focus and continue with this spirit to ensure we finish this season with the trophy.” In the semifinal win over Oilers,  KCB led 26-5 following a dominant first half then had to survive nervy second half to win 38-20. Try scorers for the hosts were fullback Darwin Mukidza, Max Kangeri, Curtis Lilako, Samuel Asati and Michael Kimwele. They all touched down once each with Mukidza adding four conversions for the win. Oilers' tries were scored by Chrispin Shitundo, Coleman Were and Samson Onsomu with Geoffrey Ominde adding a  conversion and two penalties. In the other semi, Kabras edged Quins 22-8 to book their spot in the final for the eighth consecutive time. This will be the sixth meeting between KCB and Kabras in the final with the bankers winning all five encounters.
