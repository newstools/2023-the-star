Kayole starlets head coach Joshua Sakwa has said the team will play in the Division One league next season. This is because the team is mathematically out of the Kenya Women's Premier League. Kayole have minus nine points (-9) in 12 matches and are yet to win a match this season. The team remains bottom of the 12-team league. There are 10 matches left to end the season but Kayole are already planning for life in the second tier according to Sakwa. "Our hopes of maintaining top-flight status are impossible if not over. We are already relegated after losing 3-0 against Wadadia over the weekend." The bottom two teams will be relegated. Zetech Sparks, Kisumu All Starlets and Kengemi Ladies are also candidates for relegation unless performances improve. "The last teams fighting relegation so far have 13 points each. When will we erase the negative tally? Can we afford to beat Vihiga, Gaspo, Ulinzi, Nakuru? This is a mission impossible," Sakwa observed. Explaining on the points deduction Sakwa said: "We did not honor our matches against Bunyore Starlets and Kangemi Ladies. Against Kangemi, security was the issue but the bottom line is financial problems are a letdown." Sakwa wants to channel his energy on building a young and vibrant team that will immediately be promoted back to the league. "The young players are patient, play with commitment with a point to prove. They will be the best option to play in the lower tier. "
