Former CS Fred Matiang'i today expected to appear at the DCI headquarters to shed light on his alleged home raid. The summons was served on Monday afternoon at the Milimani Law Court to his lawyer Danstan Omari who protested. The summons by Senior Superintendent Michael Sang was served by an officer by the name, Mishack at 1.15 pm However, even though Omari received the summons, he signed the summons that he was served in court under protest. Matiang’i's lawyer Danstan Omari has confirmed that he was indeed served with the summons even though in protest. Omari says that the said officers went to the CS home to serve but did not find him and after reaching out to Matiang’i, he directed them to go serve his lawyer Omari. The officers went to Milimani Law Courts to serve Omari who says the reason he has protested the summons is because of the timing. “I was being served at 1.15 PM and they require the CS to appear at 9 AM, considering I have court matters and I have to take instructions from my client on his itinerary, it's short notice,” Omari says. Omari has however said the CS is willing and ready to appear before the DCI but that will be subject to the diary of his lawyers.
