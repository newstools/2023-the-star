Sophia Jepchirchir yesterday said the painful memories of losing a friend two years ago pushed her to victory during the inaugural Agnes Tirop Fun Run. Jepchichir said she was not meant to run the race but was prompted by the bitter memories of losing Tirop who was her mentor. “I ran this race with a lot of pain of losing a loved one and I am glad I won it for her," said Jepchirchir. Jepchirchir won the 10km women's race in 33:02 ahead of experienced Feliciana Jepkosgei at 33:57 and Brenda Tuwei, who settled for third place in  34:05. She recalled their friendship with a lot of pain, saying she wouldn't have been where she is without Tirop. She said before the race started, She saw a picture of Tirop on one of the lead cars and this made it even more complicated for her. " The picture took me down memory lane of our good times with Tirop and this pushed her to victory. What happened to her should not happen again to anyone," she said. In a race held at the Koitaleel Samoei University in Mosoriot, Nandi County, Emmanuel Maru won the men's race at 29:33 ahead of Kelvin Biwott (29:33) and Philip Tarus (29:41). Maru, who hails from Elgeyo Marakwet and trains in Iten, said he was happy to have won the race in memory of a great athlete whom they used to train together in Iten. “I am happy for the win despite picking up an injury. I had to train well for this event knowing it was a hard course but Iten being at a higher altitude, I managed to beat all,” said Maru, who is a specialist in the 5,000m and 10,000m.
