Reigning women champions Kenya Ports Authority will unveil their Nigerian new signing Ifunaya Okoro during their Kenya National Basketball League fixture in Mombasa on March 18. The unbeaten porters, who are seventh on the log with 26 points from 13 games, start their second leg campaign against the University of Nairobi “Dynamites” at their Makande Welfare hall next week. KPA coach Anthony Ojukwu said with Okoro in the team, the focus remains to defend the title and book a ticket to represent the country in another continental championship. “Her teammates have embraced her and the training is going well. We are covering every aspect of the game,” Opined Ojukwu. He went on, “She is very sharp, energetic, and really enjoying her stay. She will get her time and I believe she will bring some energy.” The guard featured for KPA in the FIBA Africa Champions Cup Women's campaign in Maputo, Mozambique in December and was one of the top performers in the show. Okoro scored a staggering 35 points against CNSS of DR Congo and was also named in the tournament’s best five. She joined KPA in the event alongside compatriot Theresa Dangosu. KPA were 2-2 in the preliminary round before being eliminated by Egyptian side Alexandria Sporting, the championship eventual winners. The other new signing is Hilda ‘Dante’ Ndegwa who moved from Equity Bank Hawks. Ojukwu said she will bring her experience and knowledge of the game to the team. KPA men who are in ninth place with 26 points from 13 matches,  will also return to action with a game against UoN "Terrorists". KPA men have lost only one fixture going down to bottom side Africa Nazarene University “Wolfpacks” in a shocking result.
