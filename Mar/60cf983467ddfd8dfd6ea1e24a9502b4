Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has responded to the question of whether he is a bitter man. While responding to questions during a media roundtable on Sunday, Gachagua said he is not bitter. He went on to say that Kenyans have every right to describe him however they want, but one thing he knows is that he is a truthful man. "Kenyans have every right to describe my character. I speak from my heart I say what is in my heart. I'm a truthful man," the DP said. He noted that Kenyans are not used to the truth. Gachagua also said that he welcomes criticism from all quotas, but will never change who he is. The DP said he knows the people that matter to him and his leadership. "I accept and welcome criticism from media and social media... I will never change who I am... I know who matters to me and my leadership is the Kenyan." He added that the Kenya Kwanza administration is also not bitter with anyone. "We are not bitter with anybody. When I said in Kasarani that we found empty coffers I was just saying the truth," Gachagua said.
