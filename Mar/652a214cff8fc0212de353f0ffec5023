Interviews for the 240 candidates shortlisted for the CAS positions end today paving way for President William Ruto to finalise the constitution of his government. The interviews which started last week saw a total of 48 candidates appear in the five-day exercise. Commission's chairperson Anthony Muchiri told the Star in an interview that they will submit the names of suitable picks in three days. "In the next two to three days after the conclusion of this process we shall forward the names of suitable individuals," he said. He did not, however, disclose the number. Muchiri stated that each of the candidates is allocated 30 minutes and undergoes a similar process where they are awarded a score. Once the President receives the names, he will pick 22 individuals of his choice and designate them to each of the ministries before sending the list back to Parliament for vetting. At the National Assembly, relevant committees will vet the particular nominees and later make a report for either adoption or rejection by the House. If approved, the list will be returned back to the President for appointment. Among those to be vetted today are former Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, Korei Lemein, Christopher Langat, Joseph Limo, Victor Munyaka, Vincent Kemosi and Ahmed Muktar among others. The office holder is responsible for helping the CS to better coordinate the affairs of their respective ministries. They also help in coordinating work by the state departments.
