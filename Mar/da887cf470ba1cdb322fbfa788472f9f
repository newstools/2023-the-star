Opposition chief Raila Odinga will on Friday meet a key organ of the ODM party that brings together all the 47 county chairpersons. Raila, who is also the ODM party leader, will hold talks with the ODM county chairpersons caucus as he lays the ground for a major revamp of the party. The meeting will take place from 10 am at the Convent Hotel, Nairobi. The party chairpersons caucus is an important organ of the ODM party that oversees activities at the county level. It mainly comprises influential party bigwigs with a number of them being either governors, senators or members of parliament. Nairobi ODM county chairperson George Aladwa, who is also the Makadara MP, said the meeting will plan party revamp activities. "We are meeting the party leader to plan our activities across the country as we plan for grassroots mobilisation initiatives," Aladwa said. Aladwa who chairs the county chairpersons caucus said the grassroots leaders will be critical in the party's planned activities in the coming days. The meeting comes at a time when Raila has escalated his anti-government crusade with countrywide protests expected to start next week. Raila is also keen on cracking the whip among the errant party members hobnobbing with President William Ruto's Kenya Kwanza alliance. The purge is expected to hit Members of the County Assemblies who have expressed their open dalliance with Ruto. Raila has maintained that he does not recognise Ruto as president insisting his administration is illegitimate.
