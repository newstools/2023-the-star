Abigael Chebet and Sharon Chepkogei will be part of the Africa Youth Games volleyball team that will play in Congo Brazaville in April. National Women's beach Volleyball coach Salome Wanjala said the duo who was part of the third edition of the Youth Camp held in Merishaw International School in January, will be given priority. Wanjala who doubles up as Nairobi Prisons women's volleyball coach said: "Of course Chebet and Chepkogei are some of the players that have shown promise and we would like them to savour their chances at the international level." The African Youth Games is a multi-sport event held every four years as a prelude to the Summer Youth Olympics. The games had earlier been scheduled for 2022 in Egypt but were later on postponed. Wanjala was part of the Kenya Prisons team between 2009-2015. She joined KCB in 2017 and left in 2019. She also enjoyed a six-year spell with national women's team, Malkia Strikers. Wanjala hopesÂ  they will have more players for camp training this time round. "The time we had in Isinya was too short but we could have had more. By the time we head into the camp, I believe we will be given three or four pairs of players to help us put our act together in training."
