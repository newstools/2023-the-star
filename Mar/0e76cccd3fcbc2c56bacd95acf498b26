A Russian fighter jet has collided with a US drone, causing the unmanned aircraft to crash into the Black Sea, the American military says. It says the drone was on a routine mission in international airspace when two Russian jets tried to intercept it. The US European command said the crash was the result of an "unprofessional act by the Russians". US and allied forces will continue to operate in the area, it added. There is no word on the incident from Russia. "Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9," said US Air Force Gen James Hecker. MQ-9 Reaper drones are large unmanned aircraft designed for high-altitude surveillance.
