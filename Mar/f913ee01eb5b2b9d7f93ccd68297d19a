Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Monday met with his former high school classmates at Harambee House Annex. In a statement, Gachagua said together with his former schoolmates they recalled their journey at Kianyaga High School. "It was momentous spending three good hours at Harambee House Annex with former schoolmates at Kianyaga High School, where my journey to success and leadership began 45 years ago today," he said. "We traced our old days at "Kalahari" as the school is still known for being in a hot and dry area." The DP said that they agreedÂ to give back to the school that prepared them for greater things in life. Gachagua said they will mobilise all the alumni and teachers to meet at the school on March 18, 2023. He said the team will meet to assess the needs of the institution and chart the way forward to improving its performance. "Our no-nonsense Headteacher Julius Kano Ndumbi will be the Chief Guest flanked by all teachers who taught us, as well as members of the support staff who took care of us," he said.
