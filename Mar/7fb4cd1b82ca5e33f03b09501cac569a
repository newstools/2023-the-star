Narck-Kenya leader Martha Karua on Saturday warned security officers against being misused by the State during their planned rallies. Karua reminded the officers of their constitutional obligations of protecting life and property saying they should not overstep it. She stated that the demonstrations are allowed in the Constitution and the police should not in any way disrupt, injure or kill the protesters adding their rallies are peaceful. Karua was speaking during the Azimio rally in Narok Saturday. "Ukiona mkenya pigia yeye salute na uwache aendelee na kazi zake za maandamano," said Karua. Loosely translates to: 'If you see a Kenyan, just salute them and let them continue with protests.' She said any officer who in a way oversteps their mandate to infringe on the rights of Kenyans risks being taken to International criminal court. "We have seen across the World that when a country fails to use its laws effectively on human rights, International laws are applied," she noted. Arguing their demands to the Kenya Kwanza administration affects even the security officers, Karua said there was need for them to keep any attempts aimed at suppressing them. "Wewe uko na taabu kama mkenya wacha baba akutetee. Unganeni nasi tuikomboe hii nchi, wewe kama uko ndani ya serikali kumbuka uko na shida kama wakenya wengine," she remarked. The opposition demos are slowly picking up as a number of counties took to the streets to protest the high cost of living. This was after Raila declared the start of mass action against the Kenya Kwanza regime which he termed illegitimate. Raila said they have invoked the provisions of the Constitution to launch a massive peaceful movement of defiance against an illegal government. "Take note that on the 20th of March 2023, we have a date with destiny in Nairobi. On that day our supporters throughout the country shall stage a massive procession in Nairobi for a legitimate and inclusive government. Save the date," Raila said.
