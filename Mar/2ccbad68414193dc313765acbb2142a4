The Football Kenya Federation Women's Premier League first leg ends this weekend with Thika Queens banking on the result between Gaspo and Vihiga Queens to determine their position on the log. Gaspo face Vihiga at Mumias Sports Complex on Saturday while Thika visit Zetech at GEMs Cambridge. Thika are joint-second alongside Gaspo on 21 points, with the later dropping to third at the back of an inferior goal difference. Vihiga are top of the table with 22 point and failure to get a result against Gaspo, will send Thika top with a win over Zetech. Thika head coach Fred Majani said they are fully charged in their quest for maximum points at Cambridge. “I am well prepared to ensure we collect the three points at Cambridge. We also hope that the result in the match between Gaspo and Vihiga goes our way,” Majani said. Also on Saturday, Trans Nzoia Falcons will be battling Kisumu All Starlets while Ulinzi Starlets face Kayole at Ulinzi Sports Complex. Kayole, bottom of the table with -9 points and -37 goal difference, are perfect candidates for relegation. On Sunday, Bunyore Starlets will visit Nakuru City Queens at ASK grounds while Wadadia host Kangemi Ladies at Mumias Complex. Nakuru coach James Angila said he is determined to finish the first leg with 20 points. Nakuru are fourth with 17 points while Bunyore Starlets are a point less at fifth. Bunyore head coach Daniel Arunga said this is a must-win match.
