The Azimio la Umoja on Tuesday suffered a double blow after a section of its leaders from Taita Taveta County decamped to the ruling UDA. Newly installed UDA secretary general Cleophas Malala received the defectors at the party's headquarters at the Hustler Centre in Nairobi. "The Hustler Centre in Nairobi was a beehive of activities today as leaders from Taita Taveta led by Hon. Simon Mwachia (Jubilee), Hon. Christopher Mwambingu (ODM), Hon. Jason Tuja (Odm), Hon. Martha Kenio (Jubilee), Hon. Collins Mzughulla (Jubilee) defected to UDA," Malala said. Present during the event were Mathira MP Erick Wamumbi and Nominated Senator, Gloria Orwoba. "I was privileged to receive them alongside Chache MP Hon. Japheth Nyakundi, Hon. Bigvai Mwalemi, Hon. Noelina Adagala (Bura Ward), Hon. Beatrice Mkapesa, Hon. Milton Masale among other leaders," Malala added. The former Kakamega senator said the leaders pledged to support President William Ruto's agenda amid an impending push-up against the regime Azimio has termed as illegitimate. The defections came on the same day former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and a section of Nyanza ODM leaders decamped to UDA. Kidero said the Azimio party is only interested in protests that don’t make progress in people’s lives. “We are joining a party that cares about its people. Not a party like the one we have left. That it is only interested in chaos," he said. Six Kenya Kwanza affiliate parties also folded and officially joined UDA on Tuesday. They are Umoja na Maendeleo, Farmers Party, Chama Cha Mashinani, Chama cha Kazi, National Agenda Party Of Kenya and Economic Freedom Party. The parties will cease to exist upon the ratification of their dissolution by the Registrar of Political Parties.
