Vice-chancellor at the University of Nairobi Stephen Kiama said when he was appointed to serve, he found the boy child under siege. Kiama explained the measures he took to bring back the glory of male students in the institution. He was speaking during an event to celebrate the boy child at UoN on Thursday. “I initiated, through the Senate, a program called Pardon Advisory Committee (PAC) working with Students Appeals and Disciplinary Committee (SADC) to reinstate and rehabilitate the wayward students,” Kiama said. When he took over in 2020, Kiama said he found over 500 students (all being Boy Child) had been expelled for several crimes. The varsity management instituted several measures to correct their menace. “I am happy to note that we have managed to re-admit 344 students whom we have given the Academic Division and Dean of Students Office,” he said. Kiama added that the department will rehabilitate, mentor and release them. The UoN boss added that the varsity has registered over 1,000 students in Work Study Program. “They work as custodians, cleaners, security, customer care assistants, gardeners, library assistants and office administrators just to mention a few,” he said. He reiterated that the Work Study Program has brought in a sense of responsibility to students.
