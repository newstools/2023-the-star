Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has lauded women for breaking barriers and excelling in technology. Waiguru was speaking during the International Women’s Day celebrations held at KICC on Thursday. She noted that the number of women in the technology world is rising by the day. "The national skyline is brighter with more colorful minds of women as CEOs in boardrooms, Chairpersons, Chief, Governors and Legislators,” Waiguru said. This year's theme for the celebrations was Innovation and Technology for gender equality. The Chair of the Council of Governors said innovation and digital transformation, including the presence of internet and smartphones, have provided avenues for women to access opportunities in education and careers. "Counties continue to support mentorship for girls in Vocational Training Centres in a bid to encourage their uptake of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses and careers.” the COG Chair said. Waiguru called for urgent measures to address the digital divide that exists in many communities to ensure that everyone, regardless of their gender or socioeconomic status, has access to affordable and reliable internet connectivity. "There is a need to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas so that everyone can benefit from the latest advances in technology," she said. According to the governor, inclusive innovation and technology also mean designing technology and systems that are gender-responsive. Waiguru said despite the progress made in legislation and policy formulation, gender inequality particularly in innovation continues to persist. “As a woman, I know first-hand the challenges that women face in accessing and participating meaningfully in technology and innovation," she said. She lamented that women are often underrepresented in the STEM sector. Additionally, they are disproportionately affected by the negative impacts of technology.
