Isaac Omurwa is targeting 10.5 seconds in 100m during  the East Africa under 18/20 championships in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania next week. Omurwa, who is the younger brother to Commonwealth Games champion Ferdinand Omanyala (Africa's fastest sprinter over the distance), said he intends to return home with a gold medal. Kenya is set to field  29 athletes for the regional show set for March 14-17. "I would like to see myself clock 10.5 seconds and below. I managed 10.7 seconds in the trials at Nyayo but I can do a lot more. Not just a podium finish but winning gold is a real possibility." Omurwa 18, is Alliance high school alumnus having finished his form four studies last year. He managed second position in the national school championships and a fourth place in the East Africa category in 2022. "I have trained fully for three months for the first time in my career. At school, I had little time to train because academics is valued at Alliance. My coach was impressed with my performance at Nyayo but there's room for improvement." Omurwa added that he looks up to Omanyala for inspiration. "I want to break all the records set by my brother.  He is a motivation to me. He has navigated his way to the top despite the challenges." The regional meeting will bring together athletes from Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda.
