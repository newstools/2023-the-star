Kenyans on Twitter have taken over social media claiming that Trade CS Moses Kuria popularised China Square. Some said they never knew about China Square until it was closed indefinitely after an uproar by some Nairobi traders. Most Kenyans now say that they will be flocking to the mall to buy cheaper goods. On Monday, the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce (KCCC) announced that China Square has been allowed to continue with its operations after one-week closure. In a statement, the chamber said that several engagements with the Kenyan government have been made to allow China Square to operate. Some of the local traders had complained that China Square was alienating customers—both wholesalers and retailers from them, putting their businesses on the brink of collapse. They said the Chinese entrepreneur is an unfair competitor, skewing the market in its favour and undermining their ventures through low pricing. “We are not against the Chinese guy. Our issue is that he cannot be the one selling us the products in China when we go to import and come here to sell to our customers. Remember we have incurred expenses, including hefty taxes to import,” Jonathan Mwangi, not his real name, told the Star.
