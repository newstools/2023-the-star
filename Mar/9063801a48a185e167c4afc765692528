There was drama at the DCI headquarters on Kiambu Road after police at the gate temporarily stopped former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and his lawyers from accessing the DCI officers. Officers said they wanted to consult first on who should accompany him. This saw the former CS who was in the company of lawyers Danstan Omari, Otiende Amollo and Okongo Omogeni stand outside the gate for almost ten minutes while waiting. The lawyers complained about the move saying it was uncalled for. “You can stop the supporter but the lawyers have to get in,” said Omogeni. Tens of supporters had arrived there and cheered Matiang'i as he alighted from his car. True to his word, he was there by 8.30 am. He was supposed to arrive at 9.30 am as per the summons from the DCI. Matiangí was allowed in with about 14 lawyers at 8.47 am. He looked composed and saluted at a crowd outside the DCI. Matiang’i is accused of spreading false information about an alleged raid at his Karen residence by a group of police officers between February 8 and 9, 2023. Some of the charges that have been put against the former CS is that he caused the publication of false information contrary to Section 23 of the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crimes Act of 2018 among other offences. He maintained he never talked to any public officer regarding the issue. Head of serious crime Michael Sang says he believes that Matiang’i could either be connected to the offence or could give information that could assist in the investigation. Matiang’i jetted back into the country Saturday.
