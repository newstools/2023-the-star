Vihiga Queens bounced back to winning ways after hammering Kangemi Ladies 5-0 in the Women's Premier League match on Saturday. The game played at the Gems Cambridge, Nairobi saw Vihiga take a 1-0 halftime lead courtesy of Providence Khasiala's 43rd minute strike. Khasiala scored her first goal in Vihiga colours after inking a deal with the Legacy Makers in mid-week. Shirleen Opisa grabbed a brace by scoring in the 65th and 78th minute respectively to highlight Vihiga's dominance. The defending champions were not yet done with business as Janet Moraa and Anita Namata completed the rout. Bertha Omita made her second appearance for Vihiga by playing on the left of the attack that had Opisa and Moraa. Khasiala was the only change made by coach Boniface Nyamunyamu to the team that lost 2-0 against Gaspo Women last weekend. Marende Ongachi who started the last three matches as part of a midfield three,Â  dropped to the bench as Khasiala was preferred. Elsewhere, Kisumu All Starlets recovered from 1-0 down at halftime to beat Bunyore starlets 2-1 at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu. Bracksides Itambe had given Bunyore a slim halftime advantage but Monica Etot's second half double sunk Bunyore.
