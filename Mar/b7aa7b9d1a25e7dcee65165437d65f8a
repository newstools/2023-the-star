KCB women's volleyball head coach Japheth Munala says their ultimate goal is to defend their African Club Championship title this year. The annual continental tournament is set for Tunisia in May with Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons also eligible to compete in the week-long assignment.The bankers beat record champions Al Ahly 3-1 in the finals in June last year. KCB, who train at Ruaraka, became the first Kenyan team to win the prestigious continental gong after nine years. Prisons won in 2013. "Our main objective is to go and defend our trophy successfully. All the energy will be channeled toward the African crown. The first step is to get there, win the first match and the rest will fall in place." KCB were beaten 3-1 by Kenya Pipeline to the national league crown in January.Â  The Edith Wisa-captained side put up a spirited fight but collapsed in the last minute to concede defeat. "We panicked especially with our services and that led to our downfall," Munala remembered. Munala also believes his charges have moved on from the loss of star attacker Sharon Chepchumba who departed for Greece last year after the World Championships. Chepchumba was voted the Most Valuable Player in Tunisia and was crucial for KCB. "Chepchumba played a big part in our success. We can now move forward without her. The team is composed and we look forward to achieving something special with the group."
