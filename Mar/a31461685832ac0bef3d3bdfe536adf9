Bungoma county government has warned crooked matatu operators that their licences will be revoked if they fail to use the Bungoma bus park. Speaking on Tuesday during a consultative meeting with the Ministry of Trade, police and PSV operators, Housing and Urban Development CECM Douglas Sasita said licenced matatus operating outside the bus park are earmarked for revocation. "All Matatus should operate within the bus park, those operating from outside will see their licences revoked immediately, let's restore order and beautify Bungoma town," he said. He noted that boarding and drop-off points of passengers should be within the bus park as this will ensure that those who have paid to use the park also benefit. Sasita also stated that all unregistered kiosks will be demolished to clean the town and clear the mess as every business person should use the designated areas. The business people in the transport sector were raising grievances and the challenges facing them during the meeting held at the KIE hall. Players in the transport industry and the county government agreed to work together to foster security and revenue collection to ensure harmonious working relationships. Trade CECM Caroline Makali assured PSV operators of street lights in Bungoma town to promote a 24-hour economy. "The tender to put up street lights has already been awarded and the contractor is already on site, Bungoma town must be lit," she said. Housing and Urban Development chief officer Denson Barasa called on sobriety when handling PSV Operators to enhance good working relationships. "We have to streamline and enforce our working relationship with transport people to ensure we stop obstruction and poor planning that will hurt other players," Barasa said. He added that they are working on training with owners of vehicles to enhance a better working relationship.
