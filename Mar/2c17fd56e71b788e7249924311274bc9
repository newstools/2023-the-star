Kabras coach Carlos Katywa believes Saturday's Kenya Cup final against KCB will be won on physicality, defence and execution. The South African tactician believes his charges have to win in those areas if they harbour ambitions of defending the title they won last year. “Finals are very tricky moments for both teams but if we can keep our cool win the physical battle,  defend well and execute in attack then we will the title,” he added. Katywa, who is in his second year with the sugar millers, termed  Kenya Cup final as the biggest stage in his short coaching career. “To be honest, it is the biggest pressure game of my coaching experience because they are coming here (Kakamega ) on the back of us beating them in the regular season. We need to sit down and look at their game against Oilers and look at our game as well and have a debriefing… and talk about what we need to improve on in our game,” Katywa said. When the two sides met a fortnight ago, Kabras ended KCB's unbeaten run, winning 29-23 and Katywa expects a response from the bankers. “KCB are a good side and they will pose a threat in the final. These are two teams with a number of players on the national team. "It is a top-of-the-table clash and the guys know each other. It is slowly becoming a big rivalry so it is important for us to understand that the team that make the least mistakes will carry the day," he said. Katywa has asked his charges to stick to their structure and game plan. “ In the win against Quins, we lost our way a bit in the first half but we must play to our strength,  dominate territory and possession and be clinical in attack.” The coach hopes to focus on fine-tuning their preparations this week to ensure the boys are in the right frame of mind. “This week will be a lot of mental preparation and ensuring we are in the peak condition ahead of the final,” he added.
