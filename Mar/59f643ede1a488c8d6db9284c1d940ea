ODM leader Raila Odinga has said he is not looking for a handshake with President William Ruto. Speaking during an interview on KTN Tuesday night, Raila dismissed claims that he has been sending emissaries to Ruto for a truce. "I do not know any emissaries who have been sent anywhere. I can say without fear of contradiction that I've not sent anybody to Ruto," he said. Raila said Ruto had also not sent anyone to him. He was reacting to assumptions that his enhanced anti-government rallies are aimed at pressuring the President into a deal. Raila dismissed the remarks by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua that the Azimio coalition was looking for nusu mkate arrangement. "We are not looking for half a loaf. Even under (retired President) Uhuru's government we did not get even a quarter of a loaf," he said. The former Prime Minister said the only time he agreed to share power was in 2008 following mediation by the international community. He said during that time, the Constitution had to be amended to create the position of Prime Minister and share Cabinet slots. "Since that time we have not been in government at all. It's all useless propaganda," he added. Late last year, Ruto presented a memo to Parliament proposing the creation of the office of leader of the Opposition. Raila said he had information from several senior diplomats that in July last year just before the elections, Ruto had plans of being "a powerful opposition leader". "He wanted them to help him pressurise me to create the office of the Opposition," he added, saying Ruto had anticipated a Raila win. After the results were declared, the diplomats approached Ruto to create the office. "That's how he wrote now the position of opposition leader in Parliament. This I have gotten from several diplomats," Raila said.
