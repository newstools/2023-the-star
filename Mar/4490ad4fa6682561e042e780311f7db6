National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula has said the government is ready to deal with and disconnect LGBTQ movements in Kenya. President William Ruto, his deputy Rigathi Gachagua, MPs, Church leaders, lobby groups and MCAs have ganged up and faulted the Supreme Court ruling to allow LGBTQ association in Kenya. Speaking at Kibabii University on Friday, Wetang’ula said he gave members of the National Assembly three hours to discuss the issue. He said Kenya is a society of upright morals and there is no room for social misfits, perverts and those who have inability to distinguish between male and female species. “Kenya is God’s country and we all believe in him, we can’t just allow such bad morals to happen as we watch,” Wetang’ula added. He applauded the head of state and MPs on their firm stand to reject the Supreme Court’s ruling allowing formation of LGBTQ movements in the country. Expressing similar sentiments, Kimilili lawmaker Didmus Barasa called on President Ruto to direct the police to arrest those associated with LGBTQ arguing that it is a criminal act and it is against the will of God. Barasa was speaking at a funeral service in Tongaren constituency on Saturday. Bungoma county deputy speaker Stephen Wamalwa  said MCAs have joined MPs and the President in rejecting LGBTQ.
