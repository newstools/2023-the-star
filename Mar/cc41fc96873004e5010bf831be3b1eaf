Buoyed by the massive home support, Kenya’s lone ranger Mutahi Kibugu replicated yet another level-par score to settle for T44 on the penultimate day of the Magical Kenya Open presented by Absa. Having already posted a 68 on Day One and level par on Friday, Mutahi candidly admitted that he didn’t hit the ball well at his home course in Muthaiga. However,  the 22-year-old Kenyan youngster was glad he managed to scramble the score, which he was happy with at the end of the day. “My putts didn’t drop today. Hopefully, they’ll drop by tomorrow (Sunday) and we’ll see what we can do. It feels amazing. The harder you work, eventually it will come out.” “You don’t know when the hard work will pay off, but eventually it does and it’s starting to show, which I’m very excited about.” Mutahi savoured massive support from the home fans who trailed him through and through on both nines of the course. He added: “It means everything when I’m down and out, making silly drops the crowd picks me back on my feet. when a couple of people shout my name, it lifts me up, keeps my head up, and keeps me positive.” Meanwhile, the tussle for the coveted Kenya Open title is turning out to be a tale of musical chairs. With two different leaders witnessed over the first two days, Saturday’s penultimate round was Spaniard Jorge Campillo’s turn to rule the summit. Campillo fired a round of 8 under par 63 to move up the summit with a three-day total of -13 under par 200. Campillo said: “It was a great round. I played solidly and was able to make a few long putts as well, which helps. I finished great. Four birdies in a row to finish and I didn’t have a chance to make any bogeys. It was a comfortable round. I also putted well, so everything worked out well.” MacIntyre (71-65-65) was happy to move to second place, one stroke adrift of the Spaniard. Billed as the future of Scottish professional golf and a potential Ryder Cup star, MacIntyre will no doubt be among the star attractions in Sunday’s closing round. MacIntyre finally made his presence felt on Kenyan soil with a day's score of 65. “It was a good day in the office. Pretty good off the tee and it’s good to see some putts go in. Overall, the game is in decent shape. Putting is something that has been holding me back, but in the last few days, I’m seeing it go in and I’m feeling comfortable over putts right now. “ SCORES AFTER ROUND 3 1 Jorge CAMPILLO ESP 69- 68- 63- 200 (-13) 2 Robert MACINTYRE SCO 71- 65- 65 -201 (-12) T3 Masahiro KAWAMURA JPN 67- 67- 68 -202 (-11) T3 Jayden SCHAPER RSA 68- 65- 69- 202 (-11) 5 Santiago TARRIO ESP 71- 68 -64-- 203 ( -10) T44 Mutahi KIBUGU KEN 68 -71- 71 -210 (-3)
