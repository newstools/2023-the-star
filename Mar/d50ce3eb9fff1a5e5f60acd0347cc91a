US Ambassador Meg Whitman has said that the United States will stand with the LGBTQ community. In a statement on her Twitter handle on Tuesday, Whitman revealed that in the past week, she met with the LGBTQI+ community and its stakeholders. "Over the past week my team and I met with the LGBTQI+ community and stakeholders to support the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons," she said. "The U.S. proudly advances efforts to protect LGBTQI+ persons from discrimination and violence and will continue to stand up for human rights and equality." The community has been on the receiving end of counterblasts since the Supreme Court made a ruling allowing the legal registration of the rights group. "It would be unconstitutional to limit the right to associate through denial of registration of an association purely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the applicants," the court ruled. Since the controversial decision was made, the country has been divided on opinion as LGBTQ rights groups have warned members of the community to stay safe, fearing for their physical safety. The debate has seen both leaders in the government and the opposition take one stance; condemning LGBTQ relations in the country. On March 2, President William Ruto said the country had values that ought to be respected. "We respect the court but I will not allow it in Kenya. We have our culture and traditions, we respect our constitution and all our religions," he said. The opposition leader Raila Odinga said there was no room for same-sex marriage in Kenya, quoting Article 45 (2) of the 2010 Constitution. "Every adult has the right to marry a person of the opposite sex, based on the free consent of the parties." Parents and religious leaders also weighed in on the same, opposing the Apex courtâ€™s decision. The US views LGBTQ rights as human rights. Speaking earlier on March 3, Whitman said the working relationship between the two countries was not going to be affected by their different views on the subject.
