Three people were on Wednesday arrested at Bungoma airstrip over bribery allegations during the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) recruitment exercise. Addressing the press at her office, Christine Natome, the region EACC manager said they received information that a ranger at Kenya Wildlife Service based at Njambini post in Aberdares national park was at the recruitment centre intending to bribe the recruiting officers in order to recruit his brother-in-law. Natome added that EACC officers identified the two and monitored their movements. She said that at some point, the brother-in-law was eliminated from the recruitment because he did not meet the height requirement of 5.6 feet. However, Natome said that the brother-in-law was procedurally taken back to the recruitment area with the help of the third suspect. She said that the EACC officers arrested the three, searched them and recovered money amounting to Sh240,000 from them. Natome told the Star that the suspects were taken to EACC offices in Bungoma where they were interviewed and their statements taken. “The three suspects are still detained here at the EACC officers continue with the probe. We want to ensure that they serve as an example to others who are intending to bribe,” she noted. She said that thereafter, they will be taken to Bungoma police station and be arraigned for the offence of offering a bribe contrary to sections 5(1) and (2) as read with section 18(1) and (2) of the bribery act 2016.
