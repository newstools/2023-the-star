Kenya will send representatives in six of the seven disciplines at the seventh edition of the Commonwealth Youth Games set for August 4-11 in Trinidad and Tobago. Kenya will field both genders in swimming, athletics, cycling and triathlon. Rugby and volleyball will only feature women according to information posted on the National Olympic Committee of Kenya twitter account. Netball is the only discipline in which Kenya won't field athletes in the games that will feature athletes aged between 14 and 18 years. The games were initially scheduled for August 1-7, 2021 but were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The scheduling of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and the 2022 Commonwealth Games were also a factor. The 2023 Commonwealth Youth Games will be the first to be held since the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the accession of King Charles III as head of the CommonwealthÂ and the reigning monarch of the Commonwealth Realms on September 8, 2022. Belfast submitted an official bid to host the games in 2015 but were stripped of the Games in 2018 due to the uncertainty that surrounded the funding for the event during the absence of a functioning Northern Ireland Committee. Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, won the rights to host the championship in June 2019 after second selection.
