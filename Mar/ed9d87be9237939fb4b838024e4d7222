The BBC on Monday announced that Gary Lineker will return to hosting Match of the Day this coming weekend after the two parties reached an agreement over social media use.  BBC director general Tim Davie announced an independent review will be carried out on social media guidelines. Lineker said he backs the review and is looking forward to getting back on the air. He said the last few days had been "surreal" and thanked people for their "incredible support". "I am glad that we have found a way forward. I support this review and look forward to getting back on the air,” said Lineker. “I want to thank you all for the incredible support, particularly my colleagues at BBC Sport, for the remarkable show of solidarity. Football is a team game but their backing was overwhelming. "I have been presenting sport on the BBC for almost 3 decades and am immeasurably proud to work with the best and fairest broadcaster in the world. I cannot wait to get back in the MOTD chair on Saturday,” he said. Weekend football coverage across the BBC was disrupted due to walkouts triggered by Lineker's suspension. In a statement, Mr Davie said: "Everyone recognises this has been a difficult period for staff, contributors, presenters and, most importantly, our audiences. "I apologise for this." Lineker posted a tweet in which he compared the Government's language concerning asylum seekers, to that used in 1930s Germany. The BBC announced that Gary Lineker will step away from his role as Match of the Day presenter until an "agreed and clear position" is reached on his social media use. The decision sparked significant criticism of the BBC, with fellow experts refusing to take part in the BBC's weekly football programming in support of Lineker.
