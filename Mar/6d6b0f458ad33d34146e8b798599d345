More than 10 estates in Kisumu are facing partial water supply interruption due to low water levels at River Kibos. Kisumu Water and Sanitation Company said low water levels have affected the production capacity at Kajulu water treatment plant, which abstracts water from River Kibos. The company's managing director Thomas Odongo has subsequently urged customers to use water sparingly. He said the company was balancing production from Dunga water treatment plant to ensure equitable distribution of water to all customers. “This exercise has led to partial supply interruption in areas normally served from Dunga,” Odongo said. The affected areas include Milimani, parts of CBD, Arina, Russia, Manyatta, Migosi, Robert Ouko, Nubia, Tom Mboya and USAID. Others are industrial area, Polyview, Nyamasaria, Ondiek, Lumumba, United Mall, Avenue Hospital and the surrounding estates The MD appealed to customers to store enough water during this period. He also advised them to collaborate in conserving the environment by planting trees and practising environmentally friendly activities to preserve the available natural resources.
