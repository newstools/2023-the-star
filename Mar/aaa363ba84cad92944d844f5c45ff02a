They should fit you well, not too baggy or too tight. Choose the right colour that compliments your skin's undertone and your body shape. Try them out in the store before settling on which one to buy. Choose the right top Crop tops often balance and highlight aladdin pants well. If you are not comfortable with a crop top, choose a top/t-shirt that sits just above the pants when you wear it. It can be slightly loose or fit but not baggy. If you are wearing a long t-shirt, tuck it in slightly loose. Let the pants be the focus of your outfit Keep the tops, accessories, and other pieces to avoid looking like so much is going on.
