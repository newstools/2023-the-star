The MP spoke on Sunday during a church service in Machakos. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua attended the service. Leaders who accompanied Kalonzo wereÂ Machakos deputy governor Francis Mwangangi, Kitui senator Enock Kiio, MPs Robert Basil, Edith Nyenze (Kitui), Charles Nguna, and several MCAs Nyenze congratulated Kalonzo for keeping Wiper leaders united. MP Nguna said Karua was a role model for women in the country. "We will do demonstrations as long as inflation is going up. The dollar has fallen. We have been promised a low cost of living but no promise is being implemented," the MP said. He called for Kenyans to come out for peaceful demonstrations when called by Azimio leaders. Nguna said the peaceful demonstrations were to agitate for better living standards. He said the value of a shilling had fallen against a dollar. Basil also said the cost of living has hit above the roof. "The price of unga is high. We have to remain strong and petition the government to lower the cost of living," he said. "If they have been defeated to run the government, we are ready to run it. Enough is enough, we must face the government. We will petition it through the ongoing demonstrations."
