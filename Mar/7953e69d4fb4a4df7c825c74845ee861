Lawyer Miguna Miguna now wants Azimio leader Raila Odinga to stop wasting his time holding rallies across the country. Miguna said Raila should instead shift his focus to oversighting President William Ruto's administration. He advised that the former Prime Minister should form a shadow Cabinet and have his strong men oversight key ministries. Miguna said this should continue as he prepares to run for office after Ruto is done with his second term. "Free advice to Raila Odinga and his dying army: Form a Shadow Cabinet with each appointee assigned to a specific ministry and department. Have them CHECK the Kenya Kwanza administration as you prepare for 2032. Stop wasting time with maandamano," he said. Miguna has not been on cordial terms with Raila since his handshake with retired President Uhuru Kenyatta. He has in many instances called out Raila's anti-government rallies. Raila resorted to holding opposition rallies across the country to protest the high cost of living and call for electoral reforms. He has since held over 10 rallies in different counties. The ODM leader also held a prayer rally at the Jeevanjee Gardens where he gave Ruto and 14-day ultimate to reduce the cost of living. Failure to do this, Raila said he will stage the 'mother of all demonstrations'.
