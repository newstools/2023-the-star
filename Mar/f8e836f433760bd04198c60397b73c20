County chief officers are authorised to delegate power and are answerable to the county executive committee member in their respective dockets. Their key functions include the day-to-day administration of departmental activities and the provision of strategic policy direction for effective service delivery within the departments they are assigned to. They also implement policies and programmes within departments. While county executive committee members are equivalent to Cabinet secretaries in the national government, chief officers are equivalent to permanent secretaries. The power to deploy a county public officer within a department is vested in the county chief officer.
