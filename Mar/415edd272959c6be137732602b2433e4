Vera Sidika has responded to a fan who claimed she had gotten rid of a pregnancy when she was dating Otile Brown. In her Q and A session on Instagram, she said there was no pregnancy. "How can you abort something that never existed? By the way, I would never do that. I love kids like crazy. I would have 10 if I could." Sidika is expecting her second child with husband Brown Mauzo. She recently revealed that it is a baby boy. "We didn't plan for the pregnancy, I found out four months later," she told a fan. "So I didn't have time to plan for a boy or a girl. But I prayed so hard for it to be a boy. I am just blessed." Sidika added that she didn't know the gender of their child earlier but discovered with everyone else. She and her husband had a chopper flying with the colour blue to show that the gender of their child is a boy.
