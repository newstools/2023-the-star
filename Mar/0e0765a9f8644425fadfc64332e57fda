Vihiga Queens are closing on on the signing of two Ugandan players, coach Boniface Nyamunyamu has revealed. The Kenya Women's Premier League defending champions have already roped in forward Bertha Omita and Dorcus Neema. The latter is a defender by trade. Nyamunyamu said the decision to recruit in the middle of the season has been necessitated by the mountingÂ  injury crisis at the club. Vihiga who have topped the league from match-day one, surrendered top spot to Gaspo after losing against them last weekend. "Omita and Neema will give us options. The club is in advanced negotiations with a striker and midfielder from neighboring Uganda. We might have them on board as early as Friday or weekend latest," Nyamunyamu said. He added: "Our levels have dropped because of the many injuries that has left the squad depleted. We don't want to find ourselves in a similar situation we had in the first leg. We lacked the bench power in the first half of the season and that disadvantaged us." The four-time WPL champions take on Kangemi Ladies on Saturday in Nairobi.
