The Under 18 category will feature nine girls and seven boys while the under 20 category, will have eight girls and six boys. AK youth and development chairman Barnaba Korir said they want to empower sprinters in the country and they have to start with the juniors. He said for the country to continue producing top sprinters, they have no choice but to increase their numbers, especially in the regional and continental events. "During the national trials at the Nyayo Stadium, we selected two athletes in each category in the short distance and had only one in each in mid and long-distance races," said Korir.
