PS State Department for Public Health and Professional Standards Dr Josephine Mburu has directed the Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority (KNRA) to map all radioactive material and sites in Kenya. The PS on Monday met with KNRA Acting director general James Chumba and board chairperson Peter Anyanga. The authority is tasked with ensuring the protection of occupationally exposed workers, patients undergoing medical radiation procedures, members of the public and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation, while at the same time ensuring that society enjoys optimal socio-economic benefits. The authority is then expected to recommend appropriate measures to be undertaken by the government to protect Kenyans from the harmful effects of the materials where there is a need. The PS called on the authority to be vigilant in the detection of harmful material in the environment and give necessary guidance to relevant agencies for appropriate action. The authority was further directed to carry out an inspection analysis of the Nairobi River and guide appropriately in the planned clean-up exercise of the river. President William Ruto has vowed to ensure that Nairobi county restores its lost glory. Ruto said his administration together with the Nairobi county government will take back the Nairobi River to its glorious days whereby the county will be made safe and healthy for everyone. “The unhealthy environmental situation must be corrected to restore Nairobi to its true identity,” he said. The Nairobi River Commission is part of Ruto's grand plan to clean up Nairobi city and restore it to its former glory. Years back, the Nairobi River water, from Lavington to Dandora, was clean and sparkling a few decades ago. It abounded with fish, water beetles, dragonflies and other creatures. Today, the Nairobi River is dead, or nearly so, and doesn't support life, except for scum and maggots.
