Minority leader Opiyo Wandayi has told off Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi over his decision to have an office for his spouse. Speaking on Friday, the Ugunja lawmaker said that such an office is a waste of public resources and a blatant betrayal of 'hustlers' who were allegedly hoodwinked to vote for the Kenya Kwanza government. "What we have seen happening with this regime is not acceptable. You saw them create the position of Prime Cabinet Secretary. They are now busy creating positions of Chief Administrative Secretaries," Wandayi pointed out. Last week, Mudavadi presided over the launch of the Office of The Spouse to the Prime Cabinet Secretary, to be occupied by his wife Tessie Shangatti Mudavadi. This attracted different reactions from politicians as well as Kenyans. Wandayi added that the positions are not recognized by the constitution or any other law. "It is shameful that somebody can wake up and imagine that he is creating the office of the Spouse to the Prime Cabinet Secretary. It is a  total loss of public money," he added. Wandayi spoke during the unveiling of an assistant chief's office and a Police post in Madungu, in Sigomere Ward, Ugunja The fiery opposition leader said that Mudavadi's spouse should stay away from public service for she has nothing to offer to suffering Kenyans. He argued that poor Kenyans are nowhere close to the government's opportunities because of hypocrisy; a testimony of betrayal of the hustlers by the President William Ruto-led regime. Wandayi threatened to raise the matter for debate in parliament and sponsor a court petition to force the abolishment of such positions.
