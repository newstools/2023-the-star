A high court in Zimbabwe has blocked the release of electronic voters' roll to the public citing national security concerns that would expose the document to manipulation. This follows a court case filed by opposition MP Allan Makharm after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) refused to give him a copy that he requested in October last year. The MP said the electronic copy was ideal for scrutiny as the printed version would be inconvenient and too expensive for him. However, the Harare High Court on Tuesday said the voters' roll was a sensitive document to be released to the public without addressing security concerns raised by Zec. The court said the electoral commission was mandated to protect the roll from manipulation and abuse. Zimbabwe is scheduled to hold general elections in July.
