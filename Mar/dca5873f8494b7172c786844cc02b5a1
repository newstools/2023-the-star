Nigerian superstar King Perry has released his long-anticipated EP, 'Continental Playlist'. This is a seven-song EP that affirms his ability to turn on a dime, going wherever inspiration and life leads. Perry spoke to Word Is about the inspiration for the EP. "Continental playlist', just as the name implies, is a carefully curated playlist of songs from the continental boy, myself, for my fans. The EP's title celebrates the 'continental sound', as I like to call it," he said. "My originality is Afro-dancehall and over the years, I have shown that I can fuse my sound with any other genre and make magic, so it felt like the right time to make this project. " "I plan on continuing the playlist, so there will be other volumes as time goes."
