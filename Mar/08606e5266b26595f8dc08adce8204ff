Interior CS Kithure Kindiki, has listed some of the achievements the government has made in a bid to flush out bandits in North Rift, so far. Speaking in a press conference on Thursday, Kindiki said so far, 140 weapons have been recovered. “Up to now, we have received over 140 weapons of various types. The amnesty which had been issued for three days lapsed and it will not be extended," Kindiki said. He added that the government’s operation to curb bandits in North Rift will succeed. “I can confirm to the country that we will get to the root of this problem of hurtless murders by bloodthirsty terrorists posing as cattle thieves. I can also confirm that the operation will succeed,” Kindiki said. “I can also confirm that all the illegal weapons which are in the hands of the criminals will be recovered. The government will recover all the illegal weapons that are in the hands of criminals." The security operation against bandits in six counties in the North Rift started in earnest on Friday, February 17. Kindiki declared the six counties in the North Rift as "disturbed and dangerous" following a wave of banditry that left several people, including security officers, dead. The move triggered massive security operations with the President ordering the deployment of KDF officers and other security forces to the areas. The counties include Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu counties. The bloody conflicts in these counties have existed for decades but previous efforts to curb them have always floundered.
