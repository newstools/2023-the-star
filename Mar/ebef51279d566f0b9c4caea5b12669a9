Ford Kenya officials in Kisii have opposed the proposal by UDA national secretary general Cleophas Malala that parties in the Kenya Kwanza alliance should fold and form one party. Nyanza region boss, Charles Mogaka termed Malala's behaviour hawkish, benighted and lacking political substance. Speaking in Kisii on Monday, Mogaka said the country has more pressing issues that need to be attended to than the folding parties. "Let him (Malala) know that we have heard him but he should stop any further push that we dissolve our parties, as Ford Kenya, we have rejected those overtures," Mogaka said. According to Malala, Kenya Kwanza constituent parties cannot continue in their current status and must dissolve and join the UDA. Malala was in ANC until a fortnight ago when he was picked to chair UDA. He said all these parties must be united under UDA as a demonstration of loyalty and support to the head of state. Mogaka described the proposal as mischievous and lacking merit. "If he asks for my advice, I will tell him that this is mischief at play, the country is faced with so many challenges already and dissolving parties isn't among them," Mogaka said. "The country is grappling with drought across the country and there is banditry in the North. "Here is a person telling us that we begin dismantling our parties. This is a lack of focus and priorities." Their party, he said, will remain independent and they will soon hold grassroots registration of new members to strengthen it.
