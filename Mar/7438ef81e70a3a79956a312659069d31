Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has assured Mt Kenya residents that key projects that stalled the last five years will be revived. Speaking when he met more than 350 professionals from Tetu constituency in Nairobi, Gachagua said the government is keen on fostering development in the region. The DP said issues that delayed the completion of the projects had been solved and contractors would be back on site soon. The DP said he had spoken with relevant authorities, the National Environment Management Authority and Kenya Wildlife Services, and cleared their concerns and the construction of the road would now resume. A key part of the Mau Mau Road, for instance, had been suspended in Tetu after environmentalists raised issues about the possible displacement of wildlife in areas it was to cut through. “The section of the road which had been delayed will be constructed as planned after we solved the issues,” he said on Friday. The professionals had pleaded with the DP to ensure the road was constructed saying it would open up Tetu to investors from the neighbouring constituencies. The DP also said the Kaigonji Water project will benefit the people of Tetu and Mathira and will be completed soon. The meeting was convened by Tetu MP Geoffrey Wandeto to brainstorm on the best ways to improve the lives of the constituents. The DP challenged the professionals to take back home their intellect and resources saying they were important for the development of the constituency. “The people are waiting for you to share what you have learnt, your experiences and skills to develop your areas,” he said. During the event, leaders from Tetu including renowned Dr Dan Gikonyo, former Chief of Kenya Defence Forces Julius Karangi, Dr Peter Muthoka, former area MP Nyammo, Nduhiu Njama, Anthony Muthungu and Grace Wairimu were recognised for their great service to the country. Freedom fighter and Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi, who hailed from the constituency, was also posthumously honoured.
