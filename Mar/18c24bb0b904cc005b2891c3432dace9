Uasin Gishu Governor Jonathan Bii will on Thursday hold a crisis meeting in regard to the Finland scholarship programme saga. Bii, through a letter, called on his County Executive Committee to the gathering to discuss the county-coordinated overseas education programme that has affected over 200 students. "Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has taken up the matter for investigations and auditors are also dealing with the matter," he said. Some of the students risk deportation from the country due to non-payment of fees, while others claimed to have been asked to vacate their hostels. The students include those at Tampere University who are 111, Jvaskyla University (25) and Laurea University (66). The programme was initiated and signed during the tenure of former Jackson Mandago as the governor of the county, to support students further their studies abroad. While speaking to the Star, Bii said the county acted as a guarantor as part of the requirement for visa applications. "In order to receive a visa to Finland, the students required six months accommodation, first semester fees, and proof of payment attached during visa applications," he said. In December 2022, Bii formed a  task force which was mandated to come up with recommendations on how to solve the students' crisis. “We have negotiated with universities for an extension of the fee due dates. We have also discussed and reminded the parents that payment of fees is their responsibility,” he said. The governor said the task force he formed has already engaged auditors to carry out a forensic audit on the trust fund accounts, even as he insists that the parents have an obligation to pay fees by March 31.
