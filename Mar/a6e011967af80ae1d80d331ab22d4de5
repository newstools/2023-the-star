Security officers in Homa Bay have started a manhunt for people who murdered a retired headteacher at Okela village in Kabondo Kasipul constituency. The body of Charles Ogweno Digo was found dumped near a footpath on Tuesday morning. Digo who is a resident of Agoro village in the neighbouring Kokwanyo location reportedly went missing after leaving home on Monday. He retired in 2021 when he was serving as the head teacher of Anding’o primary school in the Kokwanyo location. Residents said the 62-year-old teacher was seen last on Monday. Basa location Chief Tom Ondiro said the body was found with injuries which showed he was assaulted before being killed. The administrator said they suspected the man was also robbed of his money by the assailants. “He must have been assaulted before he died. The teacher must have also robbed of some money because his pockets were frisked and were inside out,” Ondiro said. Speaking over the matter on Wednesday, Homa Bay Criminal Investigations Officer Abed Kavoo said the teacher’s body was found with no shirt and shoes. The body was lying in a pool of blood and blood was oozing from his mouth. “There were some bruises on the body. We suspect the teacher was murdered elsewhere before the body was dumped,” Kavoo said. He said they had launched investigations into the matter and asked residents with information about the incident to report for the arrest of the suspect. Cases of murder are on the rise in Kabondo Kasipul and security officers want residents to report the suspects. “Our officers are on the ground to establish the truth about the incident. We’re also looking for suspects involved in the murder,” Kavoo added. He urged residents to cooperate with police in revealing information regarding the teacher’s death. The body was moved to Rachuonyo South Sub-county hospital mortuary in Oyugis town for postmortem.
