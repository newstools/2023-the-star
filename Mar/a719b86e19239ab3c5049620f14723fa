The Anti-Counterfeit Authority has returned goods worth Sh50 million to China Square after it was established they were not counterfeits. In a statement on Thursday, the authority said the complainant, Smithmo Company Ltd, withdrew the complaint after confirming that the 'Finder' branded goods were sourced from the same manufacturer and international brand owner. "We would like to inform the public that the complainant in a letter dated February 27, wrote to ACA and requested to withdraw the complaint against China Square.  "In light of this new information, ACA conducted a thorough investigation and verified the source of the goods and we can confirm that they are authentic Finder Tools. As such, we have released the goods to the rightful owner," ACA said. The goods were seized on February 16 after Smithmo made a complaint to the anti-counterfeit agency. The goods included hardware materials.
