A man who allegedly told his friend that he was in a position to help him reset his phone and later stole cash from his M-Pesa account has been charged with theft. Erick Simiyu was charged with stealing Sh25,000 before Kibera Senior Principal magistrate Esther Boke where he denied the charges. The court heard that the accused person was a close friend of Humphrey Makokha and he had allegedly mastered his Mpesa pin. He is said to have, on August 25 last year in Dagoretti Sub-county with others not before the court, stolen the said amount from the complainant's phone contrary to section 275 of the Penal code. The court heard that the complainant had complained that his phone had some problems and requested the services of the accused person who then allegedly stole the money. In court, the accused person denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh30,000 with the surety of the same amount. The case will be mentioned later this month for further directions.
