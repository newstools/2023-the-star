A new project to help Bungoma farmers add value to their produce has been launched. The National Value Chain Development Project aims to improve the value chains of crops such as potatoes, pyrethrum, coffee, bananas and cotton. It replaces the National Agriculture and Rural Inclusive Growth Project, whose five-year term has come to an end. NARIGP project was implemented by the government with support from the World Bank. Speaking during a farmers exhibition at Mabanga ATC, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka urged farmers to take advantage of the new project to change their lives. “We want farmers to add value to their produce to earn more and ensure food security. For example, one can make banana cakes and wine from bananas,” he said. NARIGP director Rebecca Lusweti urged farmers to embrace poultry farming to boost their income. Dairy farmer Rogers Koech said he has adopted technology to improve yields. He said Digicow Africa's app has helped him keep records of his cows. “Through the Digicow app, farmers can keep up to date records. The app is far better than the old method of keeping record files which can be misplaced,” Koech said.
