Daystar University Falcons' coach Caleb Bosire says he is proud of his charges for sealing a semi-final slot in KRU Championship on their debut. The Falcons are one game away from the top-tier league –Kenya Cup. They host former Kenya Cup side Kisumu RFC at Strathmore University grounds on Saturday In another semifinal, Nondescripts will be up against Diani-based South Coast Pirates at the Ngong Road Racecourse. Asked about the team’s chances of qualifying for the Kenya Cup, Bosire said: “I believe we have made it to the last four by pushing ourselves to the limit. We are at the tail end of the season and eager to see where this journey takes us.” The tactician added that the season has been good for his side. “We have taken one game at a time. The boys have pushed themselves to the limit to help us seal a home semi-final which we did on the last day of the regular season with a win over South Coast Pirates,” noted the coach. Daystar won the game 33-25. During the regular season, Daystar Falcons fought from 10-3 down at the break to upset Kisumu 21-13. Kisumu RFC secretary Jaycox Mwavali said: “We are traveling to Nairobi for a win. We lost to Daystar in the first game of the year because we were ill-prepared.” He added: “On paper, Daystar look favourites but statistically, we have a better defence than them. That is where the game will be won. We want to go for early points and then stretch them. Their defence is porous and we will take advantage of that,” added Mwavali. He said the team will travel for the encounter on Thursday so that they have enough rest. “We are also mobilizing our fans from across the country to travel for the game. The players need moral support.”
