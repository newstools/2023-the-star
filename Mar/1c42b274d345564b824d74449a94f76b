Former Mukurweini Member of Parliament Kabando wa Kabando has opined that President William Ruto is shaken. The politician said Aimio Chief Raila Odinga's resilience in his anti-government rallies has challenged Ruto's government. Kabando on Saturday said the President's administration is "scared stiff". "Ruto is shaken by Raila's resilience. Raila is a "guerrilla" swimming in masses, only upset self , handshake, BBI and Uhuru Deep State. Ruto's regime scared stiff, hence the paranoid bravado. Yet...."peace talks" loading? or a secret parley? So called "Hustler Nation" no longer at ease," he said. He said even though he recognises that Ruto is a legitimate president, he still supports Raila's rallies as he protests over the high cost of living. "I recognise Ruto as the constitutionally elected president, as I support Raila's oversight crusade to protest the rising costs of living through non-violent mass action. Ruto is turning even a disciplined National Youth Service Paramilitary Academy pass out parade to a ranting fora," he said. The ODM leader has led the Azimio coalition in anti-government protests since the beginning of the year. Raila has held anti-government rallies in Kamukunji and Jacaranda and Jeevanjee gardens in Nairobi. He has also held rallies in Machakos, Kisumu, Busia, Kisii and Kakamega. Despite the rallies, Ruto said he will remain unshaken and continue serving Kenyans. The opposition leader has called for mass action from next week if the President does not address key issues he raised.
