There are high-profile matches to look forward to this weekend in the Kenya Women's Premier League as the second leg begins. Ulinzi Starlets' tie with Zetech Sparks highlights the matches  as both teams scramble for points. The soldiers finished second last season  but they are already five points behind leaders Gaspo Women  after 11 matches. Ulinzi are fifth on the log with 19 points while Sparks, under coach Benard Kitolo, have mastered three loses, four wins and as many draws to sit ninth in the 12-team league. Gaspo rekindled their title hopes  by gunning down Vihiga Queens 2-0 at Mumias Sports Complex last weekend. Their date with giant killers Nakuru City Queens at Stima club looks tricky despite losing once thus far. Defending champions Vihiga will be expected to cruise past minnows Kangemi Ladies if the 9-0 first-leg demolition is any barometer. Vihiga fired blanks against Gaspo but the addition of experienced forward Bertha Omita and dependable defender Dorcus Neema will boost their title chances. Trans Nzoia Falcons will hope for a double over Thika Queens. Falcons beat the 2021 champions Thika 1-0 in the first leg but their resilience will be tested at Thika stadium. Kisumu All Starlets host Bunyore Starlets at Moi Stadium Kisumu while  Mumias based Wadadia travel to face lowly-ranked Kayole Starlets.
