The high court in Machakos has temporarily stopped the Kajiado county assembly from impeaching two county executives. This is after a petitioner, Henry Shitanda, sought the indulgence of the court in stopping the MCAs from implementing the process of impeaching two using an amended Standing Order No 62. Shitanda, through lawyer Kelvin Michuki, argued that on February 16, the county assembly, under the leadership of the speaker amended standing order 62 of the rules without following the process laid down under its standing orders. He argued that the orders sought in the interim ought to be granted for the reason that the application and the petition will be rendered nugatory if the same is not granted as the respondent (Kajiado county assembly) will continue with the discussion based on standing order No 62. Seeker Justus Ngossor is listed in the petition as the first respondent, county assembly as second and assembly clerk as 3rd. Justice Royala Olel, sitting in Machakos, granted the suspension of the implementation of the amendment of standing order No 62 and certified as urgent the application by Shitanda. Olel said that pending the hearing of the application he granted conservatory order suspending the implementation of the amendment and fixed the hearing for March 21.
