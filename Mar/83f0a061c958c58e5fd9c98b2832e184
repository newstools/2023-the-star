Michael Karanga and Naomi Wafula are among Kenya pros expected at this weekend's Windsor Classic, the second leg of Kenya Amateur Golf Championships (KAGC) series. Karanga will be on the course to defend his title from last year in a tournament that will have a mixture of both professional golfers and Kenyan ladies. In a statement from the Kenya Golf Union (KGU) vice chairman Philip Ochola said that, for the first time, the three categories will feature in the same tournament — set for Friday through Sunday. “As a first, the professional golfers will be participating in the event in addition to lady golfers. The professionals will, however, compete for a different prize purse,” read part of the communique from Ochola, who is also the tournament director. He said the Windsor Classic, run under the new R&A rules, will see a participating amateur win cash prizes limited to a maximum of $1000 (Sh127,000) per event. “A cash purse of Sh500,000 has been set aside for the top 20 amateurs based on the results over three days of 18 holes each. A cut for the top 48 amateurs and top 12 professionals will be applied after two rounds,” added Ochola. Kiambu-based Karanga will lead the amateurs after winning the opening round at Sigona — the Sigona Bowl. Karanga expects tough battle from John Lejirma of Kenya Railways. After representing the country at the Magical Kenya Ladies Open, Wafula will lead fellow ladies Joyce Wanjiru and Channelle Wangari in the hunt for glory.
