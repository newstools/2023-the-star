Political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi has asked President William Ruto to reach out to Azimio's leader and have a private discussion. In a statement on Tuesday, Ngunyi said that the President should not push Raila's limits. "Dear Ruto. Are you sure you know how to handle Raila Odinga? Fuel is up, but you are giving him political fuel for free. Do not push his limits. Use lollypop diplomacy. Open DCI gates. Give him some whisky in a private waiting room. Be friendly," he said. The opposition chief has been leading a series of anti-government rallies countrywide. Raila has held anti-government rallies in Kamukunji and Jacaranda and Jevanjee gardens in Nairobi. He has also held rallies in Machakos, Kisumu, Busia, Kisii and Kakamega. Despite the rallies, Ruto said he will remain unshaken and continue serving Kenyans. The opposition leader has called for mass action from next week if the President does not address key issues he raised. Raila had given the president a 14-day ultimatum to address his concerns. Last Sunday, the ODM leader asked his supporters to troop to Nairobi for the peaceful demonstration, setting the stage for a confrontation with the police. “I want all of you (supporters in Kitale) to come to Nairobi and join us for the peaceful demonstrations,” he said, briefing the supporters on the song they’d sing as they march to a destination he is yet to disclose. With Raila keen to box Ruto into a corner, the President has to make a tactical balance between keeping the country stable and at the same time countering the opposition.
