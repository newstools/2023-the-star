Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma says he has been receiving threats after he intends to table a Bill before the National Assembly to increase the severity of the penalty for homosexual offenders. Speaking on Wednesday, Kaluma said that he will still stand firm because most of his bills concerning family have been passed. "I want to tell the people imagining we can withdraw (LGBTQ bill) because I have been receiving threats telling me Kaluma withdraw from that enterprise. I am telling them to study my history with matters concerning the family," he said. Kaluma said that youths are being recruited from as low as Sh500 to engage in homosexuality. "This thing (homosexuality) is in all government offices, in parliament and in media. This thing is percolating all over. This comes in the midst of a national debate following the Supreme Court's ruling to allow the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC) to be registered as a legal NGO. The court ruled that although homosexuality is illegal in Kenya, it cannot deny the community the right to association. The MP said the proposed law is intended to protect the family unit with the proposed hefty penalties geared towards discouraging the practice. “It will not only consolidate existing laws relating to unnatural sexual acts but also increase the penalty for those convicted of engaging or promoting the acts to life imprisonment,” he stated. Atheists have come out to protest the proposal by MP Kaluma saying the legislator should instead promote human rights. Kaluma has since maintained that homosexuals should be punished because it is illegal in Kenya.
