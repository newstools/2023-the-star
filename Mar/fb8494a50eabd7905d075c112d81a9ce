A lobby is pushing to have essential food items exempted from taxes to cushion Kenyans from the rising cost of living. Among the items they want to be zero-rated include maize and wheat flour, cooking oil, cooking gas, bread and milk. The group, the Public Service Governance said the 'Affordable Kitchen Bill' which is in the public participation stage seeks to bring the cost of food down and ensure no Kenyan sleeps hungry. The organization's President Esther Waringa said they will lobby parliamentarians to support the bill. Speaking during the launch of an organisation for single mother in Nairobi, yesterday, Waringa said Kenyans can hardly put food. "We hope the Parliamentarians will stand with the electorate and pass the bill to make the cost of food affordable. We also call on President William Ruto to assent to the bill if it is passed by parliament,"  Waringa said. The single mothers led by their chairperson Elizabeth Wambui decried how life has been unbearable over the past few months. "Other than being unable to afford food on a daily basis, our children have dropped out of school because we don’t get any support and most of us are jobless," Wambui said. The women said they needed more recognition and support programmes from both national and county governments.
