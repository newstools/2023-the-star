Police have arrested one spiritual leader who has been allegedly providing prophetic support to bandits in  North Rift regions. In a statement on Sunday, Interior CS Kithure Kindiki said following the arrest, the government shall also give out monetary rewards in exchange for information to capture the bandits. "Already, one of them, a spiritual leader who has been providing prophetic support to the bandits has been apprehended," the statement read. "The Government shall offer significant monetary rewards to any member(s) of the public who give us information that leads to the successful arrest of these dangerous elements." Kindiki said police have identified a number of leaders in charge of bandits and threatened to mention their names. "In a short while, we shall be circulating the names and photographs of these desk pillars of the evil network that is banditry," the CS said. He said that bandits have continued to kill innocent civillians in North Rift regions despite  warnings from the government. Kindiki said bandits have attempted to attack security officers and their equipment. "By trying to demonstrate that they can disrupt an ongoing operation and that they can withstand our firepower, these thugs have invited the government to take the war to their hideouts in remote forests, caves, ravines, gorges and escarpments," he said. The CS ordered residents living in areas prone to banditry to vacate by Monday, March 13. He said security agencies have been undertaking intelligence gathering to establish the nature bandits are using to operate.
