A gang of four on Saturday morning robbed a Sacco branch in Murang'a County of an unknown amount of money. The gang struck the Unaitas Sacco branch and got away with millions of shillings, and a loaded rifle they dispossessed a police officer manning the premises, police said. Police are pursuing the gang that escaped using a motorcycle and a small car after the 9 am incident. One person was injured after the thugs opened fire to clear their escape mission. Officials suspect the gang stole between Sh3.5 million and Sh5 million. “That is the rough amount the beach usually has. We suspect an inside job,” said an insider. Police said the gang had arrived disguised as guards before they attacked the officers on duty and stole his gun. This was after they hit him with a metal rod on the head. This comes a few days after another gang attacked two police officers who were manning a roadblock and disarmed one of them. On February 25, the gang accosted the two police officers near Njora Secondary School gates and after beating them, escaped with a loaded AK47 rifle. The rifle is yet to be recovered. Kigumo MP Joseph Munyoro protested the incident saying he is gravely concerned that the same has occurred after an officer was attacked this morning in Mununga and his loaded gun stolen. “A civilian has also been shot in the incidence. I have contacted security heads and an operation in pursuit of the six criminals. Who will protect the residents if even the police are not safe?” Posed the MP. He said this clearly indicates there are major security gaps that need to be addressed urgently. “I will also be raising this matter in parliament for clear answers on the way forward from the Ministry of Interior.”
