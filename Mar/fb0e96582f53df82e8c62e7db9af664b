Trail Blazers volleyball team came from two sets down to beat Equity Bank 3-2 on Sunday in the Kenya Volleyball Federation league match at the Nyayo Stadium. The Ruaraka-based side seemed headed for defeat after going down 25-21 and 29-27 in the opening two sets before changing the tide. Coached by Geoffrey Omondi, Trail Blazers were sloppy both in defence and offence. In the first set, Trail Blazers recorded 10 points from attack, managed zero points in both blocks and service but registered 11 points from opposition errors. On their part, Equity recorded 11 points on the attack and successfully registered three points each from blocks and service while eight points came from errors. The trend continued in the second set but it was a neck-to-neck affair. The two sides tied at 14-14, 16-16, 19-19, 24-24, and 25-25 but a lapse in concentration saw Trail Blazers lose 29-27. The introduction of Rwandeese setter Jean Claude Masezerano injected belief into the Blazers' team. The re-introduction of Juliard Mbappe in the third set changed the tempo for Blazers. He attacked with precision and his coordination with Reagan Omondi, David Neeke and Bundotich Obadiah bore fruits. They won 25-23 to make it 2-1. The bankers dropped their levels and the Blazers tore their defence apart in the fourth set, winningÂ  25-21. Trail Blazers prevailed in the decider 15-11 to send the fully packed Nyayo gymnasium crowd into a frenzy.
