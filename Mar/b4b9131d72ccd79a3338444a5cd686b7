Rarienda MP Otiende Amollo has rubbished a section of Luo elders who installed President William Ruto as the community's elder. The MP termed such elders a cultural prostitutes who should be dealt with by the community's leadership. Speaking on Saturday during the burial of Luo Council of Elders chairman Ker Wilis Opiyo Otondi, Otiende said the community cannot be up for auction by errant elders. “The people who purported to install William Ruto a Luo elder are called as cultural prostitutes and must be dealt with by the community,” Otiende said. “I have been the Luo Council of Elders for 18 years and I know that the legitimate council chairman was Otondi.” When President Ruto toured Luo Nyanza in January he was crowned as a Luo elder in Asembo, Rarieda constituency in Siaya County. This was during the homecoming ceremony of ICT Cabinet Secretary Honourable Eliud Owalo. Ruto was given a traditional headgear, a bow, a spear and was dressed in a clothe made of an animal's skin. He was crowned as Luo elder as he sat on a stool and after that and was pictured while holding spear and the bow. Ruto's installation was presided over by the chairman of Luo splinter group or a faction Nayndiko Ongadi. In a another political punch at Ruto, Otiende warned rebels from the region who have been trooping to State House ostensibly for development projects. “Those are called political prostitutes and should be told as such,” he said. A section of ODM MPs from Luo Nyanza has warmed up to Ruto's administration, saying they will work with the national government for the sake of development.
