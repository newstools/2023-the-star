Ex-Selina actor Lenana Kariba says he wants his children to study in the UK. Lenana and his mzungu wife Helen are expectant with their first child. Speaking in a recent Q and A session with fans on Instagram, the father-to-be shared their experience and hopes for their unborn child. Helen is due in May, according to details shared by her famous husband. "We won't do a gender reveal thing, but we will reveal the gender of our child in the next week," he said. "We had our baby shower on Saturday, which was awesome to be able to celebrate with the family, but we missed Helen's parents though." Lenana said his wife has been craving for apples and mangoes. A fan sort to know where the couple would want their child to school. Lenana said they want to try and make sure they get to experience life in both countries, Kenya and the UK. "We will continue to travel back and forth. School, we plan to do in the UK, but then every holiday, we will fly out. I need my parents to teach them Kikuyu," he said. Some of the tough things his wife is experiencing as a pregnant mum is bad morning, all-day sickness and weight gain, which he says has made her unhappy. "Swollen ankles and feet, bad heart burn, and she is super tired," he shared, adding that their child will be born in London. He said he is ready to give fatherhood his all and be very hands on to give his little one the best he possibly can. The 'Selina' actor and his wife got married at a surprise ceremony in 2021. They said 'I do' in the Caribbean island of Antigua. He dropped pictures in a cosy moment with his wife Helen thereafter. He captioned that they wed on August 11, 2021, adding a heart emoji with the words 'Forever'. The two met at a friend's house in Kileleshwa at a birthday party. "We met here in Nairobi, actually. She was born in the UK but she was raised between Kenya and the UK. I met her here. We both have a mutual friend, but we had never met. I know this guy," he said.
