Shabana are expected to hand debuts to new signings goalkeeper Erick Ongiri, and defenders George Onyango and Eric Mtoro. Midfielder Maurice Dukully is also likely to be handed a second debut at the club after signing from Kenya Premier League side, Talanta.

We have picked important lessons from today’s game,” said Ochieng. His Mombasa Elite counterpart Patrick Nyale, said: “It was a tough game against a very good team.
