Socialite Amber Ray and her boyfriend Kennedy Rapudo have fuelled break-up reports on social media. This is despite allegations that they are expecting their first child together. The two unfollowed each other on Instagram. Amber has further deleted photos of the family they had taken over Christmas as well as photos of a vacation with Rapudo she had posted lately on her timeline. The two have not addressed the matter with fans. Rapudo deleted Amber's photos as he also shared a cryptic message on his Instagram stories. He talked about letting go of things that may hurt you more if you keep holding on to them. "Sometimes holding on does more damage than letting go," he said. The two had moved into a new house just a few months ago with their blended family: Kennedy and his daughter and Amber Ray and her son. This is not the first time the two have broken up. In September, Amber broke up with Rapudo over "structural irreconcilable differences". The two patched things a month later after Rapudo apologised with a thousand roses.
