Siaya Senator Oburu Odinga has claimed that Members of Parliament who visited President William Ruto at State House last month went for personal gains. Oburu spoke on Saturday during the burial ceremony of Luo elder Ker Willis Opiyo Otondi in Kisumu. "There are no development discussions at State House, if they want more money allocation in their constituencies, they should go to Parliament, not State House, laws are passed in Parliament," he said. In February, ODM said they had received a deregistration request from the party for the MPs who visited State House. ODM party secretary general Edwin Sifuna said that mechanisms have been initiated for action. "The office is in receipt of your letter whose contents we acknowledge. Internal mechanisms have been initiated with a view of processing it for action by the relevant party organs in accordance with the party constitution and any other relevant law," Sifuna said. This is afterÂ Migori Senator Eddy Oketch wrote to the party to expel and deregister the nine lawmakers. In a letter addressed to the party's secretary general and disciplinary committee, Oketch through his lawyer Gad Aguko claimed the MPs violated the party's constitution. "We act for Senator Eddy Oketch Migori county and a life member of ODM on whose instructions we address you as hereunder. On February 7, the members of the party were treated to blatant and arrogant violation of the party's Constitution as read together with Section 14A (1) (e) of the Political Parties Act No. 11 of 2012 of the Laws of Kenya by the above mentioned Party Members," the letter read.
