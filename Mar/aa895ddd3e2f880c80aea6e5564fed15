Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has claimed that billions of shillings were stolen from the public coffers in the last days of retired President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration. The DP sensationally alleged that top officials in Uhuru's government looted a total of Sh16 billion from the National Treasury before President William Ruto was sworn in. He claimed that Sh10 billion was stolen during the Presidential election petition while a further 6 billion was taken away just two days before the August 9 general election. “Two days before the elections, they stole Sh6 billion and pretended to sell some shares from Telkom. When there was a case before the Supreme Court, they stole another Sh10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors,” he said. Gachagua spoke on Friday evening at a Nairobi Hotel where he attended a high-profile meeting with professionals from Nyeri County. “Money was being brought in cartons at Wilson Airport and flown in choppers to people's homes. And these are the people now unasikia wanaambiwa kuja andika statement kidogo, anaingia ndege anatoroka. And these people, who are thieves, were calling others thieves. They ripped this country…. They took everything,” Gachagua said. The DP said the current sorry state of the country's economy was trigered by the former government's wanton looting of public funds. “I said during my inauguration about the country we inherited... some people thought I was being mischievous. We inherited a dilapidated country, the coffers were empty, the stores were empty, not even rats were there because there was nothing to eat,” he said. “We have started building this country from scratch. All the good work that President Mwai Kibaki did in 10 years was totally destroyed. All the good work Kibaki did of building a strong economy, of having thriving businesses, of allowing people to trade freely, of making sure there is money circulating in the economy, all of it was destroyed especially during the handshake era.”
