Roads Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has rejected a Bill proposing to assign additional functions to National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) to streamline the boda boda industry. In a presentation made to the Transport Committee by Principal Secretary Mohamed Daghar, Murkomen said his ministry does not support proposed amendments to the NTSA Act No. 33 of 2012 through National Assembly Bill No. 43 of 2022. The Bill, sponsored by Ruiru MP Simon King’ara, seeks to establish systems and procedures for registering and licensing tuk tuks and boda bodas. Murkomen said registration of motorcycles by region is not the best way to go. “Should the national government register motorcycles by regions, it is unclear what would happen to the registration once the motorcycle is disposed to another third of fourth owners who resides in different regions,” he explained. All motorcycles are registered when imported or assembled and are issued with a registration number under the name of the dealer or assembler. It is when they are sold that the dealer transfers to the buyer as the owner. “By the time this is being done, the registration has already been concluded and the issue at hand is the transfer. Therefore, regional registration would be impractical,” Murkomen said. He added that motorcycles that operate within the county is a function of the county governments. “The national government cannot take over unless the Constitution is amended.” The NTSA (operation of motorcycles) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 provide for the licensing of motorcycle taxis by the county governments. Murkomen further noted that once a rider is issued a riding license, the document is applicable nationwide and not regionally. “Under the UN Convention of Road Traffic 1968 to which Kenya is a party, the law provides for the recognition of national and not regional licenses,” the CS noted.
