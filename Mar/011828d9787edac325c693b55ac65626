Former Kenya Lionesses coach Ronny Owino has tipped national and regional schools champions Kaya Tiwi to retain their crown. Speaking in Mombasa during a First coach-sponsored coaching course at the Makande Welfare hall, Owino said the side remains very much the team to beat. The Kwale county-based Kaya Tiwi girls impressed the coaches during the course on Sunday. The three-day clinic attracted 68 local coaches. "They have good players in all departments. From the point guard to shooting guard to forwards and post players, the team is good," offered Owino. "The knowledge they got during that clinic will make them a better team. The way I saw them, they should have no problems at all." Owino, who is also Strathmore University coach, identified key players as point guards —Wendy Atieno and Hilda Nyokabi. The others who will also play key roles are post-players Mariam Wangare, Roseline Akinyi and Angeline Adhiambo. The same sentiments were echoed by the First coach regional technical director,  Everlyne Kedogo who alongside Owino and Carey Oketch also handled the girls during the clinic. "The team has a good chance. They have great potential and they really understand the game. Though I've not visited many schools, they have some good players and will go far." Team coach Philip Onyango said they are set for the games that start tomorrow at the sub-county level before moving to the county level next week. "We have trained well and the Sunday course added so much to what we already know. We are ready to come Friday," Said Onyango. The team also got a huge boost after getting shoes and sets of playing kits donated by reigning national women champions Kenya Ports Authority."
