Ogaga defended the students saying they got angry with the parents because they were interfering with learning in the school He said the students also caned some two parents who remained behind in the school after others left. Rachuonyo North sub-county police commander Lydia Parteiyie said the three arrested will be arraigned. “The school parents’ association chairman was arrested because he is accused of being the ring leader in the raid. We’ll charge him in court together with his two colleagues,” Parteiyie said. The police officers said it is wrong to breach the peace in school and urged parents to stop taking the law into their hands. “They should follow due channel when they have grievances,” she added. Three people have been arrested following the Thursday fracas which occurred between students and parents at Otok Mixed Secondary School in Karachuonyo constituency. The school parents association chairman Joshua Ochieng and two other unnamed people are currently being detained at Kendu Bay police station. Their arrest came after they were linked to the chaos which erupted when a group of parents raided and attack a newly posted head teacher in the school. In the incident, the mob invaded the school with intention of ejecting the new principal. During the fracas, it is reported that the parents assaulted the school deputy principal with stones as he was trying to intervene. He sustained injuries on the head. After the attack on the teachers, students got involved and began fighting the parents by hurling stones at the parents and chasing them out of school. The parents were chased about two kilometres away from the school. Speaking on Friday after the incident, the school principal Jackton Ogaga said he does not know why the parents do not want him in the school. “The parents first hurled insults at me before they stormed the school. The students came out of classrooms when they started assaulting me and chase them away,” Ogaga said.
