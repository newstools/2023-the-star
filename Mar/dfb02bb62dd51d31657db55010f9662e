FIFA president Gianni Infantino has had an investigation against him related to a private jet being chartered to fly from Suriname to Switzerland in 2017 closed by a Swiss Court. FIFA welcomed the decision by the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG) on Thursday - one week ahead of the FIFA presidential elections where Infantino is due to stand unopposed for re-election at its Congress on March 16 in Rwanda’s capital Kigali. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, FIFA said: “FIFA welcomes the decision of the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG), which has closed the investigation against FIFA President Gianni Infantino related to a private jet being chartered to fly from Suriname to Switzerland in 2017.” “It has been confirmed that the travel arrangements, made by the President’s Office and FIFA’s travel department, were in line with FIFA’s compliance rules and regulations - a decision that is in line with the ruling of FIFA Ethics Committee in August 2020 on this case. In addition, the OAG has acknowledged that the manner of communication in relation to these travel arrangements at the time were completely justified.” Following the OAG’s judgment, the Swiss state shall bear all costs related to the investigation, while the FIFA President has also decided to waive any claim for damages, thus foregoing any potential compensation.” “Since the start of proceedings, the FIFA President has been fully at the disposal of the Swiss authorities and remains hopeful that the judicial system recognises that the current FIFA administration has turned the page on the past and is now established as a credible and respected organisation.” FIFA’s Ethics Committee closed its investigation into the case in August 2020, due to “the evident lack of a prima facie case regarding any alleged breach of the FIFA code of ethics.”
