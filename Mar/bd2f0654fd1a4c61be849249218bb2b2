The High Court is expected to deliver a judgment today in the petition challenging the election of Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi. The petition was lodged by Abdullahi's rival Adan Mohamed Hassan who came second during the August 9, 2022 election. Hassan, who is the former National Hospital Insurance Fund CEO, sought the nullification of Abdullahi's election on grounds that there were gross discrepancies in Form 37A returns. He alleges that the total votes cast in some polling stations were more than the total voter turnout captured by the Kenya Integrated Management System (KIEMS) kits. Abdullahi has denied the claims and defended his win. Justice George Dulu, sitting at the Milimani law courts in Nairobi, is expected to deliver the judgment after hearing the case. Elsewhere, police sergeant Ahmed Rashid will today know whether he will be charged with murder following accusations of killings of Jamal Mohammed and Mohamed Dihir in Eastleigh, Nairobi in 2017. The Independent Police Oversight Authority had recommended that Rashid be charged with murder in the extra-judicial killings case. However, the cop moved to court to block his prosecution, saying it was an abuse of the court process. Justice Kanyi Kimondo last month deferred the plea-taking pending the determination of Rashid's case. That determination is due to be made today. The state had asked the court to dismiss Rashid's case against his prosecution. Rashid's plea-taking has been adjourned on three occasions.Â  The first time was on December 8, 2022, when the plea-taking was pushed to January 26, 2023. On that day, the officer failed to appear in court physically and joined the court using a virtual platform. The plea-taking also failed to happen because the officer had not been subject to a mental assessment to confirm he is fit for trial.
