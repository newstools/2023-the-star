EALA MP Suleiman Shahbal now says that the social media platform, Instagram, is trying to force gay issues on Kenyans. In a statement on Wednesday, Shahbal said it is a sad affair as he called on Kenyans to protect their children. "Over the weekend, I voiced my concerns about LGBTQ and posted a video on my Instagram page. Alas! I received a notification that the video has been removed. They are forcing gay values down our throats whether we like it or not. This is sad! Let's protect our children," he said. In the video that has since been pulled down by the social platform, the legislator had called on Kenyans to rally against gays. He said if allowed to thrive, Kenya risked destroying a whole generation. "Let’s stand firm to fight the LGBTQ menace. We have a whole generation that would be ruined if we do not oppose this issue. Say no to LGBTQ." LGBTQ has been a hot topic in Kenya after the Supreme Court allowed the to form a Gay rights organisation. The ongoing debate about the same has also seen top political leaders declare a firm stand against the practice. President William Ruto has said he will not allow the country to head in that direction as Kenya has values that need to be respected. “We respect the Court but… I will not allow it in Kenya. We have our culture and traditions, we respect our constitution and all our religions,” he said. "We can’t travel the road of women marrying women or men marrying men. That will not happen under my watch,” he added. Raila said the Constitution of Kenya does not allow same-sex marriages. He quoted Article 45 (2) which states: "Every adult has the right to marry a person of the opposite sex, based on the free consent of the parties." "Opposite sex ya kwamba jinsia tofauti. Hiyo ndiyo katiba (Opposite sex meaning different genders. That is the Constitution)," he emphasised.
