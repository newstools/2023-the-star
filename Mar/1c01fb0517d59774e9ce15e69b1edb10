Bunyore Starlets will miss the services of Irene Madalina and Almasi Naomi for their away trip to Nakuru City Queens this weekend. Coach Absalom Mariga said the pair are injured and unavailable for selection. "It is unfortunate that Madalina and Naomi won't be part of the team to face Nakuru. The duo have been struggling with knee injuries. We hope they will be fit for the second leg," Mariga. Bunyore are fifth on the 12-team log with 16 points from 10 matches. Nakuru has 17 points to occupy the fourth position. Mariga, a former Vihiga United player added that the team had to adjust their style of play after last season's dismal show in the top-flight. "The style of play was the biggest problem last season. We have taken a tactical approach this time round.  The results are evident if our ranking on the log is anything to go by." "We bolstered our squad with better signings  and we have managed to adjust according to the opponent this season. Our only  major undoing is finances." Mariga said they will unveil their new signings next week. "We have signed five new players that will be revealed to the media next week. It will be unfair to mention names now," he said.
