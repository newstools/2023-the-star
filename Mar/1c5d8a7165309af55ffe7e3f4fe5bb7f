Simon Berghan, Scott Cumming, Rory Darge and Stafford McDowall have been added to the Scotland squad for Sunday's Six Nations Test with Ireland. Josh Bayliss and the suspended Grant Gilchrist will return to their clubs. Gilchrist was red-carded in the defeat by France and is banned for the rest of the championship and Edinburgh's match with Connacht. Scotland have two wins from three matches, while Ireland have a 100% record.
