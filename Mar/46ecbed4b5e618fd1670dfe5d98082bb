Beach Volleyball Commission secretary Sammy Mulinge wants Kenya Volleyball Federation to postpone this weekend's women's league matches. The National Olympic Committee of Kenya will be hosting their first-ever beach games on March 18-19 at BuntwaniÂ  Waterfront Park, Malindi and Mulinge feels the two tournaments will crash. "It will be better if the women's league matches are postponed. We need to respect NOC-K programs. It is not a must that we shelve the league matches but that is my humble appeal to KVF," Mulinge said. "Most of the players that play conventional volleyball are also involved in beach volleyball. We would like to see our best beach players grace the occasion." More than 15 beach competitions and popular local beach games will take place during the two-day show. Aquathlon, basketball 3x3, judo, boxing, wrestling, taekwondo, beach handball, football, tennis, volleyball 4x4, coastal rowing, freestyle football, karate kata, kiteboarding, and open-water swimming are among the sports enlisted. Mulinge said eight teams per gender will take part in the competition. A team needs to produce four players while they are also encouraged to have their own coaches. "The clubs are aware of what is required of them. Nock has given the federation mandate to do everything," he concluded.
