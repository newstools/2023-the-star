Chief Justice Martha Koome will Thursday admit a total of 466 lawyers to the Roll of Advocates. The ceremony to be held at the Supreme Court grounds happens exactly three months after another lot of 358 were admitted. Admission to the bar is a process that marks the transition of learning to practicing law. To be admitted, one must undertake the advocates training programme (ATP), a postgraduate diploma in law that is only offered by the Kenya school of law (KSL). For several years, there have been cases of students sitting the bar exams failing. In 2019, 36 percent passed the test while in 2018 only 18 percent of the students that sat the exam passed. Late last year, a petitioner moved to Court seeking to have the High Court declare section 16 of the KSL Act null and void. Lawyer Francis Njoroge argued that KSL is overwhelmed and cannot cater for the over 3,000 students undertaking the ATP. Njoroge wanted the monopoly of KSL of offering diploma courses before one is admitted stripped. â€œThe Council of Legal Education has failed to issue or develop the regulatory framework and standards for licensing other legal education providers (in addition to the Kenya School of Law) to offer a postgraduate diploma (Advocates Training Programme)," Njoroge said in his petition. "I verily believe that this constitutes a breach of its obligation to set and enforce standards relating to the accreditation of legal education providers for licensing under section 8(2)(a) of the Legal Education Act, 2012."
