Public Policy Analyst Abdullahi Alas, has said the problem that ail Kenya is greed. Speaking in an interview on Wednesday, Alas said Kenya is not progressing due to lack of character, ideals and values that have not been developed for a very long time. “The problem we have in this country is greed and public theft. Those cannot be cured by the law. Regardless of which ones you bring," Alas said. "You cannot cover greed by law. You cannot cure or change people who want to misappropriate public funds by strengthening the law. They will still steal. “What we have is a culture of the elite that was developed.” He added that regardless of Kenyans being Christians and Muslims, there are still cases of thefts. “83 per cent of this country are Christians, we read the bible, we confess to Jesus, we go to church, Muslims go to the mosque. In Northern Kenya, we don’t have a Christian as a governor, who is stealing from them? Who are the guys building houses in South C, go to Utawala and Syokimau?” Alas said. “It is a culture of greed where people value big cars, big houses.”
