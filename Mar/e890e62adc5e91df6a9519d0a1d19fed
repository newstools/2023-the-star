Nakuru Governor Susan Kihika has said there's absolutely no chance that President William Ruto will yield to pressure and enter a truce with Azimio leader Raila Odinga. In a statement on Monday, Kihika questioned the rationale of holding elections if those who lose resort to agitating for a share of government every election cycle. "What is the point of elections if every cycle the loser demands to forcefully be incorporated into government?" Kihika posed. Raila has called for mass action from March 20 to force the Kenya Kwanza government to act and lower the cost of living and implement electoral reforms. The Azimio leader who lost the August 9 presidential contest to President William Ruto has stated severally that the call for defiance against the government is not meant to pressure him into a handshake. But Ruto's allies have held that a handshake is Raila's ultimate target and have categorically told him to hold his horses until 2027 and let Ruto deliver his campaign pledges to the electorate. "Doesn’t the election determine the winner - President; the loser goes home and waits for the next election hoping for better luck to legitimately turn tables and win?" Kihika asked. The governor was challenged by a user in the comment section over the 'user takes all' electoral system which Raila sought to rectify through the failed Building Bridges Initiative. "Yes! That’s our system you go into elections knowing that," Kihika said. The governor was further challenged to say if, in her opinion, there is any likelihood that Ruto may agree to a handshake with Raila. "I was taught never say never but on this one I will go out on a limb and say NOPE!!"
