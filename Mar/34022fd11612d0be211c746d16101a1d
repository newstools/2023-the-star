Legislators now want the government to fully place students in public universities before sending some to private instructions. In a report, the public Investments Committee on Education and Governance proposed a review of this funding policy. “Review the policy since the capacity gap between slots available in public universities vis a vis qualified students is now non-existent,” Wanami Wamboka said. Wamboka who is the committee chair further noted that the objectives of private varsities differ from that of other national institutions. The Bumula MP explained that most private universities are profit-making entities. “Objectives of private universities may be at variance with national development goals as they are first and foremost profit-centric,” he said. Wamboka now wants an amendment to the Universities Act and the Helb Act. This, he said will give public universities first priority to fill up their slots to 100 percent. “This will be before a student is financed through capitation, in a private entity. Students who willingly choose private education must surely be capable of funding the same,” he added. Recent data from the Universities Fund shows the State currently pays for 20.79 percent of the unit costs for government-sponsored students in private universities and 48.11 percent of those in public universities. The United States International University stopped admitting government-sponsored students due to underfunding. Strathmore University is the other high-profile private university that also stopped admitting State-sponsored students. Mount Kenya University, Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA) and Daystar University are among the private universities that admit government-sponsored students.
