Health CS Susan Nakhumicha has reiterated the government's commitment to implement the 2017-2021 Collective Bargaining Agreement with doctors. This followed a meeting with county and doctors' representatives on Wednesday. "Dr Nakhumicha S. Wafula, the CS for Health, emphasized the government's commitment to improving the healthcare sector in Kenya. The government is committed to ensuring that healthcare workers are well-compensated & motivated to provide quality services to Kenyans," the ministry said. It also committed to having some 300 intern doctors posted by April. The implementation of the 2017-2021 CBA has been an issue of contention between KMPDU and the government. Doctors have been threatening to go on strike over delays in its implementation. The meeting also provided an opportunity for all stakeholders to assess the progress made so far and identify areas that need improvement. Ministry of Health representatives, Council of Governors, Ministry of Labour, Treasury, SRC, Public Service Commission, Department of Public Service, and Central Organisation of Trade Union officials were also present. Earlier, KMPDU hadÂ faulted the government for failing to invest in healthcare, by failing to honour the CBA. Secretary general Davji Atellah said the situation in the country was because of the people put in charge of healthcare in the country. He said these individuals don't use the health facilities in the country and wouldn't know the challenges faced.
