After hauling 47 medals at the just concluded Eastern Africa U- 18 and  20 Athletics Championships, Team Kenya have now set sight on the Africa Youth Championships set for Zambia in April. Athletics Kenya youth sub-committee secretary, Joseph Ilovi, on Sunday said he is impressed with the country's performance in Dar-es-salaam and remains optimistic that Kenya will do well at the continental showpiece. During the two-day event in Tanzania, the under-20 team garnered 18 medals while the under-18 team hauled 19. According to Ilovi, the athletes alongside others who did not participate in the Dar-es-salaam championships will gather in Nairobi later this month for Africa U18/20 trials. The team arrived from Tanzania in two batches with the first group of 26 touching down at JKIA at 10 am and the second group arriving at 4.25 pm. “We shall hold Africa Under 18 and 20 trials at Nyayo National Stadium on March 24 and 25 to select athletes who will represent us in Zambia,” Ilovi said on phone from Dar. Selected athletes will represent the country at the Africa U18/20 Championships in Lusaka, Zambia on April 19-23. “We want to select a strong team that will conquer Africa,” said Ilovi. He added that during the trials, they will also select a team for the Africa Youth Games to be held in Brazzaville, Congo. The games were initially scheduled to be held in Cairo, Egypt last year but were later postponed. The event will be used to prepare teams for Summer Youth Olympics to be held in Dakar, Senegal in 2026.
