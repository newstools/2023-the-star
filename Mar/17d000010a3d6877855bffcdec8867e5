Kenya's Ruth Chepngetich clocked 2:17:18 hours to retain her Nagoya Women's Marathon title on Sunday in Japan. Despite not being able to beat her winning time in Nagoya the previous year (2:17:18), Chepngetich nevertheless won by more than three minutes over Ayuko Suzuki of Japan (2:21:52). Honami Maeda of Japan finished third in 2:22:32 during the World Athletics Platinum Label road race. "I'm glad I was able to defend my title. The race went well. Although running by myself was difficult for me. I am glad and proud of today's accomplishments," Chepngetich stated in a post-race interview. She added: “I am happy to be back in Nagoya. My condition was good, and I'm happy I managed to accomplish part of my target for Sunday which was to defend my title with a course record." Chepngetich jumped right to the front of the pack and was outpacing the pacemakers on a sweltering morning. She was 35 seconds ahead of the 15-person chase group at 5 kilometers, which she crossed at 16:19. She led by 76 seconds at 10 kilometers when she passed that checkpoint in 32:34, nine seconds quicker than her course record split from the previous year, but with a faster second half of the race. After covering 15 kilometers in 49 minutes, the 28-year-old picked up the pace over the next 5 kilometers and completed 20 kilometers in 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 14 seconds. She completed the first half of the race in 1 minute, 8 minutes, 47 seconds, which was 16 seconds quicker than her split time, and completed the final 15 kilometers in 1 hour, 17 minutes, and 8 seconds. Chepngetich who also won the Chicago Marathon in 2022 in 2:14:18 — the second-fastest women's time in history — continued to sustain her pace as she passed the 25km mark in 1:21:32. Ayuko Suzuki and Zhang, who were beginning to lose their rivals in the chase pack, were three minutes behind her at 30 kilometers when she finished in 1:37:51 as she continued to race against the clock. Then, as Ayuko Suzuki quickened her pace, she dropped Zhang as well. As the clock read 1:54:24 at 35 kilometers, Chepngetich's pace started to slip, unlike last year when she picked up speed in the second half, but she was still on track for a performance under 2 hours. Maeda had passed Zhang to go into third position, and Ayuko Suzuki was now running at a sub-2:22 pace (1:57:40), 25 seconds faster than Maeda but still three minutes ahead of Chepngetich. Chepngetich persevered, aiming for success. She finished the race in 2:18:08 after reaching the halfway point in 2:11:07 and taking home the $250,000 first-place prize, which is currently the richest in marathon running.
