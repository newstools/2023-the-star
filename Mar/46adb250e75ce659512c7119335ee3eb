New United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Secretary General Cleophas Malala is a man on a mission to make the ruling party more powerful. He has emphasized the need to dissolve other parties within the Kenya Kwanza coalition and join UDA. Speaking on Sunday after attending a church service, Malala said that discussions were underway on the issue. "Issue of parties to fold is an ongoing discussion within Kenya Kwanza. It is a suggestion that has been brought about by our party UDA to ensure we have a strategy toward winning 2027 general elections," he said. The former Kakamega Senator noted that joining the parties with the least elected members will make more sense. "It is not reasonable to have a party with only 10 MCAs or 5 MPs... even speaking economically sense.So it is my humble submission to my kenya kwanza partners to come on board," he added. Last week, Malala told senior government officials in the Kenya Kwanza administration who are still clinging to their parties to choose between being in government or quitting the positions and holding on to their political outfits. “One of my mandates is to begin a dialogue with our partners so as to ensure we have one party against our opponents. We cannot have one government and several colours, that is our position and we shall talk to others," he explained. The remarks could be seen to be targeting Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua, who is the Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader , and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula, who leads Ford Kenya leader. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi left his leadership of the Amani National Congress (ANC) party to Lamu governor Issa Timamy, while Trade Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria’s Chama Cha Kazi (CCK) has already started the process of folding to join UDA.
