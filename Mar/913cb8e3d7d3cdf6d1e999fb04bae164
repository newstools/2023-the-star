Comedienne Elsa Majimbo has described doing business as easier than comedy. Speaking at the Forbes leading women summit in South Africa, she said she has it rough in comedy. "People see me being funny, being light, that's what they always expect from me. I'll have the worst day, comedy is really rough," she said. "Business is really easy because I'm always motivated to make money. Comedy is tougher because everyone expects me to be happy." Majimbo said she created her own career path and can do things on her own terms. "I dictate what I want, when I want." She said so much has changed, including being more educated and being richer than before. In a documentary teaser, Majimbo said she is fully herself when online. "I was in my own space, it was just me. If people were coming, they were coming into my space. I wasn't going into anyoneâ€™s space, so I never had to compromise for anyone." She hinted that she also received condemnation from her close people over her content. Majimbo has in the past spoken about the trolls she received from Kenyans on Twitter. "I have a very complicated relationship with Nairobi," she said. "When things started going well for me, there was a lot of backlash to me and there were a lot of colourist things said towards me and surprisingly, it's people from Kenya who were doing that and they were bullying me on the Internet."
