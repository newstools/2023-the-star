Azimio Leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday faced off with a police officer who barred him from entering the DCI headquarters. The opposition leader had arrived at Mazingira House, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations Headquarters, where former Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i was being questioned. A furious Raila questioned the rationale of blocking him from accessing the offices yet the DCI director's office is a public office. “This is a public office, you want me to order these people to go in by force? This is a public officer, he cannot be ordered not to see the director,” Raila charged. "If they want problems they will get them." The officer, who saluted him before informing him that he was under instructions not to allow him in, defended himself saying consultations were ongoing 'at a higher level'. “What consultations?” Raila posed as the officer pleaded with him outside the gate. "I am under instruction sir that you can't go in, none of you will go in," the officer told Raila. Matiang'i was later released after hours of questioning.
