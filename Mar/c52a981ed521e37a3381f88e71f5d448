Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said that Azimio leaders who are seeking government opportunities must abandon protests. The DP said that the government will not engage those who are participating in protests. "Our brothers(Azimio) were complaining that we are not involving them in government investments. We want to tell them to come here today, if they have plans to change the lives of Kenyans they should come and work with President Ruto," he said. Gachagua said the government is ready to engage them if it is for the sake of developing the country. "Shabal is a leader within the Azimio coalition but we are working with him because he has something to offer the people of Kenya,” Gachagua said. "We are also asking the rest to come and partner with the government. What we wouldn’t agree with them is on protests." The DP also declared that Lang'ata MP Phelix Odiwuor alias Jalang'o belongs to the UDA camp. Gachagua recounted how Jalang'o was chased during the Azimio Parliamentary Group (PG) meeting. "Jalang'o is now in our camp because after meeting President William Ruto at State House on matters of development, he was chased from the Azimo meeting," he said. Gachagua also urged Daragoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi to join the Kenya Kwanza camp as it only focuses on development. "I am so happy to see Beatrice Elachi, we want you with us, if I see you at the demonstrations I will be sad, we know you don't know how to throw stones," he said. The DP spoke during the groundbreaking ceremony for affordable housing project.
