It will cost Sh 3.5 billion to repair Mombasa road damages during Expressway Construction. Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen on Friday told the Senate that the contractor is expected to start the work soon. “It became practical and we asked ourselves if the initial Ksh. 9 billion was going to be very elaborate with certain beautification. We worked with a budget of Sh3.5 billion to bring back the road to certain standards and good drainage so that later we can add these other additional issues, ” he said Murkomen noted that the repairs will see a drastic change in terms of inconvenience along the ever-busy Mombasa road. Revealing more details, the CS said that the repair would take at least seven hours to reduce any inconvenience along the road. In addition, Murkomen said the government was committed to renovating the Sh88 billion road. "We have already moved all the utility lines like water, sewage and electricity and in doing that the road was damaged so we have to bear the cost of repairs,” he said. The expressway seeks to decongest Mombasa Road, Uhuru Highway and Waiyaki Way but has experienced traffic since it was opened to the public. The road has 11 tolling stations, 54 toll plazas, and 54 cameras along the  27km expressway, with 126 cameras inside the toll plazas. The road is monitored with recordings being done at 30 minutes intervals. There’s a smart monitoring system that detects congestion, spillage, vehicle reversals, pedestrian crossing and emergencies. The dual carriageway has 11 interchanges at Mlolongo, Standard Gauge Railway, JKIA, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass, Capital Centre, Haile Selassie Avenue, Museum Hill, Westlands, and James Gichuru Road. The expressway, with 18.2km on the ground and 8.9km elevated, is a class A, four-lane dual carriageway with a design speed of 80km per hour. The project is one of retired president Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy.
