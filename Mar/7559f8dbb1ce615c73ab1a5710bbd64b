A 25-year-old man died after being hit in the head in a quarrel over space during a televised football match in Ongata Rongai, Kajiado. The man succumbed to his injuries on Monday following the scuffle at a joint in the township. Police said they are looking for a known suspect. The man had Sunday afternoon walked to the shopping centre to watch the match but did not have an entry fee of Sh50 that was needed to enable him to sit there. This forced him to watch the game through the window. In the process, he allegedly picked up a quarrel with one of those who were struggling to have a glimpse of the match through the same spot. It was then that the assailant reportedly hit him on the head with a blunt object before escaping. The victim went to his nearby home and slept in pain, his brother told police. On Monday, he complained of more pain and was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Police visited the scene. The body was moved to the mortuary where an autopsy is planned as part of the probe. The said assailant is yet to be found for questioning but police handling the matter said they are looking for him. A team of police has so far recorded statements from witnesses in the case.
