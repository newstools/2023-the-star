Police in Narok West subcounty are investigating a road accident in which a tourist died and two others were injured in the Maasai Mara on Sunday. The accident happened near the Serena Hotel. Narok county commissioner Isaac Masinde said the tourists were in a Toyota Land Cruiser belonging to Bush Adventure, which was being driven by Antony Munene, aged 50. The vehicle had five passengers, three Germans and two Swiss, at the time of the accident. “The vehicle was from Fisi Camp in Oloolemutia heading to Isabania border and on reaching at the location of accident about 1km to Mara Bridge, the vehicle swayed, veered off the road and overturned due to muddy road condition,” Masinde said. Following the accident, a male German aged about 50 years sustained a deep cut on the head and died on the spot, while another German sustained head injuries. One Swiss sustained neck injuries. The other Swiss and the German escaped unhurt. The two injured tourists were rushed to Serena Airstrip and airlifted to Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi. The body was ferried by road to Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi, while the vehicle was towed to Ololulunga police station. A heavy downpour has been experienced in the Mara, which has made many roads impassable.
