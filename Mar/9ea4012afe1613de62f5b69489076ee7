Fifty students who sat for KCSE exams in 2022 and were unable to join Form 1 due to financial constraints, can now smile after the intervention by Limuru MP John Kiragu. Kiragu said the needy students will be assisted with proceeds that were raised during the Limuru marathon that happened last weekend at Rironi Primary School He saidÂ his office has set aside some money from what was raised and will be used to pay for needy students' school fees. "We realised that even as we offer bursaries from the CDF kitty to the secondary school students that there were others who might not join Form 1 due to their families' financial status," Kiragu said. He said the fees will cater for the feeding program and uniform. Kiragu spoke at Manguo Secondary School in his constituency, where he handed over seven Form 1 students to the school. He was accompanied by Limuru director of education Murage Gate, the school board of management, teachers and students. To sustain the students in school, the MP said such efforts will be done to ensure funds are raised. "We shall organise for golf tournaments, hold another marathon, and do other kinds of fundraising," he said. Gate said the move was important since it was helping the government to achieve its primary school to secondary school 100 per cent transition. He urged parents and stakeholders to support schools so that students can perform and earn good grades.
