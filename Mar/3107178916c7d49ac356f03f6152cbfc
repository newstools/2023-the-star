Men's beach volleyball teams registration for the first edition of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya beach games is closed after hitting target ahead of deadline. The deadline for registration was set for Wednesday but eight teams (maximum number required) have already registered for the two-day championship, set for Buntwani Waterfront Park, Malindi, this weekend. General Service Unit, Trail Blazers, Mombasa Prisons, Administration Police Kenya and Prisons Kenya have all fronted a team each. Equity Bank have registered three teams. "Due to the magnitude of the event, which includes other disciplines with beach version, Nock requires only eight teams per gender for this tournament. Therefore, the first eight teams to register shall be accorded the opportunity to participate in the tournament," read part of Nock's statement. This will be a 4x4 beach volleyball championship organised under FIVB and Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (Anoca) rules and regulations. The rules require four players per team and a coach on the bench. "It is also a build up towards the forthcoming Africa Beach Games and subsequent World Beach Games slated for later this year," the statement added. All teams are required to register and cover their transport and upkeep while prizes will be awarded to medalists. So far, no women's team has registered and it remains to be seen whether they will, now that the KVF women's league second leg fixtures are set for Nyayo Stadium this weekend.
