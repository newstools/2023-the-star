 Samuel Lomoi may have to wait longer for his cash prize after placing 14th in the Eldoret City Marathon last year. Organisers are set to pay the top 20 athletes who competed in last year’s Eldoret City Marathon but Lomoi will miss out after being sanctioned by the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya. Lomoi is eligible to pocket Sh60,000 but because he is still under suspension for violating anti-doping rules, he will have to wait for his verdict to determine his fate. All athletes eligible for prizes have been asked to avail themselves at the Uasin Gishu county headquarters to receive their cheques and other goodies after waiting for close to one year. On the doping issues, the double Boston Marathon champion said they are relying on ADAK to guide them further before issuing payment. “Besides Lomoi, we will confirm with ADAK who needs to be paid and who doesn't,” he noted. “ We have sent our prize list to them and as usual, they will guide us on the way forward in as far as payment is concerned,” he stated. Tanui said he will send all the names of athletes on the prize list and he will take their advice before writing the cheques.
