Strathmore Scorpions striker Grace Bwire believes the kits and gears provided to players by the institution have helped alleviate some life burdens as she concentrates on the game. Bwire played for Blazers before joining the varsity side after playing for the Women's national team in the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, August last year. The athletic forward revealed that she struggled to raise enough money to buy personal equipment in her previous clubs. "Hockey is an expensive sport in terms of equipment and gear as well as accessing standard playing surfaces. So I had challenges in acquiring  the right kits and gear  when I started. However, playing for Strathmore has helped ease my struggles." Most of the players in the Kenya Hockey Union Leagues provide themselves with equipment since  a good number of teams are self-supporting. Bwire helped 'Strath' win their first Premier League title in January this year. She believes there's more to come from her as she intends to become a big part of the students success on the field. "We have already set the standard of what we set out to achieve in the Premier League.  I want to be a big part of the team as we challenge for more silverware." "We also would like to compete at the African Cup for Club Championship once more and correct the things we were unable to accomplish  in the last tournament." The former Multi Media University player is proud of her career thus far adding: "The networks and contacts I have made and the chance to travel places makes me do extra in training. The opportunity to progress in life including my scholarship at Strathmore gives hope of a brighter future."
