I told them [the hospital] I wanted to lose weight but not this much coz I still want to be a curvy girl," she said. In a recent video on Tiktok, she said she is on silicon that lasts for eight months. Kate Actress also said the procedure only proves effective and works if one learns how to control their food portion intake and workouts. "If you don't learn portion control and how to eat light and move your body, utakuwa unafanya zero work. You still have to put in some work." Willis Raburu and Oficial Kinuthia are among the other celebrities who have opted for the gastric balloon procedure. Jackie Matubia said since the gastric procedure, she eats less and feels full faster.
