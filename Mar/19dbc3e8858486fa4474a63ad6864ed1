Team Kenya will be represented by 50 swimmers at the Kampala Invitational Swimming Championship slated for April 15-19. Various counties have done their qualifying events for the event where Kenyan swimmers will be up against Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe in the four-day championship. Nairobi, Uasin Gishu, Nakuru and Kiambu will each provide 10 swimmers to the championships with the final squad expected to be announced days to the event. Nairobi County swimming secretary Kenneth Karani said the Nairobi County Aquatic Associations event saw several new talents emerge. “We have unearthed new talents in the county and we are trying to finalise the selection process and soon the swimmers should start training for the championships," said Karani. Karani said the country will also be sending swimmers to the Hamilton Sizzler Swimming  Championships in Dubai in June. “These two championships will be key for our swimmers. We want to expose them to world-class competitions," added Karani.
