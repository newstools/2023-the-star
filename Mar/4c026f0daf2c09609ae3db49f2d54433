Senators on Wednesday warned the Salaries and Remuneration Commission against taxing car grants for Members of the County Assemblies. In a heated contribution during the afternoon sitting, the Senators told off the SRC over plans to slap the car grants with taxation. Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has warned that the SRC was crippling the oversight mandate by MCAs. Cherargei said the Senate will stand firm to defend MCAs from what he termed as 'financial frustrations' from SRC. "How do you put the tax in a car grant, they are usurping powers yet their work is advisory. The MCAs are the first line of defence for the common Mwananchi," Cherargei said. Speaking when making a contribution in the Senate following a visit by MCAs from Vihiga county, Cherargei asked the senate to protect MCAs. "The SRC must be stopped in its tracks because what they are doing is illegal, if you cripple the MCAs then you are crippling oversight," he said. The welfare of MCAs attracted fury from other senators with Vihiga's Godfrey Osotsi warning the SRC over its punitive move. "SRC has mishandled MCAs, they reduced significantly their salaries, and now SRC is asking MCAs to pay additional tax on car grants," he said. "We can't see our partners in the oversight process being frustrated by a constitutional body." The senator asked the senate to make sure that MCAs perform their oversight role in a dignified manner. According to the SRC, MCAs are entitled to car loans of up to Sh2 million payable at three per cent interest within their term in office.
