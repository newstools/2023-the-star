Police in Nakuru are looking for a businessman suspected to have killed his wife in Racecourse estate. The man is said to have confessed to his son after stabbing his 41-year-old wife. The body was found lying in a pool of blood in their rented house. Nakuru East Sub-County Police Commander Martin Masika said the woman’s body was wrapped in a bed sheet and had seven stab wounds in the face, chest and stomach. Masika said police were treating the man as the prime suspect because of his suspicious behaviour immediately after the incident. He is said to have faked a robbery and lied about his wife’s whereabouts. He observed that the murder scene was disturbed with household items strewn all over the room. The couple is said to have been blessed with three children and has been living peacefully. However, on that fateful day, the man allegedly called their son, a university student, and confessed to the murder. A neighbour said he went to the house to check on the woman after her son informed him that his father had confessed to killing her. “I went to the house at about 1:20 pm after speaking to the son and confirmed the shocking murder. The police had also arrived after being alerted by residents,” a neighbour said. A family friend said she became suspicious when the suspect left his mobile phone, car and house keys with her claiming that he was going on a business trip in Kisumu. “He told me they had been attacked while travelling from Mau and that his wife was at the police station reporting the matter,” she said. The body was removed from the scene as police continued with their investigations into the murder.
