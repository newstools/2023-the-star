Siaya Governor James Orengo has defended his party leader Raila Odinga following alleged attacks by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. Orengo said when Raila was fighting for multi-party democracy in the country, Gachagua was still a District Officer. "We are coming out, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," he said. He spoke on Saturday during the burial ceremony of Luo elder Ker Willis Opiyo Otondi in Kisumu. Orengo said Raila has never been taken to court about anything, and Gachagua can't make it his mandate to be speaking about Raila in the public. The DP has on several occasions addressed Raila's political rallies, saying his boss President William Ruto is not open for a handshake. Gachagua said the only discussion that would happen with the opposition leader was on how to have him exit politics. “Your Excellency, you should only consider having one discussion-to exit from politics and permanent retirement from the politics of Kenya…that your Excellency, you have our support and we can have that discussion,” he said. Raila, he claimed, was a “rabble-rouser” whose aim was to cause confusion and disintegrate the Kenya Kwanza leadership. “Baba yake alisumbua baba ya Uhuru, akasumbua Moi, amechukua Uhuru amemuweka kwa mtaro sasa mnataka aweke rais wetu kwa mtaro? he posed.
