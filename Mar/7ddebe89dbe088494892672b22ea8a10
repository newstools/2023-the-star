The 2023 Lewa Safari Marathon will be held on June 24, the organisers have announced. As it has been the case for the event first held in 2000, the marathon will seek to raise funds to empower communities around the Lewa Conservancy and beyond as well as conserve wildlife. This year, participants are encouraged to ‘Ditch the Desk’ and connect with nature instead, as they follow a route across savannah plains, along river banks and through acacia woodland. Since inception, the race has raised over eight million dollars in support of conservation and community initiatives throughout Kenya. Nearly four million dollars have been invested in the direct protection of endangered species, other wildlife and their habitats. Peter Ndegwa, CEO of  Safaricom said : “We are proud to be part of this noble cause as we run to create awareness and take action to conserve our wildlife. We have been part of Lewa Safari Marathon’s journey of success since its inception in 2000.” Lewa Marathon ambassador, Eliud Kipchoge, the world marathon record holder, said: “To me, a running world is a happy world. We are all part of the human family and we must keep strong and stay fit for our wellbeing.” “By running together, we can also conserve our environment, empower our communities, take care of our wildlife and support those at Lewa working for a future for us all.” Ndegwa added: “Today, we are proud to extend our partnership as we sponsor the event for Sh10 million. The event means a lot to us as a company because we aim to support the growth and development of sports talents, while conserving the country’s environment and wildlife.” Huawei deputy CEO Sheng Kaifu, said: “Huawei is delighted to have supported the Lewa Safari Marathon for the past 16 years. The conservancy is home to some of the rarest wildlife and we know through our support and that of Safaricom, a difference has been made in preserving these iconic species for future generations as well as the surrounding communities."
