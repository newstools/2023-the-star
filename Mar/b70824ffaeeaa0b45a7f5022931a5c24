MPs have questioned the Sh250 million which was to be allocated to Uzima University in the Supplementary Budget. "It was not clear why the allocation was only to one university when the problem is facing most public universities," the report reads. The Education committee noted that the allocation was to settle pending bills for government-sponsored students. In a previous meeting, committee chairman Julius Melly questioned why the allocation was sent to one university. Melly said the concerns over the funding of government students in private universities was a blanket issue. "I have seen a letter from the immediate former CS National Treasury over this Sh250 million, why are we only talking about this university?" Melly paused. Lugari MP Nabii Nabwera faulted the ministry for what he termed a plan to privatise universities. Nabwera said the pending bills include deferred salaries and unpaid part-time lectures. Appearing before the Melly-led committee, Higher Education PS Beatrice Inyangala defended the allocation saying the institution is in a tough situation. "The students cleared school, they graduated but still the government has not sent their money. The school risks being visited by auctioneers," she explained. According to the Universities Fund, the debts in varsities had hit Sh56 billion as of June 2022.
