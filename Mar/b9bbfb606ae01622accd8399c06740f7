Lamu county government of Lamu has set aside Sh10 million towards the commencement of immediate restoration of the county’s largest and only freshwater lake, Lake Kenyatta. For years, the lake’s chances of survival continues to dim owing to immense human activity including encroachment of its wetlands, sand harvesting, siltation and over-grazing. Covering an estimated 5 square kilometres (1,200 acres) is an ecological site and supports herds of flora and fauna among them hippopotami, zebra, monkeys, waterbuck, buffalo, warthog and a large variety of birds. Located in Mpeketoni in Lamu West and named after the first president Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, Lake Kenyatta serves freshwater to over 80,000 households in the region. Governor Issa Timamy expressed his concern over the shrinking water levels in the lake and said immediate action was required to save it from totally drying up. In 2017, conservationists were sent into a panic after the lake dried up completely following a prolonged dry spell that hit the region. The situation led to the destruction of the lake's ecosystem and marine life. The recovery since then has been slow and unsure. “We have instituted measures to save the lake as a county. We have set aside Sh10 million towards that. We can’t risk the lake dying out because both people and animals in this county will suffer. We are calling on partners to support us on this,” Timamy said. He said plans are underway to ensure all those occupying the lake lands are immediately relocated to pave way for restoration efforts. Timamy has urged for non-politicization of the efforts and called for cooperation from leaders across the county to make the process successful. “I don’t live in Mpeketoni but am still governor of the people there and that’s why am taking a personal initiative to see to it that this lake doesn’t die out. I pray we won’t politicize this. Let's focus on the Lake and its benefit to the people and future generations,” he said.
