Uganda's police on Wednesday briefly closed a busy expressway that connects the capital, Kampala, to the country's main airport after a security scare. A bomb squad was deployed to conduct an investigation along the Entebbe expressway before it was cleared for public use,Â according to tweets by police. Motorists were diverted to the old road that runs near the expressway until investigations ended and normal traffic flow restored. The Chinese-funded expressway was opened in 2018 and is the first-ever toll road in the country.
