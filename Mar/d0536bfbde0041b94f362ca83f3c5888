Kisumu county government on Friday suspended boda boda operations within Milimani and Tom Mboya estates to curb rising insecurity. In a statement, city manager Abala Wanga said it follows rising cases of robbery with violence in the two estates where residents complained of being mugged of their phones by people riding on boda bodas. "A recent case was reported yesternight where a lady and her son were attacked in Milimani as they were strolling at around 8.45 pm," Abala said. Milimani and Tom Mboya estates are affluent residential areasÂ considered the leafy suburbs of the lakeside city. Abala said in view of the rising cases of insecurity in the estates, boda boda operations are suspended with immediate effect to enhance security in the estates. "Under the provision of the above-cited Acts, a notice is hereby issued that any rider found operating in Milimani will be apprehended and legal action instituted against them," Abala said. He said should a rider wish to pick up or drop a passenger in the area, he should make prior arrangements with the client to avoid getting in trouble with the law. "Take further notice that all boda boda sheds within the Milimani area are now rendered illegal and those operating in those sheds should look for alternative places," the city manager said.
