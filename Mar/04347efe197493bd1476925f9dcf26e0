Retired President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday urged Nigeria's elections losers to maintain peace after the election exercise. While condemning a few incidences of political instability witnessed in the country before and after the ballot, Uhuru urged them to move to court if they felt aggrieved by the outcome. He also took the opportunity to remind  Nigerians that there was life after elections. Uhuru who is the head of the African Union Election Observers Mission (AUEOM) spoke after meeting election losers. On Wednesday, Labour Party candidate Peter Obi announced that he would challenge the victory of All Progressive Congress candidate, Bola Tinubu,  in court. His running mate Yusuf Datti-Ahmed confirmed the statement during a meeting with party supporters. "Here is an incoming government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that is illegal and unconstitutional. We are submitting our case to the court of law, let them show again that level of confidence," he said. Peoples Democratic Party contender Atiku Abubakar, emerged second in the election. Abubakar said that he would also seek legal address on the election results. PDP Campaign Committee chair Dino Melaye promised a fierce battle in court to reclaim what he referred to as a grave injustice and a theft of Atiku's rightful mandate. Tinubu garnered 8,794,726, while Atiku and Obi garnered 6,984,520 and 6,101,533 votes respectively. Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission maintained that the election was free and fair and asked anyone with a different opinion to move to court. INEC warned candidates against inciting members of the public against the Commission or making inflammatory marks that would disturb peaceful co-existence.
