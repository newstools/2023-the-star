Wadadia recorded their fifth win of the season after getting the better of Kangemi Ladies 4-2 in the Kenya Women's Premier League match on Sunday. Monica Nyakoa opened the scoring in the 14th minute with a neat finish to give the Mumias-based side 1-0 lead inside the opening 15 minutes. Benta Wanyama restored parity for Kangemi, finding the back of the net in the 42nd minute to make it 1-1 as the halftime whistle sounded. Lydia Juma made it 2-1 in favour of Kangemi. Juma scored in the 63rd minute leaving Wadadia shell-shocked. However, three goals in the last 20 minutes powered Wadadia to a crucial victory. Mercy Mang'uro scored a brace in the 73rd and 83rd minutes respectively. Jackline Chesang also got her name on the scoresheet with a 77th-minute penalty goal. Despite the win, Wadadia remains in seventh position courtesy of an inferior goal difference. Kangemi on the other hand, are 11th in the 12-team league with a meager three points. The Kawangware side has mastered just one win in 11 matches.
