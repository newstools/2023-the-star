Tanasha Donna's son Naseeb Junior visited his father, Diamond Platnumz, over the weekend. A recent video of Diamond and Naseeb Junior riding in his Rolls Royce Cullinan went viral. In one of the videos, when the back left door opened, Diamond and Naseeb alighted wearing black, white and golden Arabic-themed outfits. Manara was at hand to welcome them before leading them through a red carpet to his house. In yet another video inside Manara's home, Diamond lovingly talked to his three-year-old son. Fans of the musician on social media celebrated the father and son reunion. It is not clear if Naseeb travelled with his mum Tanasha Donna. In a past interview, Tanasha said the Bongo Flava artiste sends her cash for upkeep, school and everything else their son needs.
