MPs from northern Kenya want the military to take full charge of the security operation in the area to flush out bandits. The legislators have asked President William Ruto to move to Parliament to seek approval to deploy the Kenya Defence Force in the troubled region. “The President should without delay seek parliamentary approval to allow the KDF to take full charge of the ongoing security operation led by police in the banditry-prone region,” said Saku MP Dido Rasso. The police are currently leading the security operation in the region with the assistance of KDF officers. “We cannot deploy KDF to the region only to be told they are under police,” Nandi senator Samson Cherargei said. Violence in the region has claimed more than 100 civilians and six police officers in the past six months. The operation is being carried out in Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu counties. Attacks on innocent people are still being reported even after the police and military launched a joint operation to eliminate banditry. On Sunday, bandits staged a daytime retaliatory attack in the volatile Seretion village in Mochongoi ward, Baringo South on Sunday. They injured a police reservist and made away with over 200 livestock. And on Tuesday, two medical workers were killed in the Kerio Valley, bringing to seven the number of people killed in Elgeyo Marakwet county alone in four days. On Wednesday, the northern Kenya legislators regretted saying attacks have continued despite the security presence. Addressing a press conference at Parliament Buildings, the lawmakers further asked the government to ban any movement of livestock in the troubled region Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago said bandits have been ferrying stolen animals freely.
