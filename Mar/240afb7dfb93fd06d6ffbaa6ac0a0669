Kisumu county to resume demonstrations for two days ahead of Azimio's Monday mega demos in Nairobi. According to Kisumu leaders led by Deputy Governor Mathew Owili, the demos will be held on Wednesday and Friday within the lakeside city in honour of Azimio leader Raila Odinga's call for mass action. "From next week, the people will be rolling themselves until our demands are heard and action is taken to lower the high cost of living in the country," he said. Owili said as the demos will start at 10 am, where leaders from the various subcounties will converge at Kondele first. Thereafter, the procession will move to the City Square and then to the county commissioner's office where they will present their petition. County assembly speaker Elisha Oraro called on all Kenyans and citizens within the county to join them from tomorrow. "Kenyans who feel the high cost of living is skyrocketing and pinch them should join us in the demonstrations," he said. He urged Nyanza region leaders who are shifting UDA to come back to their senses and support Raila's move for reforms. "If we can't restore our economy now and push for lowering of the cost of living then this will the things will be tougher even in 2027," he said. "On this day, leaders from the various subcounties will be leading their people in the last demonstrations as we close for the grandmother of all demos in Nairobi on Monday."
