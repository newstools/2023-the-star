Authorities are investigating an incident in which a patient who had been admitted to the Kenyatta National Hospital died by suicide. Officials said Timothy Kinuthia, 22, had been admitted to ward 7B on the 7th floor of the hospital when he jumped to the ground floor and died on the spot. The incident happened on March 2 at about 1 am when most patients were asleep. It is not clear how long the patient had been at the facility. Security personnel at the hospital said they heard a loud bang on the ground floor and on checking, they found the patient had already died. They called the police who processed the scene and moved the body to the mortuary. Nairobi police boss Adamson Bungei said they do not know what motivated the patientâ€™s moves. Such incidents have been reported at the same facility in the past. Officials there said they are making efforts to stop such future tragedies. Cases of suicide have been on the rise in the country amid calls to tame the trend. Up to five cases are at times reported daily. Elsewhere in Waithaka, police are investigating an incident in which the body of one Joseph Kinuthia Wanjiku, 33, was found while in a sitting position on a chair inside his house. Police said the body, which had no physical injuries, was taken to Kikuyu hospital mortuary awaiting a postmortem examination. It is not clear what caused the death.
