Two children on Wednesday morning were killed in a  bandit attack on a village in Laisamis, Marsabit county. A 38-year-old man was also killed. County police commander Robinson Mboloi said the children were aged five and seven. The attack happened in Korolle which has borne the brunt of such incidents. Mboloi said the attackers stole dozens of livestock. This is the latest such incident in the region. On January 12, at least eight people were killed and three others injured in a bandit attack at Yell Kurkum village in Laisamis. Among the killed were three children and five men, police said. Police said about 15 armed bandits raided the village at around 6am. The bandits made away with an unknown number of camels and goats. Residents said they do not have guns to protect themselves against such attacks after last year’s disarmament that took away their weapons. They have pledged to get more of the weapons for their protection even after President William Ruto declared no herder will be allowed to use weapons to graze or protect their animals. An operation is ongoing in neighbouring counties of Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu. Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in banditry-prone areas as he declared them disturbed and dangerous. The 30-day curfew started Tuesday, February 14, to enable the operation go on. Up to 43 guns have so far been recovered. Some residents of Marsabit and Isiolo want the operation be extended there. In Laisamis, police said a multi-agency security team was deployed to pursue the attackers. Such attacks are common as raiders strike for livestock, leaving a trail of deaths and injuries. There are fears the affected clan will retaliate. Tension remain in the area. (Edited by V. Graham)
