DJ Fatxo is a person of interest in the case after the young interior designer fell to his death while visiting the singer. Addressing the press after detectives probing the death left his rented apartment in Kasarani, Fatxo said he is also interested in knowing the truth. "We all want to know the truth of what happened and we believe that justice will prevail," he said. The Mugithi singer went on to say that he will schedule a day to speak to Kenyans about the matter even as he exuded confidence that the challenge will pass. It is alleged that Mwathi fell from the 12th floor of Redwood Apartments along Thika Road where the DJ lives. The circumstances under which he died are still unclear. It is said he was with a group of friends partying. Reports show the victim had spent the day with the popular DJ. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, homicide department visited the apartment on Friday. This was after a directive from the interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki instructing DCI Mohamed Amin to send a homicide team from the DCI headquarters to thoroughly investigate the incident and take the necessary action “I thank the DCI for his quick action on this matter. The homicide team from the DCI headquarters is dispassionate, and this will help resolve the claims of collusion at Kasarani Police Station where the matter was reported,” he said.
