Singer, songwriter and performing artiste Nviiri the Storyteller yesterday held a show in honour of International Women's Day, which is marked globally today. The 'Pombe Sigara' hitmaker held a virtual live stream performance at Snowball Industries studio, Red Hill. The virtual performance saw him perform two songs from his upcoming album. During his performance, the award-winning artiste sent flowers to his top five fans. "Through his performance, he was also promoting Women's Day in honour of the women in his life," read a statement. Mid-last year, Nviiri who is signed under Sol Generation, announced the release of 'Party', which pays homage to the journey he has been on over the last few years since he became one of Africa’s breakout stars. “This is arguably one of my favourite tracks I’ve worked on in a while, because it’s a great example of the style of music I want to create more of,” he said at the time. “As I step into this next phase of my career as an artist, I really want to produce more music that speaks to my lifestyle, professional experience, and spirituality. This song gives my fans a glimpse of what it’s like to be me, and I know they are gonna love it,” he concluded.
