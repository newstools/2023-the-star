The National Youth Service (NYS) will today hold its pass out parade ceremony at the Gilgil training academy in Nakuru. President William Ruto is expected to preside over the event that will see a new cluster graduate after undergoing a six-month initial paramilitary training. They are also trained in various skills including engineering, fashion and design, business management, catering, agriculture, secretarial, plant operation and construction. With the service having undergone a transformation since 2013, the number of recruits has increased to close to 30,000 annually. During the last graduation ceremony in June last year, retired President Uhuru Kenyatta directed security agencies to absorb more NYS graduates into their ranks saying they had proven to be reliable, diligent and excellent workers. “I reiterate my directive to the Police Service and all other disciplined services to redouble their efforts towards the absorption of the NYS cohorts into their ranks,” he said. The institution has already launched a servicemen and women tracking system. The technology-enabled tracking and reporting system enables employers to access a database of NYS graduates among other benefits.
