Embattled Jubilee secretary general Jeremiah Kioni has cautioned pro-William Ruto MPs who are fighting him. The SG said the party is not owned by an individual because it belongs to all members. Speaking on Tuesday, Kioni said the party is their voice and anyone who wants to take it away will have to fight for it with members. He also warned that the members will not let anyone play with their voice. "Wale ambao wanafikiria Jubilee ni yangu ama mtu mwingine, we have opened the party to everybody. If you think you are taking it away from an individual, you'll be taking it away from these members you are seeing here. Be prepared to deal with them. The time for playing is gone. This party is our voice not something to play with," Kioni said. He spoke after a meeting with the party's People Living With Disability league at the party headquarters. Kioni's remarks come even as the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal is yet to hear a case where Kioni and David Murathe are challenging their ousters as SG and vice chairman respectively. The case which was set to be heard on Tuesday could not proceed after two lawyers claimed to have been hired to represent the two. Murathe and Kioni filed a petition with the tribunal after pro-Ruto MPs kicked them out, and picked an interim team to replace them. Eala MP Kanini Kega was picked as the acting SG, Rachel Nyamai was appointed National Treasurer replacing Kagwe Gichohi, while Murathe was replaced by Eldas MP Adan Keynan.
