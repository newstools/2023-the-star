Newly elected Kenya Primary Schools Sports Association (KPSSA) national chairman Ben Achieng has promised to re-introduce gymnastics once the school games resume. Achieng, who was elected national chairman during the national elections held on Monday at Jogoo House, Nairobi, said he wants to give opportunities to athletes in 'sidelined' disciplines. “I really want to bring back gymnastics to school games because of their great entertainment as well as opening doors for talented athletes. If funds will be available, of which we have been promised, we shall do that during ball games,” he said. Achieng, the Yala Township headmaster, floored Chris Lipondo to capture the position after garnering 18 votes against Lipondo’s nine. She also plans to send games teachers to training on basics in sports to enrich their knowledge. “Once we settle in office, we shall take clinics to all the eight regions to ensure that everybody is involved. I will sit down with the executive members and all stakeholders to ensure that we nurture these talents at the primary school level,” he added. However, he is anticipating a rough ride following a tough two years due to the coronavirus pandemic. “It will be a tall order to rise to the top again but we are organising ourselves. With various clinics planned, rest assured that things will change for the better this year,” promised Achieng. The Siaya County-born administrator will be deputised by Ahamed Dekkow from North Eastern, secretary remains Etyang Mamai from Rift Valley, who will be assisted by Eastern’s Dianah Wambua and treasurer is Margaret Ngale from Coast. The executive members are Sarah Muhonja from Western, Charles Maina (Central), Patrick Mbui, Raha Abdi, Alice Nyabone, James Marite, Issa Kibwana and Muamud Ahmed.
