KCB RFC are confident they will come out on top when they take on Kabras Sugar in the 2022â€“23 Kenya Cup final at the Kakamega show grounds on Saturday afternoon. With 51 points at the end of the regular season, KCB placed second on the log, while Kabras took first place and the right to host the Kenya Cup final. In a bid to hone their talons for the crucial tie, the bankers met up with the rugby squad from Kakamega High School, known as the Barbarians, for a joint practice session on Friday. KCB RFC assistant coach Denis Mwanja advised his players to "punch above their weight" to restore their prior glory. "We enter this final with our heads held high, aware of the importance of the contest. We must be highly clever and tactical when we take on Kabras because they are worthy opponents. "To prevail and, perhaps, regain our former greatness, we must be determined and work as a unit. We encourage all of our supporters to attend on Saturday. Kakamega High School principal, Dr. Mambili, and the school's coach, Curtis Olago, led the KCB squad in planting trees at the institution in another activity. The exercise was implemented to encourage environmental preservation, in line with the bank's active sustainability goal with climate action. Following the visit from the KCB team, Benedict Omondi, captain of the Kakamega High School rugby team, expressed his joy. "This is the first time a prominent rugby club has visited us. In Kakamega High School's history, this day is significant. I truly thank KCB for being a mentor to us and for making the effort to come to see us. We wish them luck as they deal with the Kabras."
