A Kenyan and two foreigners accused of allegedly issuing bribes and match-fixing were on Monday charged before a Makadara court. Akhiad kubev,(Russian), Benard Nabende(Ugandan) and Martin Munga(Kenyan) were accused of conspiring to cheat in a match-fixing football game. They are alleged to have committed the offence on dates between February 3 and March 10 in Roysambu within Nairobi County. The three faced another charge that on March 10 in Roysambu within Nairobi County, with others not in court, by use of a fraudulent trick they induced Samson Otieno the team manager of city stars to deliver football match-fixing of city stars versus sofa paka FC. The game was said to would have been played at Ruaraka, Kenya Breweries playing ground on March 11 at 1500 hours. They promised to pay Otieno 14000 USD at the end of the match an act that could have influenced the result of the game. They denied the charges before Principal Magistrate Eric Mûtûnga of Makadara Law Courts and requested lenient bond terms. They were released on a bond of Sh300,000 with two sureties of a similar amount. The case will be mentioned on April 3 and the hearing was set to be on July 17. Their arrests come as Kenya’s leagues face greater scrutiny over match-fixing and player corruption in competitions sanctioned by the Football Kenya Federation (FKF). “Due to the sensitivity of the case, FKF will not be commenting further on the matter until investigations are concluded.” Otieno said the federation was committed to ensuring the integrity of the sport and was working with local and international security agencies to prosecute the individuals. Kenyan leagues have been hit with a series of suspensions in recent months as part of a national probe into match-fixing in football for betting purposes.
