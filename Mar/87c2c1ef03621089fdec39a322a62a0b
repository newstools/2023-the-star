Azimio leaders led by Raila Odinga on Sunday attended a church service at Tononoka Shalom Miracle Church Mombasa. The leaders are expected to hold a rally at Caltex Grounds in Likoni after the church service. Leaders accompanying Raila are Narc leader Martha Karua, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Jubilee secretary general Jeremiah Kioni, Embakasi East MP Babu Owino among other leaders. Mombasa ODM branch secretary general Geoffrey Busaka confirmed that the rally is on and that they were ready to welcome their party leader. “I want to confirm to you that our party leader will be here to lead us for a mega economic rally on Sunday,” said Busaka. Busaka said that the rally will be for all those who feel disenfranchised by the President William Ruto-led regime and feel the need to push for economic reforms in the country. He reiterated that Mombasa is still an ODM zone as he rallied supporters within the county to turn out in large numbers. He said that ODM as a party does not recognize Ruto as the President, saying that they believe Raila’s victory was stolen in the August 2022 general elections. “We shall continue questioning the legitimacy of Ruto, we only recognize ‘Baba’ (Odinga) as our fifth president because we know his victory was stolen,” Busaka said. He further called on the police to provide them with protection during the rally, warning them against inciting the public by confronting them. Busaka said that the rallies and protests are peaceful, alluding that it is the police who incite the crowds to riot. ODM Mombasa youth league leader Zubeida Mikwara called on the youth to maintain calm during the rally, assuring the business community in Likoni that no property will be destroyed. “This is going to be a peaceful rally like the ones already taking place in other parts of the country. I assure you no youth will be used to destroy or distract any business,” said Mikwara.
