Kenya under-21 women's hockey team suffered a second successive defeat in the ongoing Africa Junior Cup in Ismailia, Egypt. The Meshack Senge coached side lost 5-0 in the hands of rampant South Africa in the day two of the competition on Monday. Kock Tamlyn grabbed a brace while the trio of May Kutlwano, Le Roux Mikkela and Coltman Jesquinique scored a goal each to inflict Kenya with the heaviest  defeat thus far in the four-day championship. Kenya began the competition on the wrong foot after going down 2-0 against hosts Egypt on Sunday. Kenya will play Zimbabwe on Tuesday in the dead rubber match because they are already out of the  Hockey Junior World Cup qualifiers.
