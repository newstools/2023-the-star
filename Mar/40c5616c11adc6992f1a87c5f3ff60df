Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Super League leader Shabana has bolstered their squad by signing two players from Administration Police Service (APS), Bomet. The club’s secretary general, Elizaphan Kerama, confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Erick Ongiri and defender George Onyango aka Onyi. “We have reached an agreement with APS Bomet to sign the players on loan until the end of the season. They are available for selection in our next game against Darajani Gogo,” Kerama said on Wednesday. Kerama further hinted that the club will sign four more players in the current transfer window. “Some of the players we identified are already training with us.” Former utility Maurice Dukully is among the players likely to make a comeback alongside striker Cornelius Juma who is currently in the books of Kenya Premier League (KPL) side, Kenya Police. “We currently have a solid squad but the league has become very competitive. For us to achieve our dream of returning to the KPL, we must strengthen our squad,” Kerama noted. Kerama added: “As of now, no player has left the club and we are keen to keep all the players currently at our disposal.” He thanked Nyamira senator Okong’o Omogeni, Kitutu Masaba MP Clive Gisairo, Borabu MP Patrick Osero, and former FKF President Sam Nyamweya for pledging to help the club financially. The leaders who spoke at the burial of former chairman Nyandoro Kambi vowed to support the club. “We want to restore Shabana’s lost glory. That’s the honour we can give our chairman,” said Omogeni who donated Sh100, 000 to the club. Gisairo also donated Sh100, 000 while Osero gave Sh50, 000. Nyamweya, a former FKF president pledged Sh200, 000. “Kambi was a key pillar in Shabana. So long as there is accountability, I will continue supporting the club,” said Gisairo. Omogeni said: “We should support this club. As leaders, we should come together and support this community club.”
