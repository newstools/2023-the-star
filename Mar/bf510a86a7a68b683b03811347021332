Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has vowed to release what he has termed as details of how money was swindled from public coffers by individuals in the former regime. Gachagua who spoke during a church service in Nairobi said in the next coming days he will be releasing a detailed report on the CSs and PSs who were involved in the looting of the funds. “In the next few days, I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from the public coffers in the last three months of the last administration. I will announce the ministers and the PSs responsible so that Kenyans can know,” Gachagua said. The DP also alleged that the plan to move to the Supreme Court to challenge the declaration of William Ruto as the President-elect was a plot to get more time to empty the coffers. According to Gachagua, more than Sh24 billion was looted between the time IEBC announced Ruto as President and the day he was sworn in. “Hiyo kesi walijua hakuna mahali inaenda, ilikuwa kesi imewekwa ndio wapore mali waende,” he said. “Saa ile waliona uchaguzi imeharibika walibeba na magunia. To allow them room wakati ya Supreme Court inaskiza kesi waibe pesa ya Kenya.” (They knew the case was headed nowhere. It was a set case to ensure looting. When they realised the elections were not going on well, they carried them in sacks, to allow them room for looting when the case was ongoing). The DP hit out at the Azimio leadership over their plans to conduct a demonstration over the high cost of living. He said the Kenya Kwanza administration has been able to lower the cost of flour from Sh230 when it took over to the current Sh180.
