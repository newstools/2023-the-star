Kenya Prisons men's volleyball team recorded a 3-1 victory against Equity Bank in the Kenya Volleyball Federation league match at the Nyayo stadium on Friday. The Warders, keen to redeem their waning popularity on the courts, made it 1-0 by claiming the first set 25-23. The Bankers restored parity by grabbing the secondÂ  set 25-21 to light up the Nyayo gymnasium. A tactical change from Prison's coach David Lung'aho allowed the team to play with renewed vigor and passion. Prisons regained their advantage by winning the last two sets by an identical scoreline of 25-23. Lung'aho on Thursday had revealed to the star that their intention was to start well in the third leg. The win brought relief to the squad after the team suffered a 3-0 damaging defeat to powerhouse and defending champions the General Service Unit in their last match. The third leg of the men's league matches will be played between March 10-12
