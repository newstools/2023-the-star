Kakamega Deputy Governor Ayub Savula has told off the Azimio la Umoja leader Raila Odinga over his planned mass action drive. Savula said Raila shouldn’t expect Azimio governors and their deputies on protests, saying that will be attacking the government. “Don’t expect us at the mass action protest because President William Ruto’s government was legitimised by the Supreme Court ruling after the August 9, 2022, general elections," Savula said. "MPs and senators are the best people to engage in protests because they are the ones who oversight the government." The Azimio leader said last week that they will summon all supporters to the capital city this week for a major rally in Nairobi before heading to State House to present a petition to President Ruto. Police on Wednesday blocked all the roads leading to State House in anticipation of confrontations with Azimio supporters should Raila call for mass action. Raila had asked Ruto to find solutions to a number of issues he raised including addressing the high cost of living, opening the election servers and halting the recruitment of IEBC commissioners. The deputy governor said they already have an organised development summit chaired by the President and all 47 governors and their deputies where they lay bare their frustrations on devolution to the Head of State. “We receive cash from the government for development and the recurrent expenditure raised by Kenyan taxpayers so how do we start fighting the same government that gives us cash to serve the people,” Savula said. Savula said even development partners come through the national government so it's impractical to fight the system.
