Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has said his administration is preparing up to 29 back streets for business people in the CBD. Speaking during a church service in Roysambu, Sakaja urged small-scale traders in Nairobi CBD to continue doing business as they wait for the launch of the back streets. "We will mark the streets well, they will have good lighting and shade for rainy seasons," he said. At least 6,000 hawkers have registered with the county. “We did public participation with the hawkers and the leadership in CBD, we have marked 29 streets and back lanes that we are already preparing, Dubois road is the first one which will be the model street,” he said. Last month,  a team from the city hall started marking working areas of trading to be used by hawkers in various lanes within CBD. The exercise is spearheaded by markets director Joyce Kyengo who led the team in a tour of the various spaces. She said the governor has approved businesses set up in the back lanes. “Governor Sakaja wants small-time traders to flourish under his leadership, but he also wants order in the city. It is also to ensure they trade in a dignified manner,” Kyengo said. She said the county will instal electricity, erect sheds and improve the working conditions of the traders. Other areas earmarked for paint works include Sotik, Turkana, Posta and Kirinyaga. In October 2021, the county government invited members of the public to give their views on hawking within the CBD. In a gazette notice dated October 14, county secretary Jairus Musumba invited all interested parties including the hawkers to give their views in scheduled meetings.
