Kenya Hockey Union Secretary General Wycliffe Ongori has leapt to the defense of referees less than 10 days before the new league season starts. A section of stakeholders questioned the professionalism of some umpires last season which ended on January 29. The trend continued in the African Cup for Club Championship that ended last month in Nairobi where certain decisions left stakeholders baffled. Players and technical bench officials protested certain decisions particularly when they went against their teams. Ongori said insults won't help, adding that referees are human beings who sometimes make errors. He said parties that feel unsatisfied with the performance of officials must address their complaints appropriately. "Man is to error. Referees are human beings who sometimes make mistakes. We have also recognised that, but the only way to address it is by following the right procedure. We have a procedure to address issues." "Even the English Premier League has VAR but still lots of complaints and problems persist." At the same time, the honcho added that the final squad for the African Junior championship scheduled for March 12-19 in Ismailia, Egypt will be named anytime. There are just five days left before the competition serves off. "We intend to name the final 18 players anytime from now. We know time is not on our side but the earlier we do that the better," Ongori finalised.
