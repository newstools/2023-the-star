As the world marked International Women's Day, President William Ruto had a message for Kenyans. In his message, the President said he is proud of the progress his administration has made in ensuring the inclusion of women in leadership. He said the strides will ensure the two-thirds gender rule is achieved. President Ruto reiterated his administration's commitment to fulfilling the inclusion promise because it is critical for the development of the country. "This is the reason why I have engaged parliamentary leadership in the spirit of bipartisan patriotic collective action to explore a viable constitutional path to promote equality and inclusion in political representation," he said. He said he is also committed to eliminating all barriers that have hindered progress towards achieving gender parity. Ruto said he is counting on the support of Kenyan women to realise gender equity. "We also commit to removing systemic barriers and staying the course towards equity for all in Kenya confident that the full participation of women can help us realise the missing half of our country's national product. Happy Womenâ€™s Day." International Women's Day is marked annually on March 8 as a focal point in the women's rights movement, bringing attention to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women. This year's theme is DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality. It seeks to highlight the role of innovative technology in promoting gender equality and meeting the health and developmental needs of women and girls.
