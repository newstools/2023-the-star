Makueni governor's wife Anita Mutula has urged girls and women from the county to bridge gender skills gap through ICT training. Anita told women to embrace new technology so as to be involved in development. "As this year's theme of International Women’s Day advocates - Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality - I hope to leverage on the ICT innovation hub and community information centres across the entire county to advocate for digital literacy training of as many women and girls as possible," Anita said. She spoke during an interview with an international TV station in the country on Wednesday. Anita said she will accord even housewives a chance to undertake online jobs offered through Ajira Digital and other programmes to work from home in the near future. She believes this will reduce gender-based domestic violence as many a times it is driven by financial deprivation. Anita said in partnership with the Machakos county government, she would like to establish a high tech central hub that is user friendly to women to make them conversant with the new technologies. "In this, our girls and women will be eligible for online jobs,  Ajira Digital Jitume as has been provided by the national government geared towards ensuring our women and girls fully benefit,” Anita said. In addition, she said this will highly reduce or do away with domestic violence whose core cause is domestic poverty, now that our women will be digitally empowered. "I'm yearning for a future that will see our women and girls chase opportunities digitally, get empowered and save money,” Anita said.
