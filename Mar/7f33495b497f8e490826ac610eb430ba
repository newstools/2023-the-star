Former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero has said President William Ruto’s government shouldn’t be condemned for global events that have impacted the country’s state. Kidero said some of the problems the country is experiencing are part of a larger tide that has hit the rest of the world. He noted issues to do with climate and the economy have affected the rest of the world in a similar capacity therefore placing blame on President Ruto would be a misguided venture. “The current government is not responsible for the drought, last year we did not have the rains thus we had massive crop failures and that’s why we’re noticing hyperinflation this year,” Kidero said. "The current government is not responsible for the Russia-Ukraine conflict and all the shocks that have come with it. What Kenya is going through is part of what the global economic system is going through." He added that the government has not been in place for a long period of time and that people from all political divides should give the Kenya Kwanza government a chance and time to do its duties before making any rushed evaluations. “I think it is too early to start inducting our government. I think we need to give government time, we’re all Kenyans, just criticizing and taking a back seat will not help,” he said. Kidero further expressed support for the government’s decision to remove subsidies saying, the decision was timely and that it would help to redirect the funds being used for subsidies into production efforts. “I think we need to tighten our belts, removal of subsidies, especially on unga, you’re better off investing in the future, in production and productivity because productivity cushions the future,” he said.
