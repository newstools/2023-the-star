Dependable players Maxwell Shigali and Bob Oraye are expected to lead St Patrick’s High School Iten at this weekend’s Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association  (KSSSA) Elgeyo Marakwet county games. The event will serve as a qualifier for the national secondary schools' games. The rugby 15's head coach Barnard Indasi is optimistic the duo will guide the team to the national championship after dominating the Keiyo North sub-county games last weekend. “We have a strong team and we expect them to dominate the county games. Our target is to qualify for the national games,” said Indasi. The two-day event that kicks off on Friday will end on Saturday with the return of schools' rugby 15s. Iten will bank on home advantage to see off their opponents in the event that has attracted four sub-counties. Two teams will represent the county at the nationals. “By virtue of being the rugby 15s hosts, we hope to take advantage of home ground to dominate the event ahead of the nationals in April,” said Indasi. Indasi guided his former school Simotwo Boys to the national games in 2017 in rugby 15s while the Sevens team managed to play at the nationals in 2014 and 2015 unlike Iten, who last featured at the nationals in 15s in 2009. “We want to play at the nationals this year because it has been a while. We have improved in all areas with the two players, Shigali and Oraye enjoying top form,”  he added. Iten beat Tambach High 26-0 in the final to win the Keiyo North title and advance to the county level. The county games will have schools from hosts Keiyo North, Keiyo South, Marakwet East and Marakwet West. “We are supposed to have eight teams but I am told Marakwet West does not have a team at the games,” he said. While Iten will host rugby 15s, hockey, basketball and athletics will be staged at the Tambach School. Iten will also stage a cross-country meeting while handball and other matches will be hosted at Tambach.
