More than 800 illegal water points have been disconnected and at least 40 suspects arrested in Nairobi in an operation led by Water PS Paul Rono. On Friday, 500 illegal water connections were disconnected in Kibera, Lang'ata. The exercise, which started Friday morning, was temporarily disrupted after some youths started pelting security officers with stones. However, the protesters were overpowered, paving the way for the drive to proceed. The crackdown dubbed Lipa Maji, Tunza Maji started on February 16. The PS said 800 illegal water points have been disconnected since the operation started. Rono said Lang'ata and its environs have not been getting water due to illegal connections. The PS said illegal connections have deprived water to around 5,000 households in Ngei. He said half of the 560,000 cubic metres of water supplied to the city is unaccounted for. "Every drop counts. We have to ensure there is proper usage and payments are fully made," he said. He praised the Water Police Unit, saying they have done a tremendous job. Rono said several projects have been rolled out to enhance water supply to the city. The PS said the Karimenu dam, set to be commissioned soon, will enhance water supply by 70,000 cubic metres per day, with Nairobi getting 23,000 cubic metres per day. He said the remaining water will be supplied to Ruiru residents as rivers serving them have dried up. TheÂ Northern Collector Tunnel will supply the bulging population in the city with a further 140,000 cubic metres a day. This, the PS said, will boost the city's supply to close to 700,000 cubic metres against a demand of almost 800,000. The PS said the fight against illegal water connections will not be easy. He said it needs cooperation and teamwork from everyone. The PS said any illegal water connection will attract a fine of Sh100,000. However, the judge has discretion. Rono urged water vendors to register for authorities to know their water sources. The crackdown takes place even as water levels in Ndakaini continue to decline at am alarming rate. By March 8, the levels were at 44.7 per cent, which equals to 31.3 million cubic metres. The worrying decline is because some rivers that drain to the dam have dried up, with authorities hoping that the skies will soon open up. The dam produces 430,000m3 per day of water, about 84 per cent of the total water supply to Nairobi residents. It remains the main supplier of water to Nairobi, which has a population of 4.3 million as of the 2019 census. Statistical projections estimate the city's population will hit 10 million by 2030, further straining the water supply. Nairobi City Water and Sewage Company is currently producing 525,000 cubic metres per day against a demand of 850 million litres per day, leaving a shortfall of 325 million litres. Out of the water supplied, 300,000 cubic metres are lost on a daily basis through leaks also known as non-revenue water (unaccounted water).
