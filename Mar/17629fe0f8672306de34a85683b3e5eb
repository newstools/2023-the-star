The curtains for the 2023 Kenya Cup final will be brought down this Saturday as hosts Kabras Sugar take on KCB at the Kakamega showground. There have been 15 previous Kenya cup meetings between Kabras Sugar and KCB, including five finals. The finals in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 have all gone in KCB's favour. KCB also won the title in 2005, 2006 and 2007 to take their total trophy tally to eight. Defending champions Kabras have won two finals (2016 and 2022). Kabras have played twice against KCB at their Kakamega showground field -winning and drawing one match apiece. KCB has never lost against Kabras at the Lion's Den, Ruaraka. Unbeaten Kabras, toppled the league phase of the competition this season. KCB was runner-up after suffering their only loss against their bitter rivals Kabras. The final is being held in Kakamega because Kabras was the highest-ranked team in the regular season. That alone guaranteed the team a home semifinal where they beat Harlequins 22-8. Kabras beat KCB 29-23 on match-day 10 last month in Ruaraka but the finals will be a different ball game altogether.
