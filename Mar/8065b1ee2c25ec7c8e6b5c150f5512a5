Kenya Under-21 women's hockey team head coach Meshack Senge says he is banking on his experience in the recent Africa Cup for Club Champions to make the podium in the upcoming Junior event. This comes after the Kenya Hockey Union selected both the men's and women's U21 sides that will represent the country in the Africa  Junior Cup of Nations in Ismailia, Egypt from March 12-19. Senge, who doubles up as the Strathmore University's Scorpions women's hockey team coach, expressed optimism about his players' physical condition. ‘My players continued to train even after the Africa Cup for Club Champions and they are generally looking good although we were short on build-up matches. We are hoping to play Zimbabwe before departing," said Senge. The tactician promised to take the tourney with the seriousness it deserves and tackle a game at a time. "The selection of the players was very competitive and I believe we have tried to have a good balance. We could not have done anything differently or better," he added. Kenya last participated in the tournament in 2008  before skipping the 2019 edition. This is the first time in a very long time the country will be participating. The event has also attracted hosts Egypt, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. Given that they are making their competition debut, the Kenyan squad will study the competitors before playing them. 'There are no big or small teams in these competitions. We have to look closely at them to figure out their style of play. We simply can't afford to underrate any team and that is why I have said we will put our best forward," concluded Senge. As a result of his team's outstanding performance in January, coach Senge was awarded the StarTimes Coach of the Month award.
