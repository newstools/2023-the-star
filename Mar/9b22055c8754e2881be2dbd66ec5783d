Ulinzi Starlets coach Joseph Mwanza believes there's more to come from attacking sensation Fasila Adhiambo after scoring on her debut on Saturday. The soldiers beat tail-enders Kayole Starlets 5-0 in the Women's Premier League match at Ulinzi Sports complex on Saturday. This was the last match before the second leg next weekend. Adhiambo who was signed by Kangemi Ladies within the week made an instant impact by scoring the fourth goal. The 20-year-old was last season's runner-up top scorer with 15 goals. Mwanza said there's a lot that needs to be done for the raw talent to realise her potential adding that he is relieved the striker found the back of the net at the first time of asking. "She is not the finished article yet but her talent is evident. I am happy she scored her first goal in Ulinzi colours. We went all-out for her signature because we knew she will add another dimension to the already star-studded attack," he said. Lucie Nato grabbed a brace while Cindy Ngaira and Mercy Airo scored the other goals. Ulinzi has scored 12 goals in two matches. Last weekend they silenced Kangemi 7-0. Mwanza said beating Zetech Sparks next weekend is high on their agenda. "We want to start the second leg with victory. Adhiambo has what it takes to become a top striker in the country."
