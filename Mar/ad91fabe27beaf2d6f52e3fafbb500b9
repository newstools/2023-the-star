Lawyer Miguna Miguna has vehemently opposed a potential Handshake between president William Ruto and former interior CS Fred Matiang'i. In a tweet, Miguna while reacting to a media report hinting at the possibility of Ruto and Matiang'i reconciling termed it as tragic and a horrible mistake if it happens. Miguna said that people who voted for Ruto and deputy President Rigathi Gachagua do not like Matiang'i. "If true, this would be a tragic and horrible mistake. The millions of Kenyans who voted for Ruto⁩ and ⁦Gachagua hate Fred Matiang’i and everything he represents," he said. The reaction by Miguna came amidst reports that a series of meetings held between Kisii leaders, the president and others with his allies brokered a deal for Matiangí release by DPP Noordin Haji. On Sunday, Matiang'i and Education CS Ezekiel Machogu on Sunday met at an undisclosed hotel in Karen. However, details of the meeting were not disclosed. President William Ruto is expected to tour the Kisii region where the two leaders hail from. Machogu described the meeting as normal leaders meeting. "There was nothing much, just a normal leaders meeting," he said in a text message. Matiang'i has recently hit news headlines after an alleged home raid that police denied. On Tuesday last week, Matiang'i presented himself before the DCI after being summoned. The DCI had recommended that the former CS be charged with conspiracy to commit a felony contrary to section 393 of the Penal Code. They also wanted him charged with the Publication of false information contrary to section 23 of the Computer and Misuse and Cybercrime Act No. 5 of 2018. However, the DPP directed DCI to close the file without any further police action. "The evidence provided did not meet the ingredients needed to prove each of the afore-mentioned offences as required by law," he added.
