Diamond Platnumz has praised Alikiba over his song 'Asali'. The WCB singer shared an Instagram story listening to the song through a streaming platform and said that was his best Alikiba song. Diamond has for the longest time been pitted against Alikiba as music rivals. Fans have appreciated Diamond for being the big person and showing love to his rival. Last year, Diamond also gave flowers to Harmonize and Alikiba for sharing their talent with the world. "Who doesn't know Harmonize and Alikiba are big and talented artistes?" he asked. Adding, "Tanzanians like it when you die in your career. When they see an artiste making it in the industry, they create beef with other artistes, which is not, good according to me."
