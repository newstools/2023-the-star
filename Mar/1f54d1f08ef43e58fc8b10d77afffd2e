Former state officials said to have looted the public coffers will be named and prosecuted, UDA secretary general Cleophas Malala Malala said the 'well-known' individuals are going to be arrested once Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua makes the report public. "Once they are made known we shall go after them, we are not just revealing who they are, they are going to be arrested," he said. "Even if they run or hide that money because we know some have started panicking we shall not spare them." The SG stated that the government will also pursue the money which he argued may have been stashed in foreign banks by the particular individuals. He noted the demonstrations being organised by the opposition are well-calculated to divert the government from the course but stated they are going to remain focused. Gachagua vowed to name the particular state officials. He vehemently claimed that some senior government officials stole billions of money days before the Kenya Kwanza administration took over power last September. He was speaking on Friday when he met professionals from Nyeri. The officials, he said, raided the government coffers as the Supreme Court case against their victory was going on. "Money was stolen from Covid when people were dying. Two days before the elections they stole Sh6 billion. When there was a case before the Supreme Court, they stole another Sh10 billion purportedly to pay some contractors," he said. The Deputy President added that the stolen money was taken to the officials' homes. "Money was brought in cartons from Wilson Airport and flown in choppers to people's homes," he added.
