Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua has come out to defend the move to allow foreign missions to get in touch directly with ministries and state agencies. He explained that the latest directive will ease his work and enhance quick service delivery. Additionally, the CS said many opportunities have been lost due to bureaucracies which he termed as elitist-based. "As CS for Foreign and Diaspora affairs, I have been bothered by many pending MOUs and lost opportunities due to traditional and mostly elitist-based bureaucracy. After talks with the diplomatic community, I have issued the following notice for Chap Chap interactions," he said. In a letter dated March 1, Mutua allowed foreign missions to get in touch with working ministries without going through his office. Initially, all foreign missions had to engage with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which would then make the link to working ministries in the country. The move elicited mixed reactions as some felt he was being stripped of his power. Renown lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi said he has no confidence in the Mutua following the move. "This is a huge, huge, huge, vote of no confidence in CS Mutua! If it were me, I would resign at once, " Abdullahi said. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations had entrusted all official business with the receiving State to be conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
