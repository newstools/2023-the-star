The Enterprise Cup is the oldest and longest-running competition in Kenyan rugby. First played in 1930, it  is also one of the oldest competitions in Kenyan sport. The Enterprise Cup was originally an annual 15s rugby competition played between sides from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. It is now a 15s rugby knock-out competition for top Kenyan club sides. The original cup was donated by sailors from the HMS Enterprise who had toured East Africa in 1928. However, the competition has had setbacks and failed to take place in various seasons due to various reasons. It was shelved between 1940–1946 due to World War II as well as in 1987, where it paved way for an international competition at the RFUEA ground as part of the fourth All Africa Games. The event was also omitted from the KRU roaster for the 2011/2012 season while the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020-2021 necessitated the cancellation of the season.
