Reigning champions National Cereals and Produce Board beat Black Mamba 27-17 in a crucial Kenya Handball Federation league clash at Nyayo National Stadium. The win puts the unbeaten millers in the driving seat with one match to go. The millers have 34 points against second-placed Ulinzi who have 30 points. The soldiers have two matches to go and will face off against fifth-placed Strathmore University and a final fixture against leaders NCPB. "As of now, NCPB have a goal aggregate of 325 as compared to Ulinzi who have 217. The true picture will be known after Ulinzi play Strathmore next week," said KHF league coordinator George Asimeto. "The scenario is, if Ulinzi wins both games against Strathmore and NCPB on the last day, the title will be decided on goal aggregate as both teams will have lost one match." In that epic encounter against Mamba, NCPB took a close 11-8 lead at half-time before pushing that margin 16-9  at the break. Captain Timothy Kirimi notched seven goals, Brian Walacha bagged six and Nicholas Okore shot four for the winners. Mamba, who had promised to give a good fight, had five from Morgan Juma while Martin Nguli and Charles Malenya hit three each. Buccaneers hit Nairobi City County 25-23 as Randy Ochieng shot six goals and Arnold Kiplagat five. The losers had 9 from Jim Corolla. NCPB women also kept their push to the top with an easy 40-16 victory over Amazon. They were up 20-7 at intermission. The win puts them in third position with 32 points, the same as second-placed Ulinzi Sharks. Leaders Nairobi Water Queens are top with 34 and had a late game against Amazon. Sarah Mabonga scored 11 goals, Purity Nyawira five while Joan Akinyi and Adda Musilibi added four each. Valine Akoth made the losers' eight. Amazon posted two wins the previous day, whipping NCC 44-17 and  Rising Star 63-32.
