First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto has said the government aims to strengthen the family unit. Mama Rachel spoke on Sunday in Meru where she had attended a church service. She said her Faith diplomacy office aims to spread the praying culture to the rest of the nation., That the new regime got into power through the power of prayer. " We have our faith diplomacy office, where we want to take prayers to the rest of the nation. We have a prayer program where we are saying family values must be protected," she said. I would like us to pray on matters of family. The family has become an institution that has been very much attacked. If the mother and father are not peacefully together, then the children will have problems." Mama Rachel said many children are getting lost in worldly pleasures because families are no longer stable. "Thus, we will stand with families through prayers and by visiting schools to preach the word of God, "she said. The First Lady said that if children are taught prayer and the word of God early enough in life, they will not let go of it as they grow. She said the LGBTQ debate is threatening the family structure. "We want to strengthen the family institution where we have a father, a mother and children. LGBTQ is forbidden even in the Bible and the African culture. Let us hold on to family values," she said.
