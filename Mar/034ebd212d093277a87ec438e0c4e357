Socialite Vera Sidika has not welcomed her second child as was earlier reported. Through her Instagram page, Vera rubbished the claims, although she said she is almost due. A fan asked her if it was true she had given birth. Vera said being a celebrity is very tough as people can report anything about you. "They said the same thing when I was still pregnant with Asia. They even looked for random baby pictures and claimed that was my baby," she told her fans. On Thursday last week, Vera announced that she had held an exquisite white, gold, and earthy undertones gender reveal party. A few hours later, it was reported that she had already given birth and that the videos were a misdirect. Vera is well-learned when it comes to the act of clout chasing and showbiz. According to Nairobi News, Vera gave birth a few days ago but hasn't yet announced the arrival of her baby boy with Brown Mauzo because of the reality show she is currently starring in. 'Real Housewives Of Nairobi' cast member Lisa Christoffersen let the cat out of the bag. Asked why the other reality show members did not show up for the screening, Lisa replied by revealing that Sonal was out of the country while the "Popstar" singer had just welcomed her new bundle of joy. “Vera could have been here, but she just had a baby. Sonal Merali is away in India on family matters,” Lisa candidly replied. Vera's episode of her gender reveal party will be aired on Showmax on the next episode of the reality show.
