 The US International Development Finance Corporation will put up more windmills in Kajiado county to increase the megawatts of the country’s power grid. The US Ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman, told the Star in Kajiado county on Friday that IDFC invested more than USD200 million in Kipeto Wind Farm. She said they will soon open up the project by putting up two more phases to increase the current 100 megawatts it is producing. “I am happy to announce that in renewable energy, Kenya is a leader and in the top of five or 10 countries of the world, including America,” said Whitman. Whitman said, with about 90 per cent achieved in renewable energy, Kenya is ahead of many other countries of the world. She said with the current climate change, wind power and geothermal production of electric energy are the ways to go. The ambassador, who was touring the American-funded power plant in Kipeto, said the two more phases planned for expansion will more than triple the production of electric power. She said with the enhanced production, Kajiado will be connected to the country’s main grid.
