Defence Cabinet secretary Aden Duale on Saturday weighed in on Azimio leader Raila Odinga's mass action protests. Duale who was speaking at Manar Islamic Center said the current street protests and attacks on president William Ruto are meant to confuse. According to Duale, they are just trying to cover up for what he termed as mistakes they did during the last regime. Said the Ruto administration is not threatened by the protests terming them the last kicks of a dying horse. “What makes Raila unease in the last seven months is because he knows the wrongs he committed against the people of Kenya and the economy in the last two years of the handshake," he said. “And so all the noise you see coming from him and his ilk are not for the interest of Kenyans. But Kenyans are very smart and can read between the lines. We tell them that enough is enough." Garissa township MCA Hussein Dagane called on the youth not to be misused by self-seeking politicians calling on them to rise above petty politics. “My appeal to my fellow youth is not to accept to be used by politicians who are pushing them to the streets. At the end of the day you will be left on your own. Your question should be, how are those street protests helping you as an individual,” he said. On Friday, the Azimio leader while speaking in Migori said that the march to electoral justice is unstoppable. The Azimio La Umoja one Kenya protests entered the second day on Friday in the lead up to the planned major procession in Nairobi on March 20. He said that the new movement for defence and democracy would spearhead the boycott and organize rallies across the country. He told president Ruto and the Kenya Kwanza administration to brace themselves for tough times as Azimio enhances their street protests.
