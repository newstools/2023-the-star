World football has gathered in Kigali, Rwanda this week for the 73rd Fifa Congress, which doubles up as the presidential elective assembly. The Congress will happen on Thursday at the BK Arena in Kigali with Fifa president Gianni Infantino and his CAF counterpart Patrice Motsepe already in Kigali. Before the Congress, a series of activities will take place including the Fifa Council meeting that will take place on Tuesday at the Marriott hotel in Kigali from 2.30pm. The meeting will, however, be closed to the media. There will be a delegation football tournament on Wednesday at 2pm at the Nyamirambo Kigali Stadium with further details set to follow in due course. CAF president Motsepe is set to confer the CAF president’s outstanding achievement award to Rwanda president Paul Kagame and the King Mohammed VI of Morocco on Wednesday evening at the Serena hotel. Motsepe will be joined by a number of football legends. Thursday’s main agenda remains the 73rd Congress followed by a press conference that will be attended by Infantino. At the same time, Fifa has announced it supported Rwanda’s brand-new accommodation centre to the tune of USD 4.7 million through its Fifa Forward Program. Made up of 42 bedrooms, two dining rooms, several offices and two large meeting rooms, this functional complex, which is still in a development phase, will be used to host the entire Amavubi (The Wasps) family — be it the men’s, women’s or youth teams – during national gatherings. It will also open its doors to any Ferwafa guests during meetings or workshops. “It’s a source of pride for the Kigali Regional Office to have supported Ferwafa in the construction of this superb building,” explained Davis Ndayisenga, Manager of Fifa’s Regional Development Office, which was officially opened in Kigali almost a year ago to the day. “It’s a unique residential centre that will enable the Federation to embark on other projects in the future.”
