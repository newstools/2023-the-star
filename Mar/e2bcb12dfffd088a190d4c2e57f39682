Three police officers charged with robbery with violence have a case to answer, a court has ruled. Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto found that Gideon Sumare, Kevin Omerikwa and Shallan Ouma will face the bench. They were charged with violently robbing a businessman of Sh150,000. They all denied the charges. Prosecutors said the three Recce Squad officers were accused of robbing George Olang' using force and threats on September 8, 2020, along the Eastern Bypass in Embakasi, Nairobi county. The trio had also accused of demanding money by menacing him. The complainant brother had also testified in court and narrated  how his brother called and informed him of the robbery. “My brother called me and urged me to send him Sh80,000 because he had been held ransom, I sent him the money and also advised him to report the issue to the nearest police station,” he told the court. The matter had been reported at the Kiambu police station under OB number 27/17/6/2020. Olang' handed the officers a photo of the person they were looking for. While testifying in court on Thursday during their defence, they jointly denied the wrongdoing and said that they never participated in the robbery. For instance, the third accused person, Shalla Oooro Ouma, told the court by the time the incident occurred he was attached to former Deputy President William Ruto’s office in Karen. He told the court he never knew why he was arraigned and he never knew the car used in the robbery. The cops are currently out on Sh500,000 bond with an alternative cash bail of Sh200,000. Senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto directed that the cops come back in court on April 15 when a judgment will be delivered.  (Edited by V. Graham)
