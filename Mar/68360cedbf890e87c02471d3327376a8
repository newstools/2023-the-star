The Cabinet Secretary for Education Ezekiel Mochogu has said Sh100 million has been set aside to rebuild schools destroyed by bandits in Turkana. Mochogu spoke in Turkana while assessing the impact of the prolonged drought on education and the possible mitigation measures to keep learning going on. He was accompanied by his counterpart Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano for East African Community, ASALs, and Regional Development. They led the distribution of food items to learners and hunger-stricken families in Turkana. The prolonged drought has affected the transition rates in schools due to the lack of food and water for animals and people. The CS said Sh100 million will be used to rebuild 13 schools that were burnt by suspected Pokot bandits. Mochogu said the government will ensure learning is returned to normalcy in the banditry regions. “We have put aside Sh100 million to rebuild schools that were burnt by bandits, the leadership here (Turkana) should now have contractors on standby,” Mochogu said. Mochogu also pledged his commitment to ensuring the school feeding program is back in Turkana county to attract learners to school. “We also have money for the school feeding program, I assure you my commitment to ensuring food is available by next week in all schools here,” he said.
