Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has distanced himself and President William Ruto from Kenya Kwanza affiliate parties merger. According to the DP, the merger calls by UDA secretary general Cleophas Malala is just his way of ensuring the party is strong. Gachagua said their intention is also not to force anyone to fold their parties to join the ruling party. "That is Malala idea of making UDA a strong party. He's an energetic young man and I have all the time for him. Probably his style is different but we don’t want to coerce anyone to fold their party, but if anyone feels the need they can fold and join," he said. His remarks come at the backdrop of calls by Malala to have all Kenya Kwanza allied parties join the ruling UDA to be one. Malala insists that Kenya Kwanza is seeking to form one formidable party that will outlive its current leadership. He said that there is no reason to continue having parties for the purposes of elections only. "Off late we had coalitions of convenience whereby people come together for purposes of winning an election, they don't believe or like each other and have no common agenda, they just come together for purposes of winning an election," he said. "That is why coalitions have been unable to sustain themselves post-election." Malala has been pushing for the dissolution of affiliates in Kenya Kwanza ahead of the 2027 political showdown with Azimio.
