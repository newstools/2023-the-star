President William Ruto has warned foremen who will handle the affordable housing project in Starehe not to frustrate women who will go looking for casual employment. Speaking on Monday during the groundbreaking ceremony of the 6,700 housing units, Ruto said he received reports that women are being frustrated while looking for jobs. "Vile tumeambiwa hapa, kina mama wengi ambao wanafanya kazi kwa construction sites, kuna watu wanawapatia mateso. Sijui nitakupatia date, sijui nitakupatia nini. Mama amekuja kutafuta kazi hajakuja kutafuta date," Ruto said. (We have been told here that most women who work in construction sites are being frustrated. They're being told they will be taken out for dates; a mother has come looking for a job, not a date) The President said the government is keen on ensuring women play a bigger role in the affordable housing programme which envisions constructing 200,000 housing units annually. He said in order to preserve their dignity, sufficient ablution blocks should be constructed by the contractor handling the Starehe project. "And I want to ask the Ministry of Lands and Housing, you must be deliberate about engaging women in the construction industry," he said. The Starehe housing project is the first where women masons under the Build Her project will handle most of the work. Ruto said all the casual work should go to residents of Ziwani in Starehe, the majority of whom should be women. "We have agreed with the contractor that all paintwork, plumbing and electrical work should be given to women," Ruto said.
