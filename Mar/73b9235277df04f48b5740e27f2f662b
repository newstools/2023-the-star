Lawyers representing former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i in relation to the alleged police raid at his Karen home say they almost came to blows with DCI officers during his grilling on Tuesday. Lawyer Dastan Omari told the media shortly after the six-hour grilling session that DCI officers wanted to take a mugshot of Matiang'i with the crimes he is alleged to have committed. The lawyers vehemently objected to this, Omari said. "They tried to get that famous DCI logo of petty thieves to put on the CS, we objected vehemently and almost exchanged blows. It's not provided for under any law," Omari said. The High Court on December 6, 2018, barred the Inspector General of Police and DCI's office from posting mugshots of suspects on social media before they are arraigned. Omari said the only question that is still lingering on their heads on when the former powerful Interior CS will be arraigned. The DCI has preferred two counts against him; conspiracy to commit a felony and publication of false information. Omari, however, said it's not yet clear when the police intend to present him in court. "They said they are not taking waziri (Minister) to court today. So what then remains is that it is a date they will present the charge sheet before the court and we shall present Waziri before that court," he said. He alleged that the date of arraignment will not come from the DCI. "The snug word you are seeing push and pull is that a date must be given by somebody somewhere outside when they will take to court." Matiang'i's trouble with the law enforcers emanates from the events of the night of February 8 when his lawyer Omari claimed his Karen home had been raided by a battalion of officers from the elite wing of the DCI. Police officers and all other arresting authorities including the KRA and EACC denied ever having set foot at the home. Matiang'i's home would later on February 15 be broken into by DCI officers reportedly to retrieve the CCTV footage of the alleged raid.
