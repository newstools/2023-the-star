Bronze medalist Wiseman Were says he not only wants to compete at this year’s World Athletics Championships in Budapest but also shine at the Olympics and African Championships. Were, who placed fourth in the men's 400m hurdles race at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, says he wants to run fast times to win the competition. Were said: ''My ultimate goal is to compete in Budapest. I have to work hard for it and it is a step-by-step process. It starts with the African Championships, Commonwealth Games, and All African Games before transforming to the Diamond League and Olympic Games.'' The medalist is hopeful despite not winning the gold at the Commonwealth Games and hopes to capitalise on the failure as a motivation to become even better. “I thank God because it was my first indoor race and I did well but due to some challenges I finished fourth. The experience was enlightening as it was an eye-opener for me,” he said. The bronze medalist believes by the fast times being set around the globe is a message for Kenyans to up their game. He set his goal even lower this year after clocking 49.09 seconds in the 400m hurdles last year. “My target this year is to run under 49 seconds in the 400m hurdles. I am targeting 48 or 47 seconds this year,” said Were. Were clocked in 20.97 seconds in the men's 200m race at the second Athletics Kenya track and field meeting, which was held in February at Nyayo Stadium. "I was here to build my speed in the 200m race to help me run even faster in the 400m hurdles and qualify for the World Championships," said the athlete. He is looking forward to the third leg of the Athletics Kenya track and field meeting which is set to take place in Thika this weekend. Meanwhile, the 19th edition of the World Athletics Championships is scheduled to be held from August 19-27 in Budapest, Hungary.
