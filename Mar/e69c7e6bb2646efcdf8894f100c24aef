Swimming is a popular water-based activity and sport that involves moving through water using a combination of arm and leg movements. Often done in rivers, lakes, oceans and swimming pools. Human beings have been swimming since the dawn of time. Take for example the Bajau tribe of Indonesia, who are known for their exceptional swimming and diving abilities, they use this skill in spearfishing. Let's highlight some of the benefits of this calorie-blasting activity. Swimming is a great way to get a full-body workout, as it engages all of the major muscle groups, including the arms, shoulders, back, chest, core, hips, and legs, providing a full-body workout. This, in turn, develops and sculpts one's physique making their muscles appear toned and highlighted. Second, swimming is an excellent form of cardiovascular exercise, which means it can help to improve heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. It involves lots of large muscle groups working together simultaneously and continuously, which requires your heart to work hard to pump oxygen throughout your body, giving you a thorough workout. Swimming can help to improve flexibility and range of motion, as the water provides a low-resistance environment that allows for a greater range of motion compared to other forms of exercise. As joints are moved they become more flexible due to the motion they are exposed to. This activity can help to increase lung capacity and improve respiratory function, as it requires controlled breathing and can help to strengthen the respiratory muscles. When your heart rate climbs during a tough workout, that’s a response to your body’s need for more oxygen. That oxygen is supplied by your lungs. Lastly, swimming can be a relaxing and meditative activity that can help reduce stress and anxiety since one typically enjoys this activity hence gloominess is reduced. Overall a good swimming exercise routine would surely do your body a lot of good.
