Ekenyoro Technical Secondary School basketball coach Festus Segera is confident of retaining the Nyamira county boys title. Speaking after retaining their Nyamira South sub-county trophy, Segera said: “I have faith in the team. The boys' morale is high and we are raring to go. At the regional level, we are targeting the semifinals because last time we were eliminated in the first round.” At the sub-county level, Ekenyoro beat former champions Nyansabakwa 38-17 to lift the title. In the semis, Ekenyoro eliminated St Joseph’s Kemasare 51-15 while Nyansabakwa overcame Gesiaga 34-19. In the girls' category, both Sironga Girls and Ekenyoro Technical will represent the sub-county at the county championships. The final between the two schools was not played due to heavy rains. In the semis, Ekenyoro defeated Our Lady of Mercy, Rangenyo 22-8 as Sironga overcame Kemasare 38-17. Ekenyoro has been handed an easy draw at the county level where they will face Mokomoni and Machururiati in Pool ‘A’ while Pool ‘B’ will have Biticha, Matongo, and Mwongori. Hosts St Kizito Nyansiongo, Nyambaria, Nyairang’a and Nyansabakwa are in Pool ‘C’. In the girls' category, Sironga, Gekano, and Mwongori are in Pool ‘A’ while Pool ‘B’ has Mokomoni, Kiabonyoru, and Biticha. Pool ‘C’ has Nyairang’a, Rigoma, Manga Girls and Ekerenyo. At the same time, the Nyamira county Term One Games earlier scheduled for this weekend have been postponed to March 22 at St Kizito, Nyansiongo High School. Meanwhile, the Kisii County Championships will be held at Kisii School and Kisii University on March 22 -25, according to Geoffrey Nyantika, the Kisii County Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association secretary. “All the sub-counties are concluding their events by Friday in readiness for the county championships,” Nyantika said.
