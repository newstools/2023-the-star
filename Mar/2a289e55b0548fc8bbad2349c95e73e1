Three people were on Saturday killed in Kisii over a suspected land-related conflict. Several houses were also torched during the incident. Police said an enraged mob attacked Haron Omweri's home and set a house ablaze. Two people were killed inside and one more was killed outside as he attempted to flee. Police said one farm hand was rushed to hospital with critical injuries. Two more houses were also torched after the efforts by the farm hands to repulse the mobs with arrows failed. Nyamache police boss Kipkulei Kemboi said they suspect a prolonged land conflict as the probable cause of the killings. "Our officers have commenced investigations and will give additional briefings later," he told the Star. By Saturday evening, officers were still cordoning off the property to stem further destruction. Nyamache deputy county commissioner Esther Maina said investigations have begun. "I cannot disclose many details as of now as investigations are still underway," she said on phone.
