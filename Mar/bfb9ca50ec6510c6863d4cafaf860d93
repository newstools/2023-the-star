Strathmore University Blades coach Tony Ochieng has his eyes set on the  KBF Premier League play-offs. Ochieng tipped his boys to finish not lower than in the fourth position in this year's league.  Blades are currently third on the log with 32 points and have two matches in hand. Blades have yet to play rivals, the University of Nairobi 'Terrorists' and Africa Nazarene University "Wolfpacks" in fixtures that will not change his overall standing. "I still have two matches to play. But no matter the results, we will find finish our regular season in the top four slots," said Ochieng. He said his focus now remains on the playoffs and his team will be well-prepared when the postseason games start. "We have hit our target as a team and we are just waiting for the next phase of the league. The only problem remains the uncertainty surrounding kick-off." He said he has rotated his boys well in all positions so far and they will be ready for whatever is thrown at them. "This year, I've got enough cover in all three positions. It is good growth for the team and they have the confidence to play anyone," he offered. Ochieng said he will use Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) games to fine-tune the squad ahead of the playoffs. "After our regular season matches, we will review our performance and my plan is to play at least two friendly matches against top teams. "Equity Bank and Ulinzi Warriors occupy the top two positions in the league with 34 points each from 19 matches.
