Kakamega Governor Fernandes Barasa has said his decision to work with the Kenya Kwanza government was purely on development matters. Speaking on Friday, the county boss said he was following his predecessors who brought development to Kakamega as a result of working with the national government. “It's a must we work with the government of the day. My predecessor Oparanya has a development record because he also worked closely with former President Uhuru Kenyatta, even when he was the Council of Governors chairman,” Barasa added. Early this week, Barasa told off his predecessor Wycliffe Oparanya, insisting county chiefs must work with the national government for the sake of development. The governor regretted that Oparanya was telling governors allied to the Azimio coalition to shun President William Ruto's administration yet he worked closely with retired head of state Uhuru Kenyatta. Barasa fired back at Oparanya over his recent attacks on governors whom he said are fond of visiting State House yet they have enough resources to realise development without partnering with Ruto's government. Going further, Governor Barasa emphasized that his engagement with President William Ruto was purely for the good of Kakamega residents. Barasa noted that the law allows county governments to collaborate with a national government. “So when you see me collaborating with William Ruto, the engagement is purely for development.  We are all serving the same people. It is our right to work with the national government for development,” he said. The Governor added that his administration had put politics behind them as it was time to work and deliver for Kakamega residents. “Issues of politics we are finished and now it's time to work. Those who have started early election politics, I’m telling them to come slowly,” Barasa added.
