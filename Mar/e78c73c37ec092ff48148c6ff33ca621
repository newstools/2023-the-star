Police are investigating an incident in which a man was subjected to mob injustice in Machakos on Thursday for allegedly stealing two chickens from a villager’s house. The 4.30 pm incident was reported to Kathiani police station as a mob injustice incident report. Police said the incident was reported to the station by a watchman who works at Ithaeni market. “The watchman reported he got information from a bodaboda operator that there was a scene of mob injustice at Kyangii village. Officers from Kathiani police station led by the OCS and DCI team visited the scene and established that one unknown African male aged about 25 years was burnt by angry members of the public and succumbed to the injuries,” a police report seen by the Star read. Police said the suspect was killed after he was found to have broken into a woman’s house and stolen two chickens. The woman is said to have been away. “One Mutua Mwatu screamed for help and the public responded and burnt the suspect using tyres and firewood. The suspect succumbed to injuries,” police said in the report. The scene was processed by the officers and the body was moved to Machakos Level 5 Hospital mortuary. The DCI has since launched a probe into the incident after opening an inquest file NO: 3/2023.
