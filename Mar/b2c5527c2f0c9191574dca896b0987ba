Siaya Governor James Orengo has hit out at President William Ruto , telling him to open the election servers if he believes he won the elections. The governor also blasted Ruto over making endless promises about improving the lives of Kenyans, insisting that time for pledges are over. “If you are sure you won the elections, in God's name, why are you afraid to open the servers,” Orengo said claiming the servers have the truth that Raila Odinga won the elections. 'If you believe you won the elections, the servers will tell us the truth.” President Ruto has said the demands to open the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission servers are unlawful. Orengo claimed that President Ruto is taking Kenyans for a ride without a clear plan on how to turn around the economy and save citizens from poverty. Orengo, who only in January hosted Ruto in Siaya county where they launched several development projects, said it is Raila who will save the country. He warned those betraying Raila, saying the opposition leader will soon cross the River Jordan, to the promised land. “Raila is taking us to the promised land and he is going to the promised land with his people and he will do better than King Martin Luther ….we will cross river Jordan to Canaan,” he said. The governor was speaking during the burial of Luo Council of Elders Willis Otondi in Nyahera, Kisumu county.
