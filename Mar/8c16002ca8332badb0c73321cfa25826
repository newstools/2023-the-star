Nigerian singer Lojay, famed for his hit song 'Monalisa', has released his 'Gangster Romantic' EP. Disclosing his intentions with the new EP, the singer said he didn't make it because he wanted to have hits. "I wanted people to listen to something they can connect with and hold onto for a long time," he said. "Of course, you want to do numbers and be on the charts, but that isnâ€™t the point. "All I ask is that you listen to the project from beginning to end as one full body of work. "There is a reason why I placed all of the songs where they are. I want you to have that experience in unison and just take it in and connect."
