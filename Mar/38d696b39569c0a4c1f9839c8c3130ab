Social media influencer Xtian Dela whose real name is Arthur Mandela has been the talk of social media all through Sunday morning. He was a top trend after a video of his mother, Reverend Naomi Nyongesa, emerged saying she has not set eyes on her son for the past four years. Dela's mother is an actress who has featured in the hilarious Hullabaloo Estate show as the wife of Ondiek'. She said Dela started disappearing in 2019. "His name is Arthur Mandela Nyongesa. Arthur was born in 1990. From 2019, he started disappearing. Whenever I told him to come home, he would not come as much, saying he is very busy," she said. Nyongesa said her son cut ties with her to the extent that he blocked her from reaching him through the phone. " Since then, he went silent, and I have never heard from him. It happened that he had cut me off, even blocked me. It is then that I saw it fit to appeal, wherever Arthur is, he should know his mother wants him," an almost teary Nyongesa said. "It is painful to go for four years without setting eyes on your child. It is not easy, it is not easy, to an extent that someone becomes emotional. It is not easy. I am appealing wherever he is.." Netizens have since come out urging the social media influencer to reach out to his mother.
