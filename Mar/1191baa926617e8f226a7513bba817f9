Radio Jambo presenter Gidi Gidi is now fully recovered from food poisoning. Announcing the good news on social media, Gidi said he has also lost some weight. "Good morning, yes I have lost several kilos, I was sick, but now I have recovered." He went on to say that he had suffered food poisoning. "I thank God for the gift of life. Take care and watch what you eat. Food poisoning is real. Enjoy your day." Three weeks ago, he said he had been hospitalised. His radio co-host Ghost Mulee told listeners Gidi had taken a break. "Today, we are not with my boss. Tomorrow, we will not be with him either. My boss has taken a little break. I hope we will be with him on Monday," Ghost said during the morning session. The presenter had been updating his fans about his well-being "On the third day of the IV injection, I feel better," he said in one post. Early this year, the presenter and his family had been thrown into mourning after the demise of his seven-year-old niece Pendo, who died after a short illness. “Life can be so dramatic! My sister lost her only daughter at Metropolitan Hospital." "We had a long night but let me thank the hospital, my neighbour Wakili and friends who supported us through the process of transferring her body to the mortuary,” Gidi Gidi said on Instagram. Fans and celebrities, including his co-host Mulee and colleague Massawe Japani, condoled with him. "God is in control," Mulee wrote. "It is well. Poleni sana," Massawe added.
