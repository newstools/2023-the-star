Some 4,695 students from poor families in Kasipul constituency have benefited from Sh30.843 million bursary. The money was distributed courtesy of the National Government Constituency Development Fund to students in secondary schools and tertiary colleges. Kasipul MP Ong'ondo Were, who distributed cheques to various institutions, said the students were selected from various polling stations in their villages to ensure those deserving benefit. “Kasipul constituency officers conducted thorough vetting before they arrived on the deserving students. We used polling centres as the lowest unit to pick the students,” he said. The MP was speaking at the NGCDF offices in Oyugis town on Monday. He urged school principals to utilise the funds well to produce good academic results. Were also urged school heads to reduce cases of sending students back home for school fees to enable them to concentrate on their studies. “We provide bursary funds to reduce cases of sending students back home for school fees. This averts wastage of time but improve concentration,” he said. Were was in the company of area director of education Julius Opondo and former nominated MCA Mary Gaya. Opondo said the programme will boost academic standards in the constituency as it will reduce absenteeism. He urged parents to support programmes aimed at improving education in the constituency. “The government supports projects being done to improve academic standards. We urge parents to collaborate with teachers and education officials to ensure students stay in school,” Opondo said. Gaya said high poverty levels have caused many bright children to fail to acquire an education. "We’re hopeful the programme will enable them to achieve their academic dreams,” she said.
