Nacho Elvira of Spain has taken the lead in the 2023 Magical Kenya Open on -10 after the first two rounds at the Par 71 Muthaiga Golf Club course. German Nick Bachem, South African Jayden Schaper and Japanese Ryo Hisatsune are jointly on -9. The trio fired 9 under par 133 gross to catapult to joint second at halfway stage. It was a bitter pill to swallow for two former champions Ashun Wu and Lorenzo Gagli who failed to make the -1 cut much to their disappointment The surprise package of the day was Japanese pro-Hisatsune who fired a day’s score of -8 to join the trio. Robert MacIntyre (SCO), 71-65 (-6) who was the pre-event favourite could only manage T16. “I didn’t play any differently from yesterday. I’ve changed the ball this week, going for a bit more spin to try and get better distance control, to be honest, as hitting wedges into greens I’ve been all over the shop.: MacIntyre explained.
