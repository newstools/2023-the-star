Baby Brighton Junior Sagini Friday put her grandmother Rael Nyakerario, 84 at the scene of her torture and subsequent gouging out of his eyes. In a pre-recorded video, the baby, through a child expert told the court the grandmother orchestrated the removal of his eyes before dumping him in the nearby maize farm. Nyakerario is among other suspects, Alex Ochogo and Pacificah Nyakerario who are facing assault charges at the Kisii law courts. They are appearing before Senior Resident Magistrate Christine Ogweno. During the cross-examination, Sagini saidÂ  the defendant removed his eyes with her bare hands before being taken into the maize farm where he was found and dumped there. On the material day, Sagini said he had been sent to fetch water only to be waylaid by the assailant who gouged out his eyes. He was rushed to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital after primary medical attention at Marani Sub-County Hospital. Daniel Nyameino, a Clinician at the facility said he found Sagini's eyes leaking an ointment when he was brought in. The baby had scratch marks on her right eye showing signs of struggle as the assailant gouged out the eyes. He bandaged the gaping sockets. Nyameino further told the court the injuries were a result of a sharp object. The case will proceed on March 17 and the final hearing on March 24.
