The Azimio brigade has declared the start of their mass action against the Kenya Kwanza regime with the rallying call 'Ruto must go!'. In a statement on Thursday, Azimio principal Martha Karua said the August 9 General Election handed Kenyans an "illegitimate regime that is heartless, reckless and dictatorial." "Kenya Kwanza regime is dangerous for our democracy and therefore to restore the dignity of the Kenyan people and to put back our country on the path to prosperity, this illegitimate regime must go," Karua said. She spoke during Azimio's press conference at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Foundation. Karua spoke moments before Azimio leader Raila Odinga gave the way forward on the awaited mass action. He said the Opposition will not sit and watch as President William Ruto rewards his cronies through the creation of unnecessary and unconstitutional offices at the expense of already burdened taxpayers. "For this reason, Ruto must go," he said. Azimio's 14-day ultimatum for the government to act and lower the cost of living ended on Wednesday at midnight.
