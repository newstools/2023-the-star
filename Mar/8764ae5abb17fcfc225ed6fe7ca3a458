Over 200 swimmers will converge at the M-Pesa Academy in Thika on April 1 for the Mount Kenya  Swimming Championship The event will act as a yardstick to select a team for the Kampala Invitational Championship and Dubai's Hamilton Aquatics Development Championship set for April and June respectively. Mount Kenya secretary-cum -coach Ali  Omari said they have invited swimmers from Nairobi  and  Mombasa to come and spice up the event and offer competition to swimmers from the region. "We want to pick a strong team that will do duty for Kenya in both Uganda and Dubai and that's why preparations have kicked off in earnest in readiness for the double high-profile events. He added: "All those seeking to participate in the Thika contest should prepare sufficiently because of the high level of competition expected to be witnessed. "We also urge corporates and well-wishers to support these initiatives because when we work together, swimming as a sport will grow further and this will be for the betterment of the whole region," said Omari. Kenya intends to send 50 swimmers to the championship in Kampala scheduled for August 15-19.
