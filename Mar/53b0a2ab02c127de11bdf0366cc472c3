Thika Queens striker Wendy Atieno has been ruled out  for a month with a head injury, coach Fred Majani has confirmed. The 27-year old suffered concussion in their 1-0 loss to Zetech Sparks in the Women's Premier League match last Sunday. She was immediately rushed to hospital for assessment. The news is a blow to the 2021 champions since Atieno was in the form of her life and central to Thika's title ambitions. Atieno is the WPL top scorer with 13 goals, five more than her closest challenger Monica Etot of Kisumu Allstarlets. Etot has managed eight goals despite the lakeside club remaining in mid-table. "Atieno's injury is untimely. She was released from hospital on Monday  but it doesn't look good. She dislocated her nose and sustained mouth injuries. The doctor said if the swelling on the nose will not have improved after seven days, she will require surgery," Majani exclusively revealed to the star. "Definitely she will be out for a month. Atieno brings confidence to the rest of the team and obviously her services will be missed. The situation will likely force our hands into the transfer window to find a replacement." In more positive news, dependable defender Juliet Andibo faces race against time to be fit for the Trans Nzoia Falcons' match this weekend. The center back suffered a cut on the head after collision with the opposition striker but her situation looks better. "Andipo has 50-50 chance. She was stitched a few times on the head but probably she will play depending on the situation." Thika is third on the log with 21 points. Gaspo Women and Vihiga Queens occupy the first two slots. Majani said it will be suicidal to lose twice against Falcons having fired blanks against them in the first leg. "Dropping points against Trans Nzoia will not be acceptable. They beat us 1-0 in the first match so we have a point to prove."
