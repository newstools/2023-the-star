Losing to KCB and relinquishing the Kenya Volleyball Federation league title to Kenya Pipeline is still giving us sleepless nights, Kenya Prisons women's coach Josp Barasa has said. The wardresses lost to the bankers in the regular season as well as in the playoffs. Prisons also surrendered the title they had won for three consecutive seasons to the oil merchants. Prisons will take on KCB and Post Bank in the second leg scheduled forÂ  March 18-19 at Nyayo stadium. The team is eager to make amends for their mediocre run that saw them finish third in the playoffs. "It was painful to lose twice against the same opposition. We have had sleepless nights but we have a lot to play for this season. KCB are African Club champions, we respect them but we don't fear them," Barasa said. Prisons gave the Mombasa leg a wide berth. They also missed several players through family matters. Barasa said their match against Post Bank will be key before dealing with KCB. "We have pushed the players hard in training. Post bank is a new team that needs to be handled with caution." "We urge the players to remain focused. We need to organise our service, blocks and backcourt defense."
