Fafi Ward's ODM candidate in August 9, 2022, general election Feisal Gedi has finally received his election certificate from the IEBC. According to ODM, Gedi received his certificate on March 1. The award followed a court decision that nullified UPIA candidate Kolosho Ahmed, announcing Gedi as the validly elected MCA for Fafi. This was after the court found irregularities following a recount in two polling stations. "Feisal Gedi, our candidate for the FAFI Ward seat in the 9/8/22 general election receives his election certificate from an @IEBCKenya official after the court in Garissa quashed the election of Kolosho Ahmed of UPIA party and declared him (Gedi) the winner. Congratulations," the Orange party said. Kolosho had only served for six months as Fafi MCA. A recount ordered by the court indicated that Gedi had 130 votes in Hagadera polling station and not 30 as was booked in form 36B. While announcing judgement on the petition by Gedi, Garissa Chief Magistrate Hezron Nyeberi said was satisfied that the results contained in Form 36A for Hagadera polling station 2 of 2 were not properly recorded into form 36B. He said 100 votes irregularly added to Kolosho at the polling station if reduced from the collated tally will reduce his total tally to 702 votes, which means Gedi won the election by at least 151 votes.
