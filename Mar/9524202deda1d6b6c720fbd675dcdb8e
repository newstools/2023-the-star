Kenyatta University's feat at the Kenya University Sports Association women’s league in Rongo over the weekend will spur the team to better things. Coach Robert Osano said KU will use the victory as a morale booster to push for better results in the Kenya Handball Federation league. “The win in the KUSA games was big for us and it will act as a motivator for the team going into our last league games,” offered Osano. KU beat Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology 22-19 in a tight final after shutting out Chuka 30-10 in the semi-finals. “MMUST game would have gone either way. They were leading at half-time and we had to change tact after the break to overturn the result.” Osano said KU, who are seventh in the league table with three wins are going to their weekend match against second-placed Ulinzi Sharks with their heads up. “We are not looking back. I am sure from the confidence my girls now have, we will get a point from this game,” observed Osano. On the chances of his men’s side booking a ticket to the six-team Super Cup, Osano exuded confidence that the target is achievable. “We are sure we make it to the top six bracket. I’ve looked at our remaining matches and it gives me so much hope that we will achieve our goal.” He said that KU, who are sixth with 22 points from 11 wins, have a huge advantage considering they have played all their fixtures against top teams. “We have a pending walkover against Makueni Bees and if this will be effected, the two points will push us some steps up the ladder,” he said. Reigning champions National Cereals and Produce Board are leading the top five with Ulinzi, GSU, Black Mamba and Strathmore following in that order. On Saturday, the varsity side have a date against mid-table Desert Scorpions who are placed eleventh after winning five matches. Osano said handball at KU has improved considerably in the two years he has been at the helm and there is still room to do more.
