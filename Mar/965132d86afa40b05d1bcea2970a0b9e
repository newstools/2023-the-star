General Service Unit captain Raphael Chege believes their win over unbeaten Ulinzi is a morale booster for their Kenya Handball Federation title hunt. He said the victory against the previously unbeaten Ulinzi has given them the groove and the impetus to gun for a respectable finish in the league. The paramilitary side chalked up their biggest win of the season when they disarmed Ulinzi 26-22 in a hard-fought clash at Nyayo National Stadium over the weekend. The win pushed GSU to third place with 30 points, the same as the soldiers who tasted defeat for the first time in their 15 games played so far. “We have not played for weeks, but the result of this game showed that what we have been working hard to achieve is now becoming a reality,” said Chege. “We will continue to work hard both for the league as well as the upcoming regional police games in Rwanda later this month.” The crucial win that dimmed Ulinzi’s title hopes comes after they had posted mixed results last week, losing 32-20 to champions National Cereals and Produce Board and beating Thika 30-26. “These results shows we are very much still in the run. We will keep working hard to also make the cut for the Super Cup,” said Chege. GSU led 11-9 in the win over Ulinzi and had Christopher Mayenda nailing nine goals while Fenwick Opicho and Oscar Philip posted four each. Leading the Ulinzi onslaught was Noah Cheruiyot, who scored five goals while Kevin Imo and Wycliffe Juma managed four a piece
