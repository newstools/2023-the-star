Everton has emerged as one of Arsenal's bogey teams in the last couple of years as the two sides prepare for a thrilling encounter in the 25th round of the English Premier League on Wednesday. Leaders Arsenal, who have managed 57 points thus far, lost 1-0 in the revere fixture courtesy of James Tarkowski's  60th minute goal at the Goodison Park on February 4. The lanky defender headed past Aron Ramsdale from an in-swinging Dwight McNeill's corner. Everton are 18th with a meager 21 points. Revenge could be on the menu. Mikel Arteta's side maintained their grip on top spot by beating Leicester City 1-0. Brazilian Gabriel Matinell scored the lone goal. The Toffees on the other hand, dropped backed into the relegation battle after their 2-0 defeat in the hands of Unai Emery's Aston Villa. Arsenal’s defeat against Everton was their first in 14 games. The Gunners lost for a third successive game at Goodison under Arteta. Arsenal has won back-to-back matches after a mini wobble that saw them take just one point from matches against Everton, Brentford and Manchester City. Everton's away form has been terrible, winning just two of their last 28 away EPL matches. This is the worst record in the division. It remains to be seen whether Thomas Partey will play. The Ghanaian midfielder has been on and off the starting lineup since January with a recurring knee injury. However, Arsenal can relay on Joginho in the absence of Partey after the Italy international arrived at the Emirates from rivals Chelsea in the January transfer window. Gabriel Jesus and Mohamed Elneny are long term absentees. Andros Townsend, Nathan Patterson, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and James Garner miss out for Everton.
