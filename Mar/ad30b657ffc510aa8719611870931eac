Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has urged women to fight for their top positions in government. Speaking during the re-launch of the Women Enterprise Fund and Second Product of the Hustler Fund at KICC, Gachagua said he acknowledges the efforts several women have made to be in top leadership. "If you see a male employee not doing their work properly, remove them and appoint women," he said. He also lauded women who won the August 9 general elections, saying they placed their best foot forward and became good women leaders. "Susan Kihika won against a big name in Nakuru. During the elections, men were feared, but the women took lead," he said. Gachagua also urged the women not to stay at home as they will be forgotten, adding that raising their voices will increase women's leadership. "Msikae nyumbani mgonje mletewe viti, (don't stay at home and wait for positions)," he said. Speaking during the same event, President William Ruto also said his government recognises women as more of them voted for his administration as compared to men. Ruto said it is because women believe in him and his regime that they can be in government today. "That is why we are here to celebrate you today because you believed in us," he said. He said that women need to be celebrated because they are even braver than men. "When we were being threatened and blackmailed and people associated with me were being targeted, the women did not run away," he said. He said because of women's unwavering support, he committed to including them highly in his government.
