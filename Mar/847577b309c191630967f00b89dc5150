An Eldoret-based entertainer Janet Jerop commonly referred to as DJ hotjantex has landed an ambassadorial job with Gamepawa, a betting company. The DJ has been tasked with marketing the company’s products and services. This comes hours after Jerop was discharged from the hospital where she had been bedridden for the last month after developing a vessel problem on her right leg. "As a company, we have a social responsibility policy. When the story about Janet came to light, we took the responsibility to ensure that she gets home well from the hospital," a statement signed by the company's business executive Peter Kyeti said. "We will also ensure she has a smooth recovery. We are currently offering her an online ambassadorship." The company has further pledged to support her during the recovery process. Her condition came to light after a viral post on social media where she was captured appealing for Sh1.2 million for medical aid. In the post, Jerop singled out former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko in settling the bill requesting him to help offset the bill. "Mweshimiwa Mike Sonko, I have seen God using you to help those in need. I’m in the hospital with a huge bill, kindly help. I’m looking forward to your reply. Thanks in advance,” she wrote. Nandi leaders led by Governor Stephen Sang, however, came to her aid and cleared the bill. "Thank you Nandi county leadership for stepping in to clear the medical bill of our daughter Djhotjantex," Sang said. The first surgery was conducted with medics saying she will have to undergo four others within the next six months. "I would like to thank everyone who has come through to lend a helping hand. My governor for paying my bill, the county women's representative for paying for my flight, and Gamepawa Kenya who facilitated my travel to the airport and gave me a job," she said.
