Karateka Joyce Juma is among the 25 women who have landed scholarships for the 2023 Commonwealth Women’s Leadership Programme 2023. The 25 women were picked within the Commonwealth nations and territories and will get the opportunity to build skills toward personal development in sports management. This is the second phase of the program with cycling administrator Angela Achieng having attended the first initiative in 2022. NOC-K secretary general, Francis Mutuku, said the process was competitive and congratulated Juma for her award. " We are happy the best candidate turned out to be an active athlete, whose application was approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation to undertake the program," he said. Mutuku said Juma's scholarship is worth five thousand pounds and the program will run for 12 months. " The beneficiaries of the scholarship have their own development plans to fit their current status and ambitions, as well as adapted programs for their communities." Mutuku stated that they have kick-started a number of programs for 'Women in Sport' as they push the agenda of gender balance. ‘‘Within the 'Women in Sports' programme, we are supporting technical and administration officials in terms of training and exposure. We have held forums with leaders, coaches, journalists, referees and administrators and we are implementing the recommendations from these forums on how to bridge the gap,’’ Mutuku said. Commenting on the program, Juma said: ‘‘I am very excited and happy about this new path I am about to undertake to develop my skills as a leader. My aim is to grow not only myself but also the community,"
