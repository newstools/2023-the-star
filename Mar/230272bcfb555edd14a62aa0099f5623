Chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya Athletes Commission Humphrey Kayange has outlined the roles of the commission. Last week, NOC-K unveiled an eight-member team led by former Kenya sevens captain Kayange. Surprisingly, most people do not know precisely the duties of the commission. "The commission is a voice of the athletes within the Olympic movement," Khayange 40,Â  maintained. Kayange is also a member of the International Olympic Committee. Two-time 5,000m World Champion Hellen Obiri and national women's hockey team captain Gilly Okumu are also part of the team. George Darril, Joseph Okal, Mercy Moim, Wilister Nyoro and Andrew Amonde were also appointed. Kayange added: "Dealing with the welfare of athletes is top-notch. This ensures athletes are involved in decision-making even within federations". Kayange is the brother to Collins Injera who also retired from playing in January aged 36. Injera was also inducted into the Fiji Hall of Fame. "Federations need to empower athletes as early as possible because they are they leaders of tomorrow. The sooner athletes are introduced into management and governance, the better," Kayange said..
