The final 18-man squad for the Africa Junior Championships will be named this weekend, under-21 men's coach Mike Malungu has revealed. The junior championship will be held on March 12-19 in Ismailia, Egypt. Malungu who doubles up as the Western Jaguars coach added that the team has been training for the last two months. "We have no time for sure. The travelling contingent will be known by Sunday. The boys have been hard at work," Malungu hinted. The men's team will be up against South Africa, Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria and Zimbabwe with matches played in a round-robin format. Their women counterparts take on  South Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Egypt. Malungu said they will follow the routine selection process. Certain factors must be considered for a quality team to be selected. "The individual technical ability is a priority. The players must fit into the system. We also look at forming partnerships  while discipline and fitness levels will be dealt with." The selected players must be born after January 2002. Malungu promised a free and fair selection process saying, "Complaints arose that we only took players from Wazalendo and Jaguars for the five-a-side World Cup qualifiers but they delivered." "We will not look at club or region. We are going to give everyone a chance. Our only problem is, is the player up to the task?"
