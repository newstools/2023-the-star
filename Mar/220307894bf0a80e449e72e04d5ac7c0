Primary school teachers and headteachers have faulted the secondary school teachers union for creating confusion in the education sector. Kenya National Union of Teachers and Kenya Primary School Headteachers Association submitted a joint statement on Thursday. Knut Secretary General Collins Oyuu said KUPPET is only after ensuring their membership keeps growing. “It is ridiculous and hypocritical that people are calling for the disbandment of for reasons not benefiting the proposal for the same,” Oyuu said. Oyuu explained that for Knut, it’s not about membership but the future of children. The row over membership of teachers came up when KUPPET proposed that Grade 7 learners be domiciled in secondary schools. “The issue of membership is not our concern. Membership of a union is very candid where a teacher is allowed to choose a union,” he said. On the taskforce disbandment, Oyuu said the Presidential Working Party on Education reforms is qualified to give the correct direction. “The taskforce is made up of who is who in the education sector and we can not underrate its ability when we should only make proposals for better things,” he said. KUPPET SG Akelo Misori said the taskforce led to more confusion in their second interim report. “Kuppet calls for the disbandment of the CBC task force, notwithstanding their eminence in society, the party has contributed more confusion than solutions,” Misori said. In a press conference on Tuesday, the union expressed their dissatisfaction with the conduct of the JSS transition. Misori warned that if action is not taken, the 1.2 million pioneer cohort's future is at stake. “There are unclear teacher management procedures that have resulted in many cases being lodged by JSS teachers,” he said. The SG said it’s not too late to take back the learners to secondary school. Misori explained that secondary schools are more equipped to host learners.
