Fifteen disciplines will be involved in the first-ever National Olympic Committee of Kenya Beach Games set for Malindi, Kilifi County. The two-day championship will take place on March 18-19 at Buntwani Park. NOC-K secretary general Francis Mutuku said the event will be used to select a team for the Africa Beach Games and the World Beach Games slated for later in the year. Africa Beach Games will be held in Tunisia while the global assignment will be staged in Bali, Indonesia. "We have a total of 15 disciplines for the Malindi show. Among them; Tennis, handball, volleyball, soccer, 3x3 basketball, fishing competitions and wrestling," Mutuka said. "We are already planning for the continental and planatory duties. These activities are therefore vital." Mutuka presumed that promoting sports tourism is part of the agenda as this will allow communities to be part and parcel of the events. "Taking the event to the Coast is one way to promote sports tourism. We also would like to fully engage the community around us. By so doing, we will be advancing the Internal Olympic Committee IOC agenda." "The main objective is to have teams represent us and engage and encourage federations to have athletes take part in the assignment.Â Beach games entail the principle of low cost because we use the natural resources available which is good for the environment."
