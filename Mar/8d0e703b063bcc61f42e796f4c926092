Kitale golfer Josephine Njeri recorded her maiden title when she won the second leg of the Kenya Seed Company tournament at the nine-hole Eldoret Golf Club over the weekend. Njeri won the coveted prize after carding a solid 47 stableford points in a tournament that attracted 130 players from Eldoret, Kitale, Nandi, Kericho and Railway clubs on the par 71 golf course. Teeing off at handicap 52, Njeri edged out home player Susan Bett to second. In the opening nine, she started off badly with back-to-back double bogeys, followed by bogeys and double bogeys on her way to victory. Njeri said it is humbling to put in such a performance, sweetened by clinching the title away from home. “ I am so overwhelmed, I did not expect to win. There was a huge number of better golfers and professionals at the tournament but regular practice and guidance from members of Kitale Club has paid off,” she said. The company’s managing Director Fred Oloibe said: "We came to say thank you to our farmers and we appreciate the support the Eldoret/ Uasin Gishu region has given us over the years." "We will continue supporting the tournament annually and for this season we assure all our farmers there is enough seed for purchase since these rains have started." The series heads to Kitale on March 25/26 for the Kenya Seed Golf Classic, whereby golfers across the region are expected to battle for a heifer.
