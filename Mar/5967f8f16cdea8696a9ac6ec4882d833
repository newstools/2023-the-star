Prince Harry believes in reincarnation and hopes to come back as an elephant one day. Reincarnation is the religious or philosophical belief that the soul or spirit, after biological death, begins a new life in a new body. It may be human, animal or spiritual depending on the moral quality of the previous life's actions.
