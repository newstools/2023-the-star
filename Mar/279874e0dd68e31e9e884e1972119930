Mumias East MP Peter Salasya has asked Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi to slot him in a parliamentary committee in the national assembly. Salasya who was speaking in Madungu, Ugunja constituency on Friday evening, said that he was following Wandayi to get his favour. "Mheshimiwa si umeona mimi nimetembea hadi nimekuja kwako? Nitafutieko committee huko kwa National Assembly, umesikia? (Honourable I have reached your territory. Kindly slot me in one of the parliamentary committees of the National Assembly, alright?" Salasya said. The request by the comedian-cum-politician saw Wandayi burst into laughter to the amusement of the crowd. Salasya had attended the unveiling of new assistant chief's office and a Police post built by the NG-CDF of Ugunja constituency. The first time MP said called for the need for reforms in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and urgent remedies to rescue the hurting Junior Secondary Schools across the country. While at it, Salasya eyes were fixed on the price - being slotted as a member of a committee. "You did a good job of electing honourable (Wandayi) who is our boss and who slots us in committees there in the National Assembly," he said. The first-time legislator said that he would emulate Wandayi and construct decent offices for chiefs and their assistants in Mumias East. "God has been elevating him. I see him becoming your governor. The holy spirit is telling me so," Salaysa added.
