Ugandan Pro-Golfer Ronald Rugumayo is the lone player to have hit a hole-in-one in the ongoing 2023 Magical Kenya Open at Muthaiga Golf Club. For his troubles, the 31-year-old who hit an eagle in the second hole on Day 1 of the tournament, was rewarded with a return ticket by Kenya Airways for the extraordinary feat. Habil Waswani (KQ Director Legal Services & Company Secretary) was at hand to present to the player a return ticket. The ticket is open for him to travel anywhere on the globe for a period ending this year. An elated Rugumayo praised KQ for being considerate despite the European Tour having no prizes for the hole-in-one (Hole 2) exploits. "Truly leaving this tournament minus anything would have been sad despite my efforts. I want to thank KQ first for being considerate and here for me and I will utilize my ticket for a future tournament," Rugumayo said. He added: "I know I did not perform at my optimum since I did not make the cut but we have a next time. I thank all my supporters at home and sponsors for standing with me and surely next year, we will be back." On his part, Waswani praised the player for his feat urging him to continue on his path. The Ugandan national player whose home club is in Kampala City has so far in his golfing career had a total of 14 hole-in-one successes.
