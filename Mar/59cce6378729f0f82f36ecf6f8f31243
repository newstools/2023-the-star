A section of Nyanza Farmers has recommended the closure of all sugar mills operating within the Nyando Sugar belt to allow for the maturity of cane. The farmers claimed that the reports on the government’s intention of closing up only the state-owned mills due to scarcity of raw materials will not be wise if the private millers are left to operate. Speaking to the Star, the farmers led by Kenya Sugar cane Growers Association Secretary General Richard Ogendo noted that if it's a matter of closing the mills then all of them should be closed within the Nyando sugar belt. Ogendo said this should include both private and government-owned mills. He noted there has been a scarcity of cane for some time hence they were incurring huge losses since their canes were being harvested when they have not matured enough. Ogendo said some are being harvested for as low as eight months. “We recommend all the mills (private and state-owned) within Nyando sugar belt to be closed for at least four months to allow the maturity of canes.” He further called on CS agriculture to look into their request and consider this for the sake of the farmers. “We want this decision to apply to all the millers both the private and public mills," noted Ogendo. Kenyan millers usually use the weight-based method to pay farmers for the immature cane that is normally under weight. Ogendo noted that the government still owes farmers Sh1.2 billion which should be cleared.
