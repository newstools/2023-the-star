An autopsy on the body of a Chemase Secondary School Form 1 student, who died while undergoing treatment has failed to provide the cause of death. A government pathologist, Dr Simon Omuok said further analysis is needed to establish the true cause of death. The deceased, Kelvin Kiptanui, 16, died at Nandi-Hills hospital while undergoing treatment after alleged corporal punishment at school. The pathologist noted that most of the organs needed to be investigated in detail to end suspicions and that samples had been removed for analysis. Accompanied by the acting medical superintendent at Nandi-Hills Level 4 mortuary, Dr Elkana Chirchir, Dr Omuok said he had handed over his findings to the DCI for action. He said he had given his postmortem report to the county criminal investigation officer Douglas Chikanda. The postmortem took four hours as family members among them Kiptanui's mother Monica Jerobon, relatives, school representatives and police waited patiently. The government pathologist refused to make public his findings saying they had agreed with the family representatives to leave the matter with the DCI. “I have handed over the report to CCIO for perusal and action and the matter can only be commented by DCI and neither the hospital nor I can,” Dr Omuok said. Chikanda said they had allowed the family to carry out the preparation of the burial as they proceed with investigations and action. Kelvin was taken ill after two teacher handed him 22 strokes of the cane each together with his classmate after they were nabbed cheating in a physics quiz. The two teachers now face the wrath of the Teachers’ Service Commission. The family spokesperson, Charles Kirong said they were cautioned from amplifying the case as it could prejudice the investigation.
