The hearing of a Sh14.5 billion tax evasion case against Keroche Breweries Ltd director Tabitha Muigai Karanja did not proceed on Tuesday after she changed her lawyers. When the matter came up, Milimani senior principal magistrate Esther Kimilu directed it to be mentioned on March 13. This is to enable Karanja, who is also Nakuru senator, to confirm whether her new defense lawyer has obtained copies of witness documents from her previous lawyers. The matter could not proceed because Karanja's new lawyer had not yet received the documents from the previous lawyers. However, the office of Director of Public Prosecutions is ready to proceed since they have supplied all the documents to the defense. The senator has denied 10 counts levelled against her by the state. The DPP has already withdrawn charges against the senator's husband, Joseph Karanja, due to his health condition. According to the charge sheet, the accused on diverse dates between February 20, 2015, and January 20, 2016, unlawfully made incorrect statements on their excise duty returns by reducing it by Sh1.8 billion. They also made incorrect statements for January 2017 to December 2017 which affected their payable excise duty by Sh3.6 billion. According to the prosecution, between February 20 and July 20, 2019, they unlawfully omitted from their VAT returns for January to June, affecting their VAT liability by Sh196 million. The senator and her husband were arrested after the DPP ordered their arrest and arraignment to answer charges of tax fraud committed between January 2015 and June 2019.
