Australian officials are hopeful Fifa will abandon plans to have Saudi Arabia’s tourism authority sponsor the 2023 Women’s World Cup. Co-hosts Australia and New Zealand recently asked Fifa to “urgently clarify” reports Visit Saudi was to be an official sponsor for the tournament. They have yet to hear back from world football’s governing body but maintain they are “not comfortable with it”. The Gulf kingdom has been accused of human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in sporting events in recent years but has been accused of using events to ‘sportswash’ its reputation. Sources indicated that Football Australia has continued to make opposition to any such deal clear and there are hopes, as a result, that a U-turn is possible. “Football Australia has consulted on this matter with key stakeholders, including government and commercial partners, and it was an overwhelming consensus that this partnership does not align with our collective vision for the tournament and falls short of our expectations,” said Football Australia chief executive James Johnson. "Whilst the partnership has not been confirmed by Fifa, based on the consultations we have had with our community, key stakeholders and our own position, we would not be comfortable with it.” While we await further clarity and information as to the details of the partnership from Fifa, we continue to convey this clear message on behalf of Football Australia, New Zealand Football, and our community. "The Women’s World Cup takes place from July 20 to August 20 in cities across Australia and New Zealand, and organisers believe a record two billion people could watch the tournament. United States forward Alex Morgan said “morally, it just doesn’t make sense” when speaking about Saudi Arabia’s tourism authority reportedly sponsoring the tournament.
