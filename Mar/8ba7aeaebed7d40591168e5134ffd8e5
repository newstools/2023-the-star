Patience in front of the goal is all that Monicah Etot needs to become unplayable, Kisumu All Starlets coach Juma Said has said Etot is second in the goal-scoring charts in the Women's Premier League with eight goals. Injured Thika Queens forward Wendy Atieno, leads the way with 13 strikes. All Starlets have managed 16 goals meaning Etot has scored half of the goals. She has, however, squandered some clear-cut chances that have proved costly to the team. "Etot needs to be calm, especially when facing the goalkeeper. She needs to be much stronger and tack in the easy chances," Said said. "She has the potential to become the top scorerÂ  but must take advantage of the service she enjoys from the teammates." Said presumed that the injured duo of Cynthia Akinyi and Katherine Nabiswa are progressing well with their rehabilitation. "Nabiswa is doing light training but we won't rush her back. Akinyi is still far away. She needs another two months but the early signs are positive." Kisumu All Startlet is 10th on the log with 13 points. Kangemi Ladies and Kayole Starlets are 11th and 12th respectively and face a relegation dogfight. Last season, Kisumu found their footing by winning the last three matches to steer clear of relegation. "We are not where we are supposed to be if the quality at my disposal is anything to go by. We need to have a good build-up in matches, improve on communication and maintain our structure during games."
