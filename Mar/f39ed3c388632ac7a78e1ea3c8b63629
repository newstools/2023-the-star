First Lady Rachael Ruto on Tuesday flagged off the Mama Cycling Awareness Ride 2023. They cycled from State House and ended at Karura Forest in Nairobi. Under the theme " Share the Road", the awareness ride aimed to promote road safety, courtesy, and non-motorized transport inventions for environmental sustainability.  The cyclists later joined the first lady in planting 200 trees at Karura Forest. Mama Rachael said cycling as a form of non-motorized transport is a sustainable mode of transportation that cuts the number of motorists on the roads. She added that it also contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions. The first lady said that a combination of tree planting and cycling is a positive move toward creating sustainable cities.
