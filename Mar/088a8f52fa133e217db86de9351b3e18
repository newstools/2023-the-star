Kabras Rugby coach Carlos Katywa believes the team that will make less errors in the final of the Kenya Cup next weekend will be crowned champions. Kabras play KCB in the final of the Kenya Cup on March 11. They beat Harlequins 22-8 in the semis on Saturday at their backyard (Kakamega showground). The sugar millers beat the bankers in the regular season but Katywa reckons that the final will be a different ball game altogether. "To be honest, it is the biggest pressure of my coaching experience because KCB is coming to Kakamega. We will begin as underdogs considering their quality." "The team that makes the least mistakes stands a chance. It will be about technicality, defense and execution," Katywa reckons. He added that they will study their opponents and craft the perfect game plan that will ensure the trophy remains on home soil. "We need to sit down and look at their game against Oilers. There's also need to look at ourselves and see what can be improve. This final will be different from any other final," Katywa said.
