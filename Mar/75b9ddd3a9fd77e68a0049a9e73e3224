Opposition leader Raila Odinga is starting mass action up to March 20 to overthrow the "illegitimate" government of President William Ruto. Mass action is not yet justified. The Supreme  Court ratified the win of President William Ruto. That's why key opposition leaders have been conspicuous by their absence in the various demos that Raila has held so far. Interior CS Kithure Kindiki has threatened Raila with "full force" if his supporters break the law during their mass action. Every Kenyan has the constitutional right to protest and criticise government. The police should not stop these demonstrations (which most likely will be quite small). However the police should protect the public and ensure that these 'mass demos' do not interfere with the daily life of Kenyans. The police should ensure that these 'mass demos' do not block any roads, occupy any offices, or loot any shops. Ideally Raila and his Movement for the Defence of Democracy should meet in secure venues like Uhuru Gardens to avoid disruption. Whatever happens, Kindiki and the police should remember that Raila is entitled to demonstrate, even if he is not entitled to break the law.
