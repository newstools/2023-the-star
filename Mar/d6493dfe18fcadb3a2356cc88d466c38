KCB Rugby club is charging up for a grueling semi-final playoff match against Menengai Oilers today at the Lion's  Den Ruaraka. This is a repeat  of last season's final four clash at the same venue as the Kenya Cup season edges closer. Gibson Weru’s men overpowered KCB 24-19 through eight penalties converted by Geoffrey Ominde but this could be a different ball game altogether. The two teams met in the regular season away in Nakuru. KCB exerted  revenge after humiliating the Nakuru side 62-15 in front of their home crowd. KCB Backs Coach Mariko Mushilla said: “We understand the magnitude of the clash and the pressure that comes with it.  We are prepared well both physically and technically. We do not want to take anything for granted. We are paying close attention to the details hopefully we emerge victorious on Saturday.” This season, the bankers have been on top form winning 10 out of 11 matches played in the regular season with the only loss being to Kabras Sugar on match-day 10. KCB is keen to reclaim its glory after last season’s disappointment in what could have been their 5th Kenya Cup title in a row. Oilers are gunning for their maiden Kenya Cup triumph. Meanwhile, the referees for the matches have been revealed. Constant Cap takes charge of the Kabras Sugar versus Kenya Harlequin fixture at the Kakamega show ground. Cap will be assisted by Victor Oduor and Nobert Bonyi Godwin Karuga will be in control of the KCB  do-or-die encounter in Nairobi. Duncan Kioko and Anthony Ndong will be his assistants.
