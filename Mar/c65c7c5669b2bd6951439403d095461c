Might Eagles FC under-17 team will play in this year's Gothia Cup invitational tournament in Gothenburg, Sweden in mid July. Eagles FC coach Moses Zewedi said the tournament will be held between July 16-22. “We are appealing to well-wishers  to support us in order to honor the upcoming tournament. It's not easy to get a chance to play in such a competition but we intend to travel with 28 players and six officials," Zewedi said. Zewedi added that over 1700 teams from 70 countries are expected to grace the occasion. The Kitale-based academy is known for nurturing young talent and has been a success under Zewedi. Zewedi said the juniors are benefiting from their training through the CAF D trained coaches  that nurture their talents. As a result of playing soccer, they win full scholarships to study in different secondary schools within the county. “We are not just playing football but we try to keep the athletes busy especially during weekends and over the holidays. This prevents them from participating in vices like theft and drug abuse," Zewedi said. “Recently the under 15 and under 13 kids won the Trans Nzoia County Kenya Football Association league. Being our maiden invite, we have many expectations because during the tournament scouts from all over the world will be there. Some of our players might be scouted, who knows?" quipped Zewedi.
