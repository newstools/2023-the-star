Elite and upcoming athletes are expected to grace the inaugural University of Eldoret 10km Road race set for this Saturday at the UoE pavilion. UoE Director of Sports Kibet Rono said the race will be a celebration of ten years since they were handed a charter by former president, the late Mwai Kibaki. Rono said the institution has been associated with athletics and therefore a 10km road race will be a perfect fit in celebrating their milestone. “This is a new race at the university, to celebrate ten years since we were handed our service charter. It will also mark the last days of the university’s Vice Chancellor Professor Ruth Akenga,” said Rono. The university has been hosting a UoE cross country in November but which has been put on hold since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The event will consist a 10km road race for the elite men and women, a 5km race for UoE staff, students and guests and a 2km cross country for children between 8-12 years old. “The elite 10km race carries a Sh30,000 prize for the winner, with the cash awards trickling down to the 10th finisher,” said Rono. The 10km race will start at 8am at Teresia along the Eldoret-Ziwa Road and conclude at the UoE pavilion. “We intend to have a very good race now that we have very few road races in the country at the moment. We hope to attract top athletes as they come to enjoy running in the scenic environment,” said Rono.
