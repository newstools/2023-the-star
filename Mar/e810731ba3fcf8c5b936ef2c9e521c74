Former Machakos gubernatorial candidate Nzioka Waita has resigned as  Chama Cha Uzalendo party leader. Nzioka on February 28, 2023, issued his resignation letter to the party's acting CEO Sylvester Mutune. He copied the same to both Registrar of political parties Ann Nderitu and CCU deputy party leader Florence Mwangangi. Mwangangi was his running mate in the polls. "Kindly be advised that I have resigned from the position of the party leader and all attendant party committee memberships of CCU with immediate effect, " Nzioka stated in the letter. "I extend my sincere appreciation to the party NEC for the privilege of supporting my gubernatorial candidature in the general elections of 2022." The former State  House chief of staff took over as Chama Cha Uzalendo party leader on February 28, 2022. Nzioka's leadership was published in the Kenya Gazette Notice No 1992 under the Political Parties Act NO 11 of 2011 on the same day. Speaking publicly for the first time after he took over as the party’s leader, Nzioka then said his party would support Azimio La Umoja and a Raila Odinga presidency on August 9. The CCU leader addressed the faithful at Salvation Army Church at Nguluni in Matungulu, Machakos county. The former  Machakos gubernatorial aspirant said Raila was the perfect reformist capable of uniting all Kenyans. He said the Kenyan leadership should be vested in honest leaders and Raila fits the bill. “Raila is a leader par excellence, the others are in a lower cohort,” Nzioka said. CCU party leadership was declared vacant after former Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti joined the Wiper party in 2016 ahead of the 2017 general election. Ndeti contested for the Machakos gubernatorial seat on a Wiper ticket in 2017 but lost to Governor Alfred Mutua. Nzioka lost to Ndeti in 2022 Machakos gubernatorial race.
