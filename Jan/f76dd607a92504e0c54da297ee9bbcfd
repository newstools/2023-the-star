Eight people have been arrested in Kisumu during a crackdown on banned single-use plastic bags. The eight were arrested in Ahero market within Nyando subcounty where the National Environment Management Authority officers carried out a raid. Nema enforcement officer Moses Ombogo said the single-use plastic bags were slowly re-emerging on the shelves and continued to pose a threat to the environment more than five years after they were banned. Ombogo said the operation targeted to wipe out the plastic bags which are believed to be finding their way into the country illegally. "The ban is still in place and anybody contravening the regulations risks a fine of Sh2 million, two years in jail or both," he said. "This ban has been in force since 2017. Kenya is a plastic-free country and we are asking members of the public to desist from their use." Ombogo said Nema together with other departments has intensified patrols to ensure the products don’t get into the country. He also asked the traders to use eco-friendly bags which are available to package their goods and products. “We are advising traders to use Uhuru bags which are eco-friendly and available. In the arrest we made, most of the traders were using single-use plastic bags to package rice and sugar,” he said. The operation spearheaded by Environmental Management Inspectorate officials and officials from Kisumu, Homa Bay, Vihiga and Kakamega, also checked on water quality at various entities emitting effluents into water bodies in the area.
