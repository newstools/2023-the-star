The Sh3.5 billion Anglo Leasing corruption case which resumed hearings on Monday will continue today. On Monday, investigating officer who handled the Sh3.5 billion Anglo leasing case produced documents obtained from Switzerland to be used as evidence. The documents had initially been declined by the court but later allowed following an appeal by the state. John Kiilu told Anticorruption Magistrate Martha Mutuku that charges preferred against the Kamani family and other accused persons in the case were based on the investigations conducted. Kiilu was testifying against former PSs Joseph Magari, Dave Mwangi and David Onyonka and businessmen Deepak and Rashmi Kamani. The accused persons have denied conspiring to defraud the Government of over Sh3.5 billion. The charges relate to security tenders that the government has termed irregular. In September last year, the high court admitted the documents obtained from Swiss authorities to be relied on as evidence in the case. This is after the DPP had appealed the decision by Magistrate Felix Kombo to strike out the documents on the basis that they were not properly preserved before being transmitted to Kenya. The evidence was obtained through two requests for mutual legal assistance to Switzerland 13 years ago.
