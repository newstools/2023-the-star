Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa has poked holes in the government's decision to take full charge of former education CS George Magoha's burial. In a statement on Sunday, Barasa asked why the government is helping his family yet they are rich and well-established. "Why would the government help the family of Prof. George Magoha?, Just asking on behalf of Kenyans. This is a Rich family and the good Professor who rested has children and family members whom he assisted get employment left right and centre throughout his life when he was holding positions of influence," he said. Barasa said that Magoha's wife can access his wealth and she is not struggling like ordinary Kenyans. "He rested without a huge hospital bill and with a Premier medical cover unlike many hustlers who have rested in different funeral homes and their bodies are detained, title deeds, logbooks are being demanded before release," Barasa said. He added that instead of channeling finances to his funeral, the state should use it to clear medical bills and pay school fees for needy children in Siaya. Barasa added that by helping needy people it would be the best way to honour his legacy. On Saturday, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua said the government will provide the necessary support to the family to ensure he gets a befitting send-off. As part of the support, Gachagua announced that a Kenya Airforce helicopter will be availed to airlift the body from Nairobi to his Gem home in Siaya. He said that the government will cater for other logistical support including tents and food for the mourners. To help in coordination and burial preparations, Gachagua said that ICT CS Eliud Owalo, Interior PS Raymond Omollo and the Chief of Staff at the Deputy President’s Office George McGoye would represent the government. “We are ready to provide any other support the family might need from us,” Gachagua said. Magoha died on January 24 and will be buried next Saturday, February 11.
