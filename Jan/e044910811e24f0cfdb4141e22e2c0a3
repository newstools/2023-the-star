Kiambu county will for the next seven days experience sunny and dry conditions in most parts, despite rains received Tuesday. County director of meteorological services Magdalene Gateri said morning rains are likely to occur over several places during the first half of the forecast period, while afternoon showers are expected over a few places. Nights are likely to be partly cloudy, though occasional showers may occur in a few places. The forecast covers January 3-9. Gateri advised farmers to make use of the ongoing rains. “I urge residents to harvest water any time it rains,” she said Tuesday. Gateri said although sunny and dry conditions prevailed over most areas of the county in the last one week, most subcounties will experience cloudy rainy showers, especially in the morning. Limuru, Kabete, Githunguri, Kiambaa, Lari, Kikuyu and Kiambu township will in the next seven days experience cloudy rainy showers with temperatures of between 12 and 21 degrees, she said. Afternoon temperatures will go as high as 26 degrees. “Most nights throughout the forecast, however, will be partly cloudy with light showers,” Gateri said. According to Kennedy Thiong’o from the Meteorological Department, Kiambu, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang’a, Nyandarua, Laikipia, Meru, Embu, Tharaka Nithi and Nairobi counties will in the first half of the seven days experience morning rains. Afternoon showers are also expected over a few places, while nights are likely to be partly cloudy, though occasional showers may occur over a few places. Nationally, the weather forecast has confirmed that most parts of the country are likely to be sunny and dry. However rainfall is expected over some parts of the highlands East of Rift Valley, the Southeastern lowlands, Coast and Northeastern, during the first half of the seven-day forecast.
