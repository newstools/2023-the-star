 Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has claimed that the headquarters of the deep state, that was working to bloc their ascent to power was in Kirinyaga. The DP said despite all the intimidation and overtures, the people of Kirinyaga stood firm and voted for President William Ruto and the Kenya Kwanza administration. Referring to the former powerful Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho, Gachagua said the people of Kirinyaga refused to be coerced to support Azimio. “Mr President, the headquarters of the deep state was here, all the meetings to plan on how to finish you were being done here,” Gachagua said during a thanksgiving service in Kirinyaga. The DP said Kirinyaga rejected Narc Kenya boss Martha Karua who had been 'imposed on us as a running mate'. “They were even given the running mate position but these people(Kirinyaga) said no and supported us.” Karua was opposition leader's running mate under the Azimio la Umoja one Kenya coalition. He said the president had given Kirinyaga special attention because of how the region firmly stood with Kenya Kwanza despite all threats. “That is why the president has said special emphasis be given to Kirinyaga,” he said. The DP paraded senior officers from the county working in the office of the president saying the high number was testimony that the region is strategic.
