The Kenya Amateur Golf Championships (KAGC) Series tees off this weekend at the Sigona following the conclusion of the Nairobi District Foursome. The Foursome tournament, which is the curtain raiser for the Kenya Golf Union calendar, was played at the Muthaiga with Sigona pair of Akshay Chandaria and Sandeep Matharu emerging top. They beat Vet Lab’s pair of Isaac Makokha and Jackson Mwangi to the 2023 title. Eldoret long hitter Aron Kitur leads a host of North Rift golfers for the series opener (Sigona Bowl), which starts on Friday and runs till Sunday in a 54-hole showpiece. Playing handicap 4, Kitur will grace the event alongside clubmates Moses Tanui and Danny Chelogoi while Nelson Koech will lead the Nandi Bears duo of Elly Barno and Kimeli Kenduiwo. The Eldoret green keeper said that he has been training well at his home club of Eldoret to ensure he earns early points for the 2024 Magical Kenya Open. “I want to play in the first opening meetings but may skip some. I want early points because the earlier the better,” said Kitur. For young players like Barno, Chelogoi and Koech, he said the event is good for them as they seek to launch their campaign for international events. According to the KGU calendar of events, the Africa Region IV tournament is set for June 5-11 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and the Victoria Cup will be staged in Tanzania between June 22 and 25. “The three young players are eligible for the Team Kenya slots and the earlier they play and amass points, the bigger the chance for them. At the same time, they have to earn points ahead of the Magical Kenya 2024 edition,” added Kitur. Sigona Bowl will be followed by Mount Kenya Championships which will be held in February at the Nyeri Golf Club. After Nyeri, the Windsor Classic will be staged at the Windsor between March 3- 5 before the 2023 Magical Kenya Open at the Muthaiga.
