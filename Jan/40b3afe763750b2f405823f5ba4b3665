Speaker of the National Assembly Moses Masika Wetang'ula with his Senate counterpart Amason Kingi held several sideline meetings with different dignitaries and Kenyans living in Australia. The two speakers were attending this year’s Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth (CSPOC) at the Parliament of Australia. Usually, the CSPOC forum is conducted on a biennial and rotational basis. The forum brings together the Speakers and Presiding Officers of the national parliaments of the independent sovereign states of the Commonwealth. Wetang'ula and Kingi held bilateral talks with the President of the Australian Senate Sue Lines. The leaders discussed ways of enhancing Parliamentary diplomacy and democracy between Kenya and Australia. During the conference, Wetang'ula had a chance to engage the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, Anthony Rota on the sidelines of the CSPOC. The two traced the history of the great relationship that exists between the two Parliaments. They also sought to enhance the relationship through further Parliamentary engagements. Additionally, Wetang'ula and Kingi met and engaged with Kenyans livings in Australia through the Kenyan Embassy in Australia. This comes as the National Assembly recently amended its Standing Orders to increase the number of House Committees for the 13th Parliament Among them are the currently established Diaspora Affairs and Migrant Workers Committees that seek to tackle issues affecting Kenyans in the diaspora and ensure inclusivity in national matters and development. The just concluded CSPOC convention looked into various aspects of developing Parliamentary Institutions through promoting knowledge and understanding of parliamentary democracy. The speakers also deliberated on ways to maintain, foster and encourage impartiality and fairness on the part of Speakers and Presiding Officers of Parliaments.
