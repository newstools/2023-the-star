Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) coach Sammy Kiki is optimistic his charges will continue their climb to the top in the Kenya National Basketball League. Speaking after bagging maximum points from their two matches over the weekend, Kiki said they will keep working hard to move back to the top spot. "I am happy with the two wins. In both games, we started badly perhaps because of the long layoff," he said. He noted: "After half time, we were able to find our teamwork for both defence and offence and this enabled us to stop our opponents completely." KPA on Sunday dismissed Eldonets Platinum 72-36 as Byron Job and Benjamin Muga tallied 14 points each. They had won 72-35 against Strathmore University 'Blades' the previous day. "We have no injuries and we are now looking forward to our briefing on the next fixtures." The win pushed KPA to 25 points but they have played three games less than leaders Ulinzi Warriors who are on 29. Equity Bank Dumas are second with 28 points—same as Blades who have also played 18 games—three more than the bankers. The visiting Lakeside dismissed Zetech University Titans 52-32 with captain Silas Awuor expressing optimism that they will make the playoffs. "We can actually make the playoffs if we can manage to win two or three games," said Awuor. Awuor hit 10 points while Julius Okitoyi made 21 in that win. Strathmore University Swords are topping the ladies' chart with 30 points despite going down 72-35 to KPA in Mombasa. "We had had only eight players. I missed Edna Kola, Susan Manya and Alexander Juma who were all injured," said Owino. Three teams, KPA, Zetech Sparks and Equity Bank Dumas are second, third and fourth in that order. All are on 26 points. Defending champions are well placed to take the pile position ahead of the playoffs. They remain the only unbeaten side. They have played 13 matches.
