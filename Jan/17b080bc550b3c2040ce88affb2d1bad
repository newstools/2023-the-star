The key to successful leadership today is influence, not authority. This quote by management expert Ken Blanchard aptly captures President William Ruto’s visit to Nyanza at the weekend. Ruto’s move shows the desire of a leader who wants to keep his word to be the President for all Kenyans, a leader who hits the ground running to do his job. Nyanza is perceived to be an opposition stronghold. His visit to the region thus shows inclusiveness that the nation badly needs. To the naysayers, it has proved that no region will be left out regardless of how they voted. Nyanza and every other region should and must benefit from development because the government is for all Kenyans. President Ruto's efforts should be emulated by leaders both young and old on how to rally everybody together and serve all Kenyans without discrimination. Well done, Mr President. The people of Nyanza must also be congratulated for welcoming the President, who they did not vote for, contrary to what naysayers expected. This is commendable and demonstrates political maturity, from which the rest of the country needs to learn. The Kenya we need is one that is united and not divided along tribal lines.
