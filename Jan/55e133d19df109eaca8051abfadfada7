Former nominated senator Isaac Mwaura now says that Kenya has many counties. He said the 47 devolved units are too many and don't make any economic sense. The former senator said this has made the service delivery procedure more complicated than it should be. "I hold the view that we over-devolved. We cannot have 47 counties, they are not economically viable. I believe they were to be collapsed into 14 or 16, they would still make sense to Kenya. "I don't want to make suggestions because people will come at me but I think we over devolved and that has created a huge bureaucracy that is unnecessary and does not actually inspire confidence to service delivery," Mwaura said. His words come at the backdrop of earlier proposals by MPs to have the number of counties reduced. In 2016, Trade CS Moses Kuria who was then, Gatundu South MP wanted the counties reduced to 18 from 47. Kuria also wanted the number of MPs and Members of County Assemblies to bring down the cost of governing the country. Another proposal by then Mwingi Central legislator Joe Mutambu wanted the devolved units reduced to 25. In the same year, a section of Jubilee MPs also proposed the reduction of counties to 10, but none of the proposals was adopted. In 2020, Kuria East MP Marwa Kitayama has proposed the creation of five new counties to 52. The legislator wanted counties in Kuria, Teso, Mount Elgon, East Pokot and Mwingi.
