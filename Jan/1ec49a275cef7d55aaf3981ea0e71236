Only one invitee slot is remaining as preparation for the Magical Ladies Kenya Open (February 2-5) gathers momentum. Among the big names who have occupied 10 out of the possible 11 invitee spaces include two-time Indian Olympian Aditi Ashok, Florentyna Parker of England, Germany’s Karolin Lampert (Golf Club St. Leon-Rot) and Pasqualle Coffa from The Netherlands’ Bernardus Golf. Kenya’s amateur quartet of Naomi Wafula, Mercy Nyanchama, Chanelle Wangari (16) of VetLab Golf Club and Nancy Wairimu are also beneficiaries of the invitee section which also has high-flying 16-year-old Indian amateur Avani Prashanth. Prashanth become the first Indian golfer to compete at the Augusta National Women’s Amateur event: and will be spurred on by the strong presence of compatriots, including Aditi. The Indian prodigy was also among six young Indians who teed off at the Women’s Amateur Asia Pacific Championship in November last year. Also representing India are Vani Kapoor (DLF Golf and Country Club), Seher Atwal and Diksha Dagar . The Indians are enlisted in the oversubscribed MKLO entry which currently has a projected cut off of 96 players.
