Equity Bank Dumas hit Strathmore University Blades 62-55 in a Kenya National Basketball League tie at the United States International University (USIU) courts. The bankers took a 19-17 first quarter margin after an opening trey by Victor Ochieng but the losers’ Timothy Oyoo took over, collecting 14 of the students’ total. In the second quarter, it was still a tough battle as both teams fought hard to gain control of the game. Dumas hanged on 15-12. Strathmore were superb in the third quarter, going on a 10-0 run that saw them lead 39-34 midway through and 47-43 as the stanza ended. The bankers continued to chip into Blades lead, tying the duel 49-49 with 5:00 left to play in the deciding quarter and went for the kill after a 55-55 tie. “It’s a good win for us. Even though we didn’t play so well, our recovery was superb and this gave us the edge,” said Dumas’ coach Carey Oketch. Victor Bosire’s two points saw them away and after Garang Ding missed two foul shots, Cliff Alela took over and Blades succumbed. Cliff Alele deflated his old team as he sunk 14 points same as Victor Bosire. For the losers, Brandon Ouche scored 16 points to better Oyoo’s 14. “We just lost focus. Our guards didn’t control the ball well and our ball movement and rotation was not good at all,” fumed Blades’ coach Tony Ochieng. Blades, who are eyeing a top four finish, had the previous day succumbed 56-47 to former national champions Ulinzi Warriors. In the Lower Division matches at the same venue, Anthony Mbori hit the winning basket as Absa sunk Neosasa 40-39. The other game of the day saw Moi Air Base (MAB) come tops in an all-forces clash as they shot down Snipers 59-47. “After our loss to yesterday (Saturday), we came out strongly and I am happy with the way the boys responded,” said MAB coach Moses Shida. Wesley Wasuo bagged 17 points and Frank Masira added 12 for MAB, who also won the reverse fixture. The losers had 11 from Chris Warutere.
