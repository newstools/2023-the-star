An increasing change in taste by customers in the country is shifting the trends in technology uptake in Kenya. Smartphone customers are upping stakes and shifting from the traditional calls and messages to more work related uses by handsetS. This has prompted Smartphone maker Tecno to launch its flagship Phantom X2 and Phantom X2Pro in the country. Tecno Brand Manager Brian Otieno, speaking exclusively to The Star on the sidelines of the launch, said that an increasing number of employees are now using phones for more than just making calls and text messages. “Technology keeps advancing and the phones we used to bring in a few years ago were for everyday use, but now we are bringing solutions to consumers we don’t want to bring a phone that is cheap we want to bring a phone that offers solutions in terms of storage, camera multitasking for office,” said Otieno. The launch comes at a time that smartphone shipments declined in the third quarter of 2022 from increasing global inflation according to data by global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC). Otieno added that the device will be targeting Kenyans between the ages of 25 and 40 and will be looking to sell over 1000 units in the first month. The phone maker announced Kenyan Two-time Olympic champion, Eliud Kipchoge as the brand ambassador the flagship model. “We are soon launching the PHANTOM series which is available for preorder now, the PHANTOM X2 series 5G is among the world’s pioneering devices in terms of its Retractable Portrait Lens and renewable fiber back cover,” added Otieno Phantom X2 Series is available for pre-order between January 5, 2023 and January 18, 2023.
