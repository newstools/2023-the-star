Menengai Oilers and crosstown rivals Nakuru RFC face off at the Nakuru showground on Saturday as the Kenya Cup resumes after a three-week break. Oliers, last season's losing finalists, are placed second on the log with 19 points are expecting to showcase their new talents after going on a shopping spree during the December mid-season transfer window. They brought in seven players as they look at bolstering their roster with the aim of winning the Kenya Cup this time around. The Nakuru-based outfit signed Johnstone Mungau from Quins, Ezekiel Were from Nakuru, Timothy Lugalia from Shamas, Charles Osgood from Kisumu RFC, Henry Miheso from Daystar, Kevin Masibo from Kitale RFC and Herbert Ochieng from Meru University Coach Gibson Weru said the additions will bring competition to the side in what promises to be a gruelling second half of the season. “We have added depth to our squad and it gives me and the technical bench options to work with in our matches going forward,” added Weru. He said he expects a tough encounter from Nakuru, who are eighth on the log with six points. "Derby matches are the toughest to play. We know the quality Nakuru have and we must better them to get a positive result,” added Weru. Oilers have won two of the last five derbies, 31-5 in 2019 and 21-20 last year. The rest have ended in defeats with the last being a 13-8 humbling. Weru will rely on Chrispine Shitundo, Vincent Mwikhali, and Clinton Odhiambo in the forwards with Kenya Simbas internationals Geoffrey Ominde, John Okoth, Austin Sikutwa and Davis Nyaundi the pick of the backs. Nakuru will bank on Emmanuel Mboya, Barry Opondo and Cassius Omollo in the forward pack with Phillip Okeyo and Gilbert Ochieng lighting up the backline.
