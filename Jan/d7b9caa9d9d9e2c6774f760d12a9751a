Martin Kasavuli, son of late TV queen Catherine Kasavuli,  has said his mother wanted him to follow in her footsteps in media. Martin was speaking during the requiem mass for his mother on Thursday at the Friends International Church along Ngong Road. "One of the things that she always wanted me to do was to go into TV and broadcasting, I knew it was her way of telling me I will do as she wanted," Martin said. He added that he never wanted his mother to publicise him. "She was proud of me, but I liked her to keep it quiet. I did not want her to talk about me.  She asked me, 'but how would they know I have a child'!" Martin said the reason he did not want to join the media is that he feared he couldn't fill his mother's shoes. "The reason why I got scared was that the shoes to fill were too big, it was daunting for me. So, I went ahead and did law. Somehow, she had her way and found me in Radio Africa doing commercial advertising," Martin said. He said his job was always to be Catherine's bodyguard and they had a very special bond. Martin said his mother was her 'boyfriend'. Kasavuli passed away on December 29, 2022,  aged 60 at the KNH after battling cancer. The final service for her sendoff will take place at her rural home at Tigoi Primary School on Saturday, January 14.
