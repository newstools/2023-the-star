Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said President William Ruto should change the name of the Hustler Fund. Kalonzo said the name should not have the word "Hustler" because it is a nationally themed programme. "If I was the President,Â I wouldn't want to use Hustler because it is a national theme. Where is the legal framework of what you are calling the Hustler Fund?" he asked. He was speaking during an interview with NTV. Kalonzo wondered how Ruto expected the opposition in the National Assembly to support the fund with "the word Hustler". "I would rather if it comes to that, change the title. It's the same thing. If there are accolades to be made, they'll come to you anyway," he added. The Hustler Fund was launched on November 30, 2022, and is specifically designed to support small-scale traders in the country. The Fund comprises four products: personal, micro business, SME and start-up loans. In February, Ruto is expected to launch another product of the Sh50 billion kitty. Cooperatives and MSME Development CS Simon Chelugui said the product will be bigger and better; allowing Kenyans to borrow an amount ranging from Sh100,000 to Sh2.5 million. Further, the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance co-principal weighed in on the President's first 100 days in office. "Ruto's first 100 days have been a disaster. This administration said they are going to lower the cost of living within 100 days, which have come and gone," he said. The Wiper leader added that the government needed to feed its citizens, with the help of food subsidies or not. He further said Ruto needed to cross-examine his closest advisers and question some of the economic advisories they give.
