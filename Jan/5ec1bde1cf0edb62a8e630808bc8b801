Nairobi City Stars have filed an official complaint with Football Kenya Federation (FKF), and Fifa’s integrity office protesting over alleged match manipulation in their fixture against Bandari over the weekend. City Stars lost the game 2-1 at Mbaraki Sports. Simba wa Nairobi wants the game nullified and a replay ordered. Through the club’s chief executive officer Patrick Korir, City Stars want all those involved in alleged match manipulation expelled from football. Korir said: “Nairobi City Stars wishes to highlight what we and no doubt many others consider as acts of match manipulation. There were several incidents in the closing part of the match that led us to believe the same including the unjustified prolongation of the match, as well as a chain of events leading to a dubious award of a penalty.” In a statement, Korir said their views have been corroborated by many who watched the game, both in the stadium and online. “The match only came to an end after the penalty award, which can be seen as being awarded subsequent to simulation. Bandari scored from the spot kick to win the game 2-1,” Korir said. Korir further added that City Stars will not relent when such individuals determine outcomes of games for reasons best known to themselves at the expense of clubs that have and continue to commit sizeable resources to support and provide a livelihood to the youth. “Match manipulation is something that has been endemic in Kenyan football for far too long and, as a club run in order to support and benefit our community, we will certainly not stand for it.  We are willing to fight for the change we want to see and will fight tirelessly for it,” added Korir. Several clubs have in the recent past protested over alleged match manipulation.
