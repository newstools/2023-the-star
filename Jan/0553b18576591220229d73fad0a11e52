ODM leader Raila Odinga has sent a message of condolences to the family and friends of the late Issa Abdul Faraj. Faraj, who was the chairman of the Council of Elders died on Monday. "I offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Mzee Issa Abdul Faraj, Chairman of the Nubian Council of Elders," Raila said. He described Faraj as a true leader and advocate for the rights and causes of the Nubian Community in Kenya. "Poleni sana kwa msiba. Inna Lillahi wa Inailayhi Rajiun." President William Ruto also mourned Faraj, describing him as a pillar in the Nubian Community. "We mourn with the Nubian Community following the passing of Issa Abdul Faraj. Mr Faraj, who served as the chairman of the Council of Elders, was a pillar of the community," Ruto said. Nubians have been existing in Kenya since 1817. They are the first army ever in Kenya to a subject of Kings' African rifles. The community has been calling on the government to speed up the process of their recognition in Kenya. The group said it has been facing discrimination regarding the legitimacy of its citizenry.
