Kenya Simbas Simbas forward Bethwell Anami has joined the French Division 3 outfit, Stade Caennais RFC. The 24-year-old back row has penned a one-year renewable contract with the French club.  On their website, the French club said they were delighted to have signed the Kenyan. “We are pleased with the arrival of Bethwell Anami Muteshi from Strathmore University. This back-rower international Kenya rugby at 15s and Sevens player will play a key role in supporting our team,” the statement read in part. Anami, who weighs 103 kilos will be keen to make a mark at his new club in France. Anami's former  Strathmore Leos coach Louis Kisia said the move is huge for Anami and Kenyan Rugby “I'm delighted for him. His game will grow and will help the Simbas in future international assignments as well as open other doors for other players in the French League, which is considered one of the best," added Kisia. The tactician observed that Kenya needed more players to play in the professional ranks in Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. “It will greatly boost our rugby prospects and chances of qualifying for the Rugby World Cup in years to come,” added Kisia. He becomes the second Kenya Simbas star to play professional rugby after fellow forward Malcolm Onsando who is based in Romania for CS Dinamo Bucuresti. Anami attracted the interest of the French club after outstanding displays for the Simbas during the Rugby World Cup qualifier held in France last year as well as the Currie Cup in South Africa. Anami was a key cog for Strathmore Leos in the past four seasons, helping the varsity side to two Kenya Cup semifinals in the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 seasons. He helped St Peter's Mumias win the East Africa Schools School title in 2016. Stade Caennais are currently ranked third on the log with 30 points with their next match set for January 30 against RC Post.
