Opposition leader Raila Odinga has now called for the resignation of President William Ruto. According to Raila, Ruto did not win the August 9 2022 presidential election, insisting that he was in office illegally. He said they have facts showing that he won the election. "I'm saying as a proud African that Africa should not be judged by different standards. If something is not accepted in Europe, it should not be accepted in Africa. What I'm saying is facts that are there show that Mr William Ruto did not win an election. He lost. "I won and so he's there illegally and what we are going to demand is that Mr Ruto should resign and let Kenyans have their will," Raila said in a video shared by ODM Communications Director Phillip Etale on Saturday. The former Prime Minister said indeed Ruto is a man of God and respects the law, he should step down and let the people of Kenya have their will. "The people's will is God's will and that is what should happen.Â He says that he is a man of God, he respects righteousness and the rule of law. So let him follow. Live up to what he has been prophesying." This comes a few days after Azimio claimed they had received a report from a whistleblower who works with the IEBC detailing how he was rigged out. He said he won by over 2 million votes. Raila is on Sunday holding a mega rally at the Jacaranda grounds dubbed "No Handshake" where he is expected to give 'further directions' to his supporters. Raila in the video added that the evidence they have shows that they were voted for overwhelmingly in Central region where their opponents claim they didn't receive many votes. "I want to thank them for their patriotic duty. What happened is not their mistake. Their will was subverted by agents of impunity at the Bomas of Kenya," he said.
