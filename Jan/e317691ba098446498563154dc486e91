Starting in February, Instagram has announced that it will be simplifying its in-app navigation, removing the Shop tab. Instagram has redesigned its home screen to bring the Create shortcut tab to the shortcuts at the bottom of the app page. On the bottom page, the app page originally had the Reels shortcut at the centre, the Shop tab to the right as well as the Profile tab, and the Search and Home tabs to the left. Instagram introduced this layout in 2020 with a focus on Reels and the Shop shortcut which had dedicated tabs and moved the Create and Activity shortcut tabs to the top right corner next to Direct Messages. The navigation bar at the bottom of the app will now have the shortcut for creating content in the centre and Reels to the right. As part of this change, Instagram has stated that the Instagram Shop tab will be removed. Through a video posted on his Twitter page, the Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri said that the change will make it easier for people to share and connect with their friends and interests. The new navigation bar will have the home, search, create, reels, and profile shortcuts. Mosseri said that Instagram is removing the Shops tab but users will still be able to shop on Feed, in Stories, Reels, and ads. “We are trying to bring people together over what they love. As a reminder, to do that we are focused on three things,” he said. “On inspiring people to express themselves, on helping people discover what they love and on sparking connections between people over what they find.” The new changes will begin rolling out in February.
