Traffic flow will be disrupted along the Eastern bypass for three days as Kura seeks to have final touches on the road. In a notice dated Sunday, January 29, 2023, the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) announced that a section of the Eastern bypass will remain closed for three days This is to allow the contractor to lay the final surface dressing at the section between Embakasi Barracks and China Roads and Bridges Corporation (CRBC) site camp. "We wish to notify the general public that there will be traffic disruption along Eastern Bypass from 6 am Monday, January 30 to February 1, 6 pm,” the notice reads in part. The stretch from China Roads and Bridges Corporation (CRBC) site camp to the Embakasi barracks heading towards Mombasa Road will be affected. The disruption would mean that the outbound lane would be shared by motorists along the affected section. However, traffic marshals and police will be on-site to guide motorists so as to enable a smooth flow of traffic. As a result, Kura has asked drivers plying the route to exercise more caution. “Kindly bear with the situation as we endeavour to enhance urban mobility," the agency said. The expansion of the Eastern Bypass into a dual carriageway at Sh12.5 billion started in November 2021. This was after the signing of a contract between Kura and the China Communication Construction Company who will be completing the Sh12.5 billion project. The bypass, one of the Vision 2030 infrastructure projects, was designed during the term of the Grand Coalition government. The expansion is part of 11 infrastructure projects that the Kenyan government delegation showcased to global investors during the two-day Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation in Beijing, China, in May 2017. Others include the expansion of both the Southern and Northern bypasses.
