Kenya Lionesses received a major boost yesterday with the arrival of Spain-based centre Mercy Wanyama. Subsequently, Mercy was expected to join team training last evening, according to  Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) assistant secretary Angela Luchivya. Mercy is a younger sister to legendary former international Harambee Stars midfielder MacDonald Mariga and Victor Wanyama, who currently plies his trade with CF Montreal in Major League Soccer in the USA.  "Mercy is around and joins the team's training today," said Luchivya confirmed that Mercy, who plies her trade with the Spanish side AD Cortegada, is already in the country and raring to go. She said other diaspora players are expected to join the team from February 5 when the international window is on. Victoria Reynolds (Immortal Tcars, Portugal) as well as the USA-based trio of Felmas Koranga (Troy University), Ruth Mbugua (Danville Christian Academy) and Eunice Silong (Bryant & Stratton College) are expected early next month. The local-based players have been training for the last two weeks and move into the residential camp Monday. "This week, they have been training twice a day from 6.30 to 9.30 am then at 4 pm to 6:30 pm," said Luchivya. Head coach George Mayienga said they have upped their training and everything is going on well with 15 players having reported. "We are moving on well. The numbers have gone up and this is good for us as we have a full squad to run our sessions," offered Mayienga. "Today (yesterday),  the turnout was good and only Medina Okot missed out as she had her classes in the morning. But she is available.". Mayienga is being assisted by veteran tactician Anthony Ojukwu and Eunice Ouma with Sylvia Kamau as the team manager. The Lionesses are preparing for the FIBA AfroBasket/All Africa Games Zone Five Qualifiers set for Kampala, Uganda from February 12-19. Kenya are expected to battle regional rivals Egypt, Rwanda, Tanzania, Burundi, South Sudan, Ethiopia and host Uganda.
