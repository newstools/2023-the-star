A 17-year-old boy is reported to have been detained by the police in Nigeria for impregnating more than 10 women. According to a Nigerian news agency, PUNCH, the Rivers State Police Command in Nigeria uncovered and shut down the operation of a baby factory in Obio/Akpor and Ikwerre local government areas of the state. Four suspects have been arrested in connection with the illegal operation and ten pregnant girls have been rescued. According to the police, the teen and 29-year-old Chigozie Ogbonna were recruited by this group which opened a factory to produce children for commercial purposes. "The leader of the syndicate, Peace Alikoi who is 40 years old, would then take care of the children and pay the mothers N500,000 (KES 138,406). Some babies were also sold. The police have also arrested 30-year-old Favor Bright in connection with the operation," Punch reported. The police were tipped off about the operation and acted quickly based on the information and raided two houses of the Igwuruta and Omagwa communities where the victims were kept. The victims, most of whom were pregnant, were rescued and taken into custody for further investigation. The police have also found a Honda Pilot Jeep from the leader of the syndicate. "All the victims admitted that they were lured into child trafficking because of the need to face some financial challenges," Iringe-Koko, the police coordinator told Punch. The case has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department and efforts are being intensified to track down and arrest the buyers of children who have already been sold. "We will not rest until all those involved in this heinous act are brought to justice and held accountable for their actions," Iringa-Koko added.
