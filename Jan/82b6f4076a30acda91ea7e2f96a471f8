Interior CS  Kindiki Kithure has said the government is fully engaged to ensure that durable peace prevails in Turkana West. Kindiki was speaking on Friday in Turkana during his tour of Lokichogio and Nadapal to access the security situation and the general development of the area. He said this will facilitate the extension of the Kitale-Lodwar-Kakuma-Lokichogio-Nadapal road to Nakodoe and onward to Juba, South Sudan. "Completion of this key road will be followed by water and Social Infrastructure projects to open the area for development, facilitate trade and movement of labor between Kenya and South Sudan and unlock the full economic potential of the region," Kiture said. The CS said an Anti Stock Theft Unit (ASTU) Camp will be set up in the area immediately. He said the strength of the General Service Unit (GSU) and National Police Reservists (NPR) will also be enhanced and cross-border peace committees set up on both sides of the border. He was in the company of the Turkana Security and Intelligence Committee and elected leaders led by Governor of Turkana Jeremiah Lomurkai.
