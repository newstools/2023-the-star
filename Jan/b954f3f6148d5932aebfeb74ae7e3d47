President William Ruto and his senior government officials have retreated to Sagana State Lodge to discuss national issues. The meeting brings together Cabinet secretaries, presidential advisers, and principal secretaries. The four-day retreat is reviewing the steps the Kenya Kwanza administration has made in 100 days since assuming office and will plan ahead. As the President and his team put together a strategy for 2023, it is important that the plan comprises short, medium and long-term objectives with clear timelines and deliverables. Atop the list is how to ensure sustainable food security, revive the ailing economy as quickly as possible, create new jobs for millions of jobless Kenyans, enhance government services, improve security and most importantly, create enabling environment for Kenyans to thrive. Previously, the Cabinet has retreated only to come back and continue with business as usual. President Ruto, who prides himself as a hardworking man, needs to ensure that the plan is fully implemented. Any Cabinet Secretary who fails to deliver should be fired without hesitation, while those who will deliver should be rewarded for the good work. The President should also align his national government priorities with the 47 counties so that there is synergy and clear focus in development.
