Friends of the man who died on January 17 at Titanic Dam in Juja, Kiambu, gathered at the scene on Saturday to mourn him. They mourned Gikonyo as a staunch businessman and a friend who loved to help the less fortunate in society. The friends were joined by Murera MCA Moses Ngatha. They urged the members of the public to be always watchful during the visit. John Mwangi a resident said it was very unfortunate that the two lost their lives. "We regret that the two perished when they had come to rewind their mind," he said. Ngatha told the Star that friends will also meet on Sunday from 5 pm for prayers and pay condolences to the family. "They park and chill around here every day but during the weekends you cannot even find a parking spot here, they flock here, drinking and enjoying themselves here," Ngatha said. He urged members of the public to come out in large numbers including church leaders. "We have met here to remember the two friends who perished and on Sunday, we will also hold a similar vigil," he said. He said he will lobby for the creation of a recreation park at the site that will be well constructed to avoid any further calamity. He said the park would also serve as a memorial park for Maina Gikonyo and his friend. He urged the Agriculture county department to use the water to rear fish and also for irrigation. "I would like to appeal to the government and external donors to join hands and rescue the situation and use the water mass in a positive way that would impact youths in the area," he said. He said that the act of empowering the youths will rescue them from drug abuse and impact them positively.
