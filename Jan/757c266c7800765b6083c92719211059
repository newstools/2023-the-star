Geoffrey Korir leads star-studded Kenya Prisons team to the National Cross Country Championships to be held on Saturday at the Prisons Staff Training College (PSTC) in Ruiru, Kiambu County. Korir will have Peter Emase and William Matelong for company in what is expected to be a competitive senior men's 10 km race. It promises to be a battle royale between Prisons, Kenya Police and Kenya Defence Forces in the one day event. Police will be led by Africa 5000m champion Robert Kiprop and Edwin Bett . Defence forces are led by Alfred Barkach while South Rift will be represented by the likes steeplechaser Leonard Bett, Wesley Ledama and Vincent Mutai. Defending champions Samuel Chebolei from North Rift and Kenya Defence Forces’ (KDF’s) Joyce Chepkemoi have the given the event a wide berth. In the women's 10 km race all eyes will be on KDF's Sheila Chepkirui and Esther Borura. They, however, face competition from 2019 world marathon champion Ruth Chepngetich who will be representing Prisons alongside steeplechaser Fancy Cherotich. The law enforcers  will be represented by champion Stacy Ndiwa, 2013 World 5,000m silver medallist Mercy Cherono and former world 10,000m champion Linet Masai. The country's top athletes will however miss the event as they are currently training in Kigari, Embu County ahead of next month's World Cross County Championships in Bathurst, Australia. Last month, Athletics Kenya brought forward the national trials to give themselves time to navigate the stringent Australian visa processing timelines. Missing in action on Saturday will be the likes of world half marathon silver medallist Kibiwott Kandie, who won the KDF title a fortnight ago, world 3000m steeplechase record holder Beatrice Chepkoech and former world cross champion Geoffrey Kamworor of Police. Also absent is world 10,000m silver medallist Helen Obiri.
