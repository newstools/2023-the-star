The Supreme Court deserves commendation for the recent decision that discourages automatic recognition of cohabitation as marriage. The court discouraged people who might want to get into cohabitation with no intention of marriage but when dispute arises, opt to dash to court to waste judicial time. The most logical thing to do as couples is to endeavor to have the marriage recognized under the law either by going to the AGâ€™s office, opting for a customary marriage or the religious option. This will make it easy for courts to deal with matrimonial disputes and reduce the time used to determine cases probably by half since the parties will not have to first the establish existence of the marriage. However, courts should not also use the decision to issue a blanket condemnation to genuine cases of couples who have cohabited and probably even have children. Society is evolving and some might opt to cohabit for whatever reason and get children and in such cases, courts should shy away from breaking families apart just because they did not present a marriage certificate. In such cases, courts should use its discretion to assume that such a couple is married and protect their family unit in the best interest of the children.
