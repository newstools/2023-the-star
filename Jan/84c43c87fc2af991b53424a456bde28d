Elani singer Maureen Kunga says everyone should create their happiness in marriages. Maureen has been in marriage for about three years. Speaking to Buzz Central, Maureen shared some lessons about the institution. "I've learnt to trust myself, to trust my opinions, to let go," she said. "I used to be a controlling lady in terms of my feelings. I thought the road was straight in life. Let me tell you, you will swiftly learn that other people have lists. Life is just a beautiful thing." Her advice to women waiting to settle down is that there is no part of life that is a fairy tale. "I think you can romanticise your own life. You put in the work to make sure your life is as happy as you want it to be but don't entrust that happiness, fairy tale, to anyone else because you can't control what other people do, what they think," she said. "People sometimes put their happiness in a job. For example, when Covid happened, some people put their hope in a family member, in marriage. God forbid even that person passes away." She added that people should create their own happiness. Musically, she said Elani is still together. "It's like we are married, so there is never an apart," she said. "However, I think having met each other so young, we've grown up together. So you get to a place where you also say, act, or get into other businesses."
