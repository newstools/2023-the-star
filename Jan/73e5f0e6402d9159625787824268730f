Turkana County and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have pledged to work together to improve the Early Childhood Development Education (ECD) centres. They said they will continue working together to encourage the use of e-based tools for data processing and to improve kitchen garden projects within Turkana's early childhood development centres. Leah Audan, Turkana County Executive for Education assured JICA that the County is committed to creating a conducive environment for JICA and other donor agencies to revamp the Education, Sports and Social protection sectors. “The electronic tools would provide more reliable data for better decision making and pointed out that JICA had supported knowledge transfer by training ECD staff on the use of Continuous Database Updating System (CODUSYS),” Audan said during the meeting with JICA on Friday in Lodwar. She said she plans to conduct a supervisory visit to all the departments' installations. She has urged JICA to increase the number of ECDs covered by CODUSYS technology. Audan, Turkana County Government recognize children's welfare, sports and social protection as critical sectors and expressed her delight in collaborating with JICA on furthering the vision. JICA, led by Murakami Fumiaki, pledged to support Turkana County during the 5th National ECDE Conference. According to Murakami, JICA was seeking to establish local expertise that could sustainably support the ECD sector through the use of reliable data derived from both the CODUSYS application and the TECDEMIS system.
