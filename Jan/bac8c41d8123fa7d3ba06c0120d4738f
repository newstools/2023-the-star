KCB rugby team beat the Ngong Road-based Mwamba 82-10 to extend their winning streak in the Kenya Cup at the Madaraka grounds Felix Ojoo, Peter Waitere, Darwin Mukidza and Michael Kimwele scored tries in the first half to give the bankers a commanding 42-7 lead at the interval. Despite the faultless display, bankers' coach Mariko Mushilla downplayed the importance of the huge win, saying their focus is on the next assignment. The Ruaraka-based side take on Strathmore Leos on January 21. “I am very happy with how the boys played in a compact manner but the result against a solid opponent deserves credit. However, we’re taking a game at a time, and we hope we will continue with the same fighting spirit when we face our next opponent." A moment of individual brilliance from Kenyan International  Mukidza earned KCB a bonus point after he excellently ran past the Mwamba’s defence to score his try. Bob Muhati opened the scores in the second half, before Martin Owilla, Davies Chenge and Ojoo’s second try of the game sealed the win for the lions. Mwamba’s only try came in the first half through their skipper Eliakim Kichoi and received a penalty in the second half. KCB currently sit at the summit of the 2022-23 Kenya Cup League.
