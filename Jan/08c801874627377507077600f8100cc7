Shabana moved eight points at top of the FKF National Super League after a hard-fought 1-0 win against Mombasa Heroes at Mbaraki Sports ground in Mombasa on Monday afternoon. Dependable midfielder Peter Ogechi scored the all-important goal for the Glamour Boys. The lanky midfielder has now scored four goals for the former Kenya Premier League side. Following the win, Shabana moved to 25 points from nine games. Kibera Black Stars have 17 points. However, the Kisii-based team have played one more game. Shabana and Kibera Black Stars will face off on February 8 at Ligi Ndogo grounds in a top-of-the-table clash that is expected to be explosive. Shabana coach Sammy Okoth said: “Playing at 1 pm was not easy for my boys but I’m happy we picked the three points. It’s always not easy to get maximum points from Mombasa. I want to congratulate my boys for the win.” He added: “We have now put behind the win against Coastal Heroes and the focus is on our next game against Kibera Black Stars. Our target is to win all games because you can’t get promoted if you don’t win your games,” added Okoth. Shabana organizing secretary, Stephen Kiama, protested the decision by the referee to disallow the team’s second goal. “We scored the second goal from a rebound but the referee disallowed it. I don’t know if the rules of the game have changed,” said Kiama. Murang’a Seals moved to third on the log after a 3-1 win over beleaguered Vihiga United at Mumias Sports Complex while Mara Sugar climbed to fourth after beating Mully Children’s Family (MCF) 1-0 at Awendo Green Stadium.
