Tatu City has completed 50 kilometres of tarmacked roads in the 5,000-acre Special Economic Zone on Nairobi’s doorstep. The transport infrastructure serves more than 75 businesses in Tatu City, as well as thousands of residents and school children. “The latest roads at Tatu City include the extension of the Tatu City 301 by 1.5 kilometre and the ongoing rollout of roads in the Kijani Ridge neighbourhood,” a statement from Rendeavour, the firm behind the development says. The city is located 20 kilometres north of Nairobi in the Ruiru Municipality area of Kiambu county. It sits within the greater Nairobi Metropolitan region and is a flagship project of the Kenya Vision 2030 blueprint. In the statement, Tatu City said it subjects all its roads to rigorous evaluation using the International Roughness Index (IRI). “An assessment conducted in cooperation with the Materials Testing and Research Division (MTRD) of the Ministry of Transport gave Tatu City roads high rankings for road quality and performance.” Tatu City has two schools – Crawford International and Nova Pioneer, which have more than 3,000 students, thousands of apartments by Unity Homes and family residences at Kijani Ridge. Eneo at Tatu Central, Tatu City’s first commercial office and retail complex will be completed in 2023.
