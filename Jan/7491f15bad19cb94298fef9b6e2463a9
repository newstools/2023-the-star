The Vihiga government in collaboration with Kaimosi Friends University intends to establish a climate change institute. The institute will offer short professional courses for climate change stakeholders in the public and private sectors. It will also develop a climate information service, climate change action- based research and knowledge exchange. Environment executive Anne Chilande on Friday led a team from the directorate of climate change in a meeting with university management to deliberate on the issue. Chilande praised the varsity for the undertaking to become the pioneer institution in championing matters of climate change and mitigation. She urged the institution to carry out intensive research in this area so that the findings can be used to tackle adverse effects of climate change. Acting deputy vice chancellor academics and student affairs Prof Julius Kipkemboi told the team that they have sensitised students on climate change and encouraged them to engage in environmental conservation activities like tree planting. He said they have developed a community outreach programme where they disseminate information on the need for environmental conservation and protection.
