Business people in Nairobi will have to wait for two months to get the unified single business permit. Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja on Tuesday announced that the process is 85 per cent complete. “By March, Nairobi will have a unified single business permit. The process is almost complete and I ask residents to be patient,” he said. Sakaja explained that his Deputy Njoroge Muchiri is in charge of the process and he has weekly meetings with experts on the matter. “I have told my Deputy to speed up the matter as business people renew their licenses between January and March,” he said. Sakaja was speaking during an interview at Inooro Tv. DG Njoroge Muchiri is in charge of the managerial duties of the county. He will also be in charge of licensing which according to him, is among the biggest challenges faced in Nairobi. Before the August 2022 elections, Sakaja pledged to introduce a single QR-enabled permit which he said will prevent the need of having multiple licences and subsequently eliminate the hurdles of doing business. "We shall unify the licenses so that it will be easier and faster for people to pay revenue and it will improve the county’s collection,” he said. The business permits are city council business permits, fire inspection certificates, food handler certificates, food hygiene, goodwill, and land rates for those who own land within the Nairobi jurisdiction. These business permits and licenses are renewed yearly by members of the public and the business community.
