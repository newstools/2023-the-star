Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said it's time everybody accepts that President William Ruto is the leader and move on. Speaking when he visited late prof Magoha's residence on Saturday, Gachagua said its time to work as the government is already made up. "We are saying, we are the government for now, let us work, let everybody accept and move on.Â You know life is like that, we will have a chance in the future say in 2027. Go back to the ballot and let the people decide," he said. "For now, President Ruto is the leader, that is why he has sent me here to bring support to this home because he is the one responsible for government and takes care of every Kenyan and it's in that capacity that he has acknowledged and recognised the late Prof Magoha for his distinctive service to the country." The DP said they will still continue to work and help where possible because it is duty to help where they can. "We will continue working for the next four years and some months." Gachagua also said the government will provide the necessary support to the family of the late Prof George Magoha to ensure he gets a befitting send-off. As part of the support, Gachagua announced that a Kenya Airforce helicopter will be availed to airlift the body from Nairobi to his Gem home in Siaya.
