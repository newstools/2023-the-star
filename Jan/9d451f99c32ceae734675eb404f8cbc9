President William Ruto has assured Kenyans that the country is on the right path to economic recovery. Addressing the country from State House, Mombasa in a brief ceremony to welcome 2023, Ruto said he had to take the bold step of removing subsidies as a long-term solution to the economic situation facing the country when took over power. Ruto said the removal of subsidies has had a positive impact on the economy with more income generated from tax collected. "I have had to take bold measures to ensure the country is recovering. The removal of subsidies was necessary to get our country back on the economic recovery," Ruto said. He added that there was no way the country would have continued with subsidies and remained afloat economically. He termed it as a strategy deployed for political expediency. Ruto said the government has rolled out a raft of measures to ensure its revenue collection doubles. He said this will enable the country to develop based on its resources and not through debts. Ruto said that he has drawn lessons from Former President Mwai Kibaki's school of thought that a country cannot prosper through excess borrowing. He assured Kenyans that though the measures may now result in dire consequences, they will in the long run appreciate the benefits that will be realized. Leaders present at the function were Mombasa governor Abdulswamad Nassir, Lamu governor Issa Timamy, Senate Speaker Amason Kingi, Mohammed Ali (Nyali MP) Badi Twalib(Jomvu MP) Mohammed Machele(Mvita MP) Rueda Obo (MP Lamu East) Kassim Tandaza (Matuga MP)among others.
