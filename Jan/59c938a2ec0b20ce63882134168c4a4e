Narok Governor Patrick Ole Ntutu has ignited a political storm with Senator Ledama Ole Kina ahead of President William Ruto's visit to the county. Speaking on Wednesday in regards to the President's anticipated visit to the county, followed by a Sunday service, Ntutu said Ledama may not grace the event. "Hakuna kitu tunamwambia, unajua yeye ni mtu wa TV hutatampata hapa kwa ground, unajua yeye ni mtu wa social media na TV, so yeye ataomba huko kwa social media," he said This is loosely translated as: We will not tell him anything, you know he is a social media and TV person, you will not find him at the stadium, so he can just have his own service on social media. Several leaders from the Kenya Kwanza administration will be in attendance, and Ntutu urged residents to attend. "Narok residents are invited to the service, President and his deputy will be in attendance and all Kenya Kwanza leaders are invited," he said. The Narok event will happen at the same time as Azimio La Umoja's Jacaranda rally, which Ledama is expected to attend. The parallel meetings will see another verbal political exchange between the leading coalitions in the country.
