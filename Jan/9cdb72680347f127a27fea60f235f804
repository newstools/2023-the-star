Vihiga County Executive Committee member for Sports Onzere Mulongo has urged local clubs to seek financial support from corporate sponsors to eradicate perennial financial deficiencies. Mulongo said clubs should target betting firms, financial institutions and even established small business within the county and beyond. “The county has been key in funding these clubs but delays in the remittance of money by the exchequer remains a big challenge,” Mulongo said. Vihiga County government supports various teams in the various league including the Kenyan Premier League, National Super League and the Women's Premier League. “We sponsor teams in the various league but currently we are facing a financial crisis that won’t allow us to support these clubs at the moment,” Onzere said. "Maybe the earliest we can get them some money is mid-February." Mulongo added that the teams should disclose how much they get from their respective federations. The CEC said they are also planning to review Sports Act to ensure the clubs are given what they deserve basing on the budget they have. “We want to weed out any ghost teams and as well help us facilitate those teams based on the league they play in, number of players and the range of coverage as per the tournament of participation,” added Mulongo.
