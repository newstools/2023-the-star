Lakers' striker Aurelia Opondo wants to reclaim her place in the national women's team after missing out on the Commonwealth Games last year. The African Games are set for Ghana later in the year. Opondo, 23, was on Sunday named the Most Valuable Player in the women's category to crown a fruitful year after helping Lakers to finish third in the eight-team league. Wazalendo's Cliff Omari was feted in the men's category. "My target is getting back my place on the national team. I was unlucky to miss out on Birmingham but I hope to be recalled for the African Games." "Winning the award came as a surprise.  Even though I have improved over the last year, I didn't expect that." Opondo scored two goals for the Lakers in the 2022-23 season that ended over the weekend. She made her national team debut as the youthful Kenya team grabbed bronze in the African Nations Championship in Ghana, in January 2022,  scoring twice in four matches. Opondo was the top scorer in the Super League in 2018, helping the lakeside club win a promotion to the Premier League with nine goals. Last year, she was part of the Kenya team that won the International Floorball Charity Cup trophy in Uganda. Opondo also scored twice in the Hockey five-a-side Africa World Cup qualifier in Egypt. "I want to maintain the standards. There's room for improvement. My conversion is wanting." Opondo must beat competition from the quintet of Alice Owiti, Naomi Kemunto, Eleanor Chebet, Grace Bwire and Gilly Okumu for a slot in the forward positions. "My work is cut out considering the quality field I compete with. My dream is to become a professional player in the future." Festus Onyango bagged the men's top scorer award after finding the back of the net 15 times. Strathmore Scorpions' Grace Bwire triumphed in the women's cadre. Clementine Nyongesa's 13 goals were enough to win the 'Golden Boot' in the women's Super League.
