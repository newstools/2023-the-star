Makadara MP George Aladwa has said the Hustler Fund kitty should be increased from Sh500 to Sh5,000 to boost small businesses. He said once the stake has been increased that’s the time Kenyans can now talk of those savings. “You can’t tell us of savings when we have no structures for that saving. Also, you can’t force me to save when what I have borrowed isn’t enough for what I want to do,” Aladwa said. The lawmaker spoke to Star newspaper via the phone on Thursday morning. He was reacting to the Head of State remarks made on Wednesday evening. Ruto said the money deducted from the Hustler Fund will be used to invest in government securities. "Government securities are the surest. There are no defaults or other problems," he said. The President said the government has come up with an organisation, which has been licensed by the RBA to manage the savings. He said once investments begin, everyone who has saved through the Hustler Fund will be able to view the amount through an application. "Once we start the investment, the available application will show how much a borrower has saved and profit gained," Ruto said. Aladwa however criticised the move saying the fund itself has no proper legislative structures on how it should be managed and those savings might turn out to be a scam. However, Ruto had said the Hustler Fund is anchored in law and licenced to serve Kenyans. “Let us not look on how the fund is structured. What we need to focus on is, is the kitty achieving the intended purpose?” the president said.
