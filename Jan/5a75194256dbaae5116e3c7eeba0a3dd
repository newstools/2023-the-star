Sifuna talked about how he did not have the opportunity to watch her since he was raised in the village and they did not have a TV set. He said his wife had a crush on media personality Jimmy Gathu. "If my wife who grew up in Nairobi was here, she would be losing her mind because she had known you all media people, I think she had a crush on Jimmy Gathu was the man that was supposed to be with some other guy who sings called Usher. Lakini mimi ndio niko." Sifuna described Kasavuli as a national treasure. Sifuna recently said he had always had a crush on award-winning actress Sarah Hassan. He revealed that was why he accepted an invitation to attend the just concluded Kalasha awards. Speaking during the event, he narrated; "I will admit that I accepted the invitation because I had a strong desire to meet a lady whom I have admired for many years, she is called Sarah Hassan but I have not seen her," the Senator revealed The mother of one downplayed the story as she asked her friend to stop joking around. "Una mchezo master ( you have jokes master)," Sarah wrote while adding laughing emojis not disputing the new name though.
