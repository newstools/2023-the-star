A survey conducted by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that women in rural areas are more fertile than their counterparts in urban areas. The Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2022, was conducted among women between the ages of 15 to 49 (in age groups of five years) for the 3-year period preceding the survey that was released in 2023. According to the survey, women in rural areas have a total fertility rate of 3.9 while those in urban stand at 3. The total fertility rate refers to the average number of children a woman would have by the end of her childbearing years if she bore children at the current age-specific fertility rates. Over the years, the total fertility rate has declined. "Between 1989 and 2022, the TFR declined by 3 children from 7 to 3," the survey showed. Women in rural areas have reduced the number of children they give birth to from 7 to 4 children. "Among urban women, the TFR declined from 5 to 3 children," the survey showed. According to the survey, if fertility were to remain constant at current levels, a woman in Kenya would bear an average of 3 children in her lifetime. The survey also showed that fertility is low among adolescents aged 15â€“19 with 73 births per 1,000 women. Fertility peaks at 179 births per 1,000 among women aged 20 to 24 years and then decreases thereafter.
