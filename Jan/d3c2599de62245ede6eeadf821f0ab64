A high level delegation of the Chinese Communist Party is expected to visit the country in February. This was revealed by the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party Secretary General Veronica Maina on Friday. Maina on Friday hosted Counsellor Wang Jian Qiang and First Secretary Zhang Weijie who paid a courtesy call at the party headquarters located at the Hustler Plaza. “They briefed the party on the intended visit of a High-Level delegation of Chinese Communist Party official delegation slated to happen in February 2023,” she said via her twitter. “UDA and CPC are expected to exchange ideas on party-building mechanisms, general party governance and other issues of mutual interest,” she added. The Chinese Communist Party is the founding and ruling political party of modern China, officially known as the People’s Republic of China. President William Ruto’s UDA party registered huge wins in the by-elections held on January 5, reaffirming his firm control of his political strongholds. The ruling party easily retained parliamentary seats in Elgeyo Marakwet, Kandara and Garissa Township, affirming its solid presence in the President’s political bastions. In Kandara constituency, Murang’a county, UDA’s Chege Njuguna won the parliamentary seat to cement Ruto’s popularity in the Mt Kenya region. Former Agriculture minister Kipruto Arap Kirwa early this month said that the UDA party will remain a hollow empty shell without Ruto adding that the party has become what it is because of Ruto and it cannot survive without him.
