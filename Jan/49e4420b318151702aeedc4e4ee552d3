The National Treasury has called on members of the public to give their feedback on the draft of the 2023-2024 budget. The Budget Policy Statement unveiled today sets out the priority programs, policies and reforms of the administration that will be implemented. In the proposal, Ruto's administration seeks to scale up revenue collection efforts by KRA to Sh3 trillion in the 2023-2024 financial year as part of the economic turnaround plan. They said they wished to get the feedback of the public and involved parties to be put into consideration before the budget is finalised. “We are seeking the views of the public, the Commission on Revenue Allocation, county governments, Controller of Budget, Parliamentary Service Commission, Judicial Service Commission, and other interested parties,” they said. Treasury has said that feedback should be sent to them at bps@treasury.go.ke and copied to kenyabudgetpolicystatemnet@gmail.com by January 24. “After the feedback has been received and considered, the draft will be submitted to the Cabinet and subsequently, to Parliament,” they said.
