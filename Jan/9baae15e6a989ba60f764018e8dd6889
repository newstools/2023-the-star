Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Saturday morning trekked Mt Kenya as the Cabinet retreats in Nanyuki. Gachagua said he experienced a certain calmness about nature that reminds him of who we are as human beings even as he said he had prayed for President William Ruto's leadership. "To come this close to the wonders of the world and to marvel at the works of God is a truly refreshing experience. Mt. Kenya is mythical. It is mysterious," he said. "Facing Mount Kenya, I prayed to 'Mwene Nyaga' to give good health and wisdom to our Great Leader President William Ruto as he embarks on the economic transformation of our nation and the restoration of the dignity of the Kenyan people. Mlima is calm, steady, and stoic na iko sawa," he said. He added that he took time to thank God for his mercy and kindness to the people of Kenya and for giving us the freedom we are now enjoying . He said that the mountains, lakes, rivers, oceans, and forests in the country are a strong link to our roots. "This is a reminder of the greatness of our past and the possibilities in our collective future," he said.
