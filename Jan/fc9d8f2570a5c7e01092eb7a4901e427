Political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi has said President William Ruto will take over Mulembe Nation from Azimio chief Raila Odinga Ngunyi took to Twitter on Wednesday noting that Ruto had succeeded in all his previous takeovers. "Ruto wrestled the Kalenjin nation from mzee Moi. Did he succeed? Yes. Then he took the Gema nation from Uhuru Kenyatta. Did he succeed? Yes. Now he wants to wrestle the Mulembe nation from Raila. Will he succeed? Yes. Any questions?" he tweeted. In the August election, Prime CS Musalia Mudavadi and Speaker Moses Wetang'ula helped Ruto garner up to 70 per cent votes from western region, which was previously known to vote for the Azimio chief. Mudavadi delivered 76 per cent of votes in his polling station. Wetang'ula on the other hand delivered 78 per cent of votes in his polling station. Ruto has aggressively been making tours into areas considered to be Raila’s traditional bases since taking power. Immediately after ascending to power, Ruto embarked on endearing Raila men elected on the Azimio ticket and those who lost in the election. The President has also made deliberate tours of the country during which he holds meetings with the area's leadership and gives out development projects, in what many believe is meant to entice the regions to his side. Some of the opposition regions that have been on the Ruto’s radar include the Coast, Kisii, Nyanza and Western.
