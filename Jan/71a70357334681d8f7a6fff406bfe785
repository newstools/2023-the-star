Former Commissioner General of Prisons Isaya Mosiori Osugo is dead. A family spokesman said Osugo died at the Nairobi Hospital on Monday night after a short illness. He had been admitted to the the Intensive Care Unit for days over undisclosed illnesses. Osugo retired in 2019 after attaining retirement age. He is credited for steering major reforms in the prisons, which made it stable. Osugo was plucked from the National Police Service while serving as the Nairobi Provincial Criminal Investigation Officer in 2008 and named the Commissioner of prisons then. Osugo was a career police officer who had served various positions. He served as the Nairobi Central Divisional CID chief before he was promoted and transferred to Provincial CID chief in Eastern province. In 2005, he was transferred back to Nairobi in the same capacity where he served until his appointment as commissioner of prisons. Before his appointment by former president Mwai Kibaki, a section of prison wardens had rioted complaining of poor working environment. They among others complained they did not have uniforms and houses. Osugo came on board with his team and managed to transform the department to a modern institution. Many police officers and prisons officers have mourned his death, describing him as a humble and devoted officer who transformed many.
