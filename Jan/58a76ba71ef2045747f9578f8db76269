The government has condemned the Sunday’s storming of Brazil’s presidential palace and Supreme Court by former president Jair Bolsonaro supporters. Foreign affairs principal secretary Korir Sing’oei said such actions aimed at reversing the will of the people ought to be rejected. “Any use of force designed at reversing democratic electoral outcomes anywhere in the world must be repudiated,” said Sing’oei. The Sunday incident was a culmination of online conspiracies which had been circulating for weeks pushing the idea that the election in Brazil was rigged and that Bolsonaro was the real winner. The police have since regained control of the buildings in the capital Brasilia after hours of clashes. His statement comes as other leaders from across the world join in to also denounce the attacks. US President Joe Biden has termed the situation as “outrageous”. “I condemn the assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil. Brazil’s democratic institutions have our full support and the will of the Brazilian people must not be undermined,” Biden said on Twitter. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has already vowed to punish supporters of the ousted far-right leader who also stormed Congress. Brasilia's Civil Police said that 300 people have been arrested. Bolsonaro flew out of Brazil on the eve of Lula’s inauguration and is currently in Florida. Prime cabinet secretary Musali Mudavadi represented Kenya during the inauguration ceremony in Brazil. Chile’s Gabriel Boric called the storming of the critical institutions a “cowardly and vile attack on democracy”.
