She expressed her disappointment at how her ex Jamal behaved when he learned she was pregnant for him. The mother of one says that after that is when he introduced his now ex-wife Amira. "I even got pregnant for the guy and after that is when things came to light. He post his wife and kids and I questioned it because he was allegedly going through a divorce. I prefer it went down that way. I do not think I have the strength to be a single mother. We couldn't be together, it was wrong from the word go." What caused the miscarriage? "I was stressed and I was going through a lot."
