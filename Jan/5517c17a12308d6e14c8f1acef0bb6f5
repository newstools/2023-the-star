A city lawyer was on Tuesday morning arrested over forgery. The lawyer is accused of faking the official stamp and signature of an Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission advocate, which he used on his court documents. He went on to use the documents to fraudulently get Court orders against the anti-graft Commission. EACC said the suspected has been detained and will be arraigned in court. "The suspect is currently in custody at EACC Integrity Centre Police Station. He will be processed and presented before Milimani Anti-Corruption Court to face various criminal charges," a statement from EACC stated.
