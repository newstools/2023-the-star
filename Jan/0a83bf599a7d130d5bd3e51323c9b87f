Chief Justice Martha Kome on Monday met with the Danish Ambassador to Kenya Ole Thonke and the Ambassador of Sweden Caroline Caroline Vicini. The trio met to discuss strategic partnerships supported through the International Development Law Organisation which is led by the Kenya Country Manager Teresa Mugadza. Koome said that a key priority area of collaboration is rolling out SGBV courts across the country, with a special focus on establishing trauma-informed courtrooms and training Judicial Officers on SGBV-sensitive handling of cases. "To ensure that we resolve commercial disputes efficiently we hope to establish Small Claims Courts in urban areas and border towns. We target to establish 100 such courts in the next five years," Koome said. She added that the Judiciary is keen on embracing green justice especially green energy initiatives and being a regional leader in green jurisprudence.
