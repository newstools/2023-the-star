Cabinet and Principal secretaries were notably absent during President William Ruto's church function in Laikipia on Sunday. Ruto was attending an interdenominational church service at the Nanyuki stadium. He has also been holding a Cabinet retreat at the Mount Kenya Safari Club. During the service, Ruto was accompanied by his deputy Rigathi Gachagua and Prime Cabinet secretary Musalia Mudavadi. However, Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro said the members of the executive had been assigned tasks by the President and could not attend the service. "The reason we do not have Cabinet Secretaries and their PSs here is because they have unfinished business," he said. Nyoro further dismissed a belief held by some quarters that the retreat was meant to be an excursion, saying it was not the case. Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru voiced similar sentiments saying she found the CSs in groups developing work plans. "Jana usiku tukienda kulala baada ya mikutano, tuliwaacha kwa boardrooms," she said. This loosely translates to," After we retired last night, we left them in boardrooms." Gachagua had on Saturday night posted photos in the company of Ruto and Mudavadi emerging out of the meeting at the hotel.
