COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli on Thursday described the late Prof George Magoha as a man who was resolute in his decisions. Atwoli who was addressing the press at Magoha's residence in Nairobi reminisced a day when his son was dismissed from the University of Nairobi. Magoha, he said, was then serving as the varsity's vice chancellor. "He was a serious man and indeed very serious because he called me one day and told me I don't want your son in my university anymore," said Atwoli who had visited to condole with the family. The SG explained that not even his influence or negotiation tactics saved him from trouble. He did not, however, give reasons as to why his son was being sent away. "He told me, Francis I have said no and my no is no, take your son to another university in the country," Atwoli said adding that not even their friends would make change his stance. The official further termed the late CS as an incorrupt and outright person. He said Magoha would be buried without even a shilling stolen from anyone. "We, in the World of work know who is corrupt and who is not because we are represented everywhere," he said. He added, "Nobody will come here and say I bribed him to do for me this and that.
