The long wait is over for 25 coaches after they received their CAF B license after a year. Their course was disrupted by Kenya’s suspension by Fifa last year but they finally sat their exams and completed their CAF B training. The class included former Starlets player and assistant coach Jacqueline Juma, former Harambee Stars striker George Midenyo, Kariobangi Sharks head coach William Muluya, former Harambee Stars captain Stephen Ocholla, and Bidco Assistant Simon Wagema. Others are Abdinasser Kassim of Good Hope Soccer Academy, George Ouma of the M-Pesa Foundation Academy, Nasoro Mwakoba of Kenya Navy FC, and Pascal Ochieng of Posta Rangers among others. Speaking during the closing ceremony, Abdulrahman Ali expressed his gratitude to FKF and CAF for the opportunity. “I thank the federation and Caf for giving us this chance to do and get our CAF B license. I am 25 years old and I have gotten my CAF B. It’s an incredible feeling,” said Ali. He added: “To all young coaches, I urge you to participate in these classes and come and help build the game.” Hagai Otieno, a CBC teacher from Mombasa urged schools to sponsor teachers for coaching courses so that children are handled properly. This is the second CAF B class in the country bringing the number of coaches at that level to 50. They are now one course away from the pinnacle of CAF coaching qualifications -the CAF A license.
