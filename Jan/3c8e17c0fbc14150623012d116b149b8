Junior golfer Cynthia Chelogoi carded 39 stableford points to win the inaugural Rupa tournament at the nine-hole Eldoret Golf Club over the weekend. The daughter of professional golfer, Andrew Chelogoi, managed 18 and 21 points in each nine to secure the crown in a tournament that attracted 96 players. The 21-year-old bogeyed several holes in the opening nine but in the back nine she doubled her effort and produced an impressive 21 points. “The weather was good for me and the tournament organisers made it possible for the smooth running of the event. However, I have been practicing on the range the whole week which has contributed to my good performance," said Cynthia. She said her father had inspired and motivated her ahead of the tournament. “After winning at the junior level, my dad told me that I can do well (in the main tournament). With his words of encouragement, I have done exactly that. I wanted to play my best golf just as he plays and that was well executed,” she said after beating her elder brother Danny Chelogoi. Cynthia, who sat her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) last year, said her foursome was fantastic. "This was a great day because I played with great people. I wanted to play well and my flightmates, Ahmed Ferej, Gracemary Karira and Rosemary Cuthbert, motivated me," she added. Handicap 15 J.K Serem was the runners-up with 38 points followed by Paul Mwangi (37), ahead of Ken Serem and Shashvat Patel on count-back as Jonah Kosgei closed the top six places with 36 points. Alex Tolgos and Adarsh Shah won nearest to the pin titles. The first nine and second nine was won by Parit sanghrajka and Felix Tarus on 20 and 21 points respectively.
