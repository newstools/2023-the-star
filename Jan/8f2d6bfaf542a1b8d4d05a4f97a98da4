President William Ruto on Friday evening held a meeting with Kisumu governor Anyang' Nyong'o and Migori Governor Ochilo Ayacko ahead of the Kisumu tour. In a statement, Ruto thanked Nyanza leaders for choosing to work with the national government. "We thank Governor Ochilo Ayacko and other leaders for choosing to work with the national government to advance these crucial sectors. This is the spirit of devolution," Ruto said. He said that fishing, infrastructure, mining and agriculture are essential elements of empowerment for Migori, it's economy and the people. Ruto also met Nyong'o and the Kisumu county administration at Kisumu State Lodge. Ruto said that they had a discussion on the development of the port. "We are committed to exploiting the full potential of the Kisumu Port that stands to change the economic fortunes of the East African region," Ruto said. The President is traversing the Nyanza region to launch development projects. On Friday, Ruto landed in Homa Bay where he was received by governor Gladys Wanga and other leaders. Wanga said they raised issues with the president on the introduction of ferry services in Lake Victoria, a revival of a fish processing plant, and an upgrade of the county referral hospital from level four to level five. She proposed the upgrade of Mawego Technical Training Institute to a national level as well as the expansion of Tom Mboya University. "Homa Bay has great potential to attract a lot of tourists. We appeal for the government to upgrade Kabunde Airstrip to accommodate more flights," Wanga said.
