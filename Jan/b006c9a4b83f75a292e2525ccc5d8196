Greece's last King Constantine II has died aged 82, his doctors say. He passed away in an intensive care unit in a private hospital in Athens late on Tuesday, the Associated Press reports citing hospital staff. Constantine II ascended to the throne in 1964 during a turbulent period in Greek history that culminated in a military coup three years later. He was soon forced to flee abroad following an unsuccessful counter-coup. The monarchy was abolished in 1973. Constantine II was later stripped of his Greek citizenship. He was married to Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark. The couple had five children. In 2002, he and other family members received compensation for their former property in the country. A keen sailor, Constantine II won gold in a team event at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. He also later served on the International Olympic Committee.
