Zetech University Sparks have acquired the Sports Personality of the Year (SOYA) most promising girl, Medina Okot from Kenya Ports Authority, according to coach Maurice Obilo. The tactician disclosed yesterday that everything has been sorted out and Okot will be in action this weekend during a league clash against Equity Bank Hawks. "Medina is officially a Zetech player now. This is a big boost for the team since the young player is currently the top centre for the national team. "The towering 6'5" post player on Friday beat Faith Cherotich (athletics) and Rachel Achieng (weightlifting) to bag the  Most Promising girls' award during the Soya awards at the KICC. Obilo is convinced that the varsity side, which provided five players to the national women's provisional team, will improve on last year's third-place finish in the league. "With her in the team, we will definitely compete for the national title. She strengthens our chances and we will give it a good push," said Obilo. Okot, who is also a member of the Kenya 3x3 side, has been a key member of national champions KPA. "The international experience she brings to the team is huge," said Obilo. He said Okot has already reported for her classes which remain the institution's main priority and this makes him happy as her coach. "Obilo encouraged fellow coaches to allow players to move when education and job opportunities come their way. Okot joined the team at a time the students also lost national team playmaker Debbie Obunga to the bankers. "Whether they are our key players or not, let us not stop their progress when they get learning or work prospects," he said. He went on, "Rather than playing for us, let's make it a priority to look at the future of our players." Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF ) competition secretary Joseph Amoko confirmed guard Hilda "Dante" Ndegwa as the other player who had moved from Hawks to KPA.
