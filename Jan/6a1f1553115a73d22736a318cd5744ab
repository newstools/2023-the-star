Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua was on Sunday morning joined by Kiambu and Nyandarua senators on his day three Mt Kenya trek. For the third time, the DP was joined by Karungo Thang'wa of Kiambu and Methu Muhia of Nyandarua to trek up the mountain. "They say the third time is a charm. Another morning, another chance to connect with nature. Another chance for introspection. Another chance to centre myself in appreciation of the task ahead of us in nation building," he said. Gachagua said the three had a discussion about the expectations of Kenyans on Kenya Kwanza administration. "We spoke at length about the expectations that Kenyans from all walks of life have put on us as their elected leaders," he said. He added that President William Ruto's administration will deliver on its promises to Kenya, by mentoring youthful leaders. "As the sun rises every morning behind Mt Kenyaâ€™s Batian Peak, sets at the end of the day, the President administration's will deliver on its promises to Kenya. We can only do this by mentoring our youthful leaders who share the same passion and zeal," he said
