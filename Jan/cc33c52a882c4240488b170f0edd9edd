The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has condemned the chaos witnessed at the Kericho County Assembly on Friday. The commission said it is investigating the issue. "Pursuant to its mandate under Chapter Six of the Constitution, the Commission condemns the chaos witnessed in Kericho County Assembly and will conduct investigations on the same in accordance with the applicable laws," it said. The wrangles, including fistfights and throwing off a chair, ensued during a special sitting to decide the House leadership, for the fourth time since the August 9, 2022 elections. EACC pointed out that such conduct by state officers was an embarrassment to the nation. "No differences of whatever nature or magnitude should make MCAs or any other State Officers engage in physical fights or other unethical conduct," EACC said. The integrity body added that the actions took the country back to a challenge that many county assemblies have managed to overcome, over the years. County assemblies, it added, should avoid using "unorthodox" means when resolving differences. Notably, the commission said, the actions of the concerned Kericho MCAs fall outside the prescribed ethics and integrity standards for state officers, as laid out under chapter six of the Constitution. Article 73(1)(a) of the Constitution requires state officers to conduct themselves in a manner that shows respect for the people, promotes public confidence and brings honour to the nation and dignity to the office. Under Article 75(1(c), a state officer is required to behave, whether in public and official life, in private life, or in association with other persons, in a manner that does not demean the office they hold.
