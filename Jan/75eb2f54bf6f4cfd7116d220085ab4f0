Evangelist Reuben Kigame has said the current dialogue on alcohol consumption is not a Mt Kenya issue. This is after Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua ordered a crackdown on 24hr clubs in the Mt Kenya region. In a statement on Friday, Kigame said that the country needs to use reason and less emotion on the question of alcoholism. "The current dialogue on alcohol in Kenya is not just a Mount Kenya issue. I come from Vihiga and lament that by 8 am a lot of young people are already drunk so even if I got them a job, they cannot do it. we need rehabilitation and national dialogue," he said. Kigame said that by taxing alcohol heavily, the country encourages the proliferation of illicit dangerous brews. He said that the social and economic challenges in Kenya have led people to run to alcohol to cope. "The solution to drunkenness is dealing with mental stress, by investing more in mental wellness, lowering the standards of living and preaching the right sermons in our churches," he said. "We should restrict the hours the bars are open and where they are located. It should be made illegal to be found drinking during the day when you are supposed to be working." He said that all bars should close by 9 pm and people go to their families. "I have been a Christian for over 40 years and study the Bible closely, but I have never seen a condemnation of drinking alcohol. What is condemned is drunkenness or the abuse of alcohol. I don’t drink, but believe that what the Bible wants is control of the use of alcohol," Kigame added. He said the country needs compassion for those people struggling with alcoholism. He said that women and children should be in focus when discussing alcoholism because they bear the weight of parental absenteeism, education, food, housing, and health needs for the family.
