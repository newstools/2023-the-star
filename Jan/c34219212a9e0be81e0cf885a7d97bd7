Former World Under-20 3,000m steeplechase champion Amos Serem is optimistic the country will reclaim the water and barriers title at August's global show in Budapest after missing out on both the World Championships in Oregon, USA and Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. Serem, who is keen to represent the country at the World Championships in Hungary, said the country is fast losing grip on what used to be its preserve. Serem said he wants to be part of the battalion that will launch a campaign in Budapest to reclaim the lost glory. He said that losing the 3,000m steeplechase titles to Moroccan Soufiane El Bakkali at both the World Championships and Olympic Games was embarrassing. “We want to return the 3,000m steeplechase title back home after missing out on two important occasions,” said Serem, who was third at the Athletics Kenya (AK) Central Rift meeting held on Saturday at the Lobo Village. “This is the first race of the year and I want to ensure that 2023 is a successful one on track. I came here to run 2km in search of speed for the season ahead. I wanted to run well ahead of the World Championships in Budapest,” he said. Serem finished third in the 2km race in 5:25.0 during Athletics Kenya (AK) Central Rift meeting. Lukas Kiprop (5:18.0) won the race while  Vincent Koech (5:24.5) was second. Serem was subsequently named as a reserve runner in the Central Rift relays team ahead of the national championships set for Prisons Staff Training College, Ruiru next weekend. “I also want to focus on the Diamond League as part of my preparations for Budapest. I will also be competing at the AK track and field weekend meetings,” he said.
