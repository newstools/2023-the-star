A total of 5,000 athletes are expected at the third edition of Mount Kenya Meru Mountain Running Championship slated for February 26 at School of Adventure. Athletes will take part in the 2km race, 6km junior women, 8km junior men and 10km senior men and women. Kithinji Maragara, who took over from Joseph Kinyua as chairman of Meru Mountain Running said: "We expect a quality field during the championships. As the new office, we will double our efforts to ensure that the event is a success." "The prize money remains the same. Kinyua and team did a great job. The ball is now on our court," added Maragara, who doubles up as the Athletics Kenya Eastern Region chairman. The inaugural edition of the championships was rolled out in February 2020. However, the event didn't take place in 2021 because of the Covid 19 pandemic but happened last year same month. Outgoing chairman Kinyua said in a statement: "We wish the event continues into the future in view of the impact it can make on the county of Meru and Kenya at large. In this view therefore, we have handed over Sh2, 896,582 to the new team that will move the event forward. These assets are exclusively sourced from private enterprises and well wishers. The rallying call for the championships has been 'fighting cancer' which is prevalent in Meru. Towards this course, the outgoing management committee was able to release Sh1m in 2021 and Sh4m last year. Meru County Chief of Staff Nchamba Mbithi added: "Governor Kawira Mwangaza has pledged her support for the event. We would like to see the championship grow as part of growing sports in the region."
