President William Ruto has called on the East Africa Community member states to cooperate to eliminate trade barriers. Ruto said if the countries within the bloc united for a common front challenges hindering free trade would be abolished. “We have a common destiny as EAC. We must therefore work together towards eliminating impediments to trade and investment within the region for the prosperity of the people,” Ruto said. He spoke when he held talks with the EAC council of ministers chairman Ezechiel Nbigira and secretary general Peter Mathuki among other officials at Statehouse. The discussion also centred on strengthening a borderless region and investment opportunities. During his visit to Uganda last year October, Ruto said border restrictions were hampering free trade and movement of persons. He called on the Community to lead the way toward the realisation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). “It is our place as leaders and citizens of the EAC region for us to work together so that we can transform our borders which today stand out as barriers and convert them to bridges," he said at Kololo stadium in Kampala. "This will help goods, services and people to move across East Africa without any impedes."
