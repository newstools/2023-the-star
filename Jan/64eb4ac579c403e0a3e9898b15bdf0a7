Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has said the Kenya Kwanza administration is determined to restore hope in the country. In a New Year's message on January 1, Mudavadi said the government will deliver on its mandate in 2023, addressing the challenges the country is facing. He urged Kenyans to work hard to boost their living standards. "Work will bolster feeding our families and boost our economy," he said. He said 2022 had been tough, acknowledging the resilience of Kenyans through it all. "The year 2022 had its fair share of hits and misses in the lives of Kenyans," Mudavadi said. He said 2022, saw Kenya's economy "bleed", as it was the year that followed the Covid-19 pandemic. "However, the usual stoicism of Kenyans won. We overcame the terrible experience and peacefully ushered in a new government," he added. "Happy New 2023 Year. And God bless Kenya." President William Ruto had also said the government is committed to reviving the economy. Speaking at a prayer service to usher in the New year at State House, Mombasa, Ruto said the government will not shy away from making tough decisions aimed at sustainable economic growth. "We are focused on investing in areas that will drive our economy forward sustainably," he said. "I am confident that we have laid a foundation that will take our economy away from dependence on debt to dependence on revenue that is raised locally."
