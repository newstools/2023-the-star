Former Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho has revealed that during his days as a state official, ex-Ducation CS George Magoha wanted to quit. Speaking on Tuesday when he visited the family of Magoha at their Lavington home to pay his condolences, Kibicho said back then, Magoha felt like he was not needed. The former PS said Magoha, who worked at the Kenya National Examination Council then, decided to resign after a decision that the Council should take a temporary leave. "Around the weekend, Magoha had issued a gazette notice and the decision seemed to have changed and he felt he had been put under the bus,"Kibicho recalled. He further said Magoha called him to the Knec office in the morning saying he wanted to resign. "He said he wanted to resign because he felt he was no longer needed. How can he be put under the bus and turned into a laughing stock," Kibicho said. "He(Magoha) was serious. He had a letter of resignation." Kibicho said he, however, helped calm the situation and the two (he and Magoha), called Professor Stephen Kiama of UoN and they had small chat to resolve the matter. The Uhuru-era PS said he also took the opportunity to remind Magoha that the political arena required that one learns "how to dance with the devil," something Kibicho learned during his early days in civil service. Kibicho had accompanied retired President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Cabinet secretaries to visit the family of Magoha. Mama Margaret Kenyatta, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and CSs Eugene Wamalwa and Margaret Kobia were also present. Magoha died on January 24, leaving behind the legacy of having anÂ illustrious career in medicine, academia and public service.
