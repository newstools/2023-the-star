Vulva Vie is South Africa’s first intimate spa specialising in the vagina, feminine health and more. Monica van Vuuren, the founder of Vulva Vie, said the concept for South Africa’s first intimate spa was born about five years ago. She says the vision behind Vulva Vie is to give women a safe space where they can go to get educated and talk about personal problems down there that are not medical and can’t be answered by your gynaecologist.
