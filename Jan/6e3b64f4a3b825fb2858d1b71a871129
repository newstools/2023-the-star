Embu governor Cecily Mbarire has threatened to disclose details of tycoons he said are funding opposition chief Raila Odinga's planned rallies. The governor said a meeting was recently held in Mombasa where resources for the Monday's planned opposition rally were harnessed. "I know the people who held a meeting in Mombasa to plan on how to bankroll Raila," Mbarire said during a thanksgiving service in Kirinyaga. "I will soon name the people who are financing the opposition leader and, soon I will reveal their names." Mbarire was reacting to reports that Raila has planned a big political rally at Nairobi's Kamukunji to allegedly speak to a dossier on how the August 9 presidential polls were stolen. "Raila is now in late 70s, he is a grandfather and must now know what is expected of him at his old age," Mbarire said. The governor asked President William Ruto not to be threatened by the planned opposition rallies and instead focus on development.
