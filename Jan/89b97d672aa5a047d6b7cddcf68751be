Tanzanian singer Rose Muhando has described Guardian Angel as her favourite Kenyan gospel artiste. Speaking during a recent interview while in Kenya, Muhando was asked to speak about her favourite singers. She said a few of them and when asked to say who her best was, she pointed out Guardian Angel. "All their songs are good. Size 8 who I have a song with, Betty Bayo, Solomon Mukubwa and Guardian Angel," she said. Muhando added that she has known Guardian for a long time and that she would be glad to work with him. "I love Guardian Angel and the way he sings. His way of singing, there is that flavour he puts in his songs," she said. "I have known him since he was starting off in the industry, and we have been together in various events." On seeing the video, Guardian Angel responded, saying he was humbled, adding that he hoped this year they would work together. "2023 Mungu awezeshe." When Size 8 did a collabo with Muhando, she told Word Is the song was straight from their hearts to appreciate the gift of life after fighting different battles in life. "I've longed to do a collabo with the legendary artiste since I got saved seven years ago," she said. The mother of two added that they bonded quickly. "We did it so fast. The shortest time I've ever worked on any song with anyone. God's grace was too sufficient. She is so experienced."
