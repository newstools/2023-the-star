At least 210 College and University graduates from Kericho who had been locked out from employment opportunities due to lack of experience now have a reason to smile.2. This is after the county launched a one-year internship program that seeks to give a lifeline to the graduates to enable them to gain practical knowledge in their fields in various county departments. The program being rolled out by the County Public Service board is the first in the county. Governor Eric Mutai who spoke during the launch disclosed that 104-degree graduates, as well as 106 with diplomas, will benefit from the program. “The group will acquire hands-on training and skills acquisition to enhance their future employability,” he said. Public Service Management Executive Brenda Bill and the department's Chief Officer Betsy Chebet, indicated that the students will benefit from a stipend to be determined by County Public Service Board. “University and College who graduated within the last three years will be eligible for the program,” said Mutai. Besides impressive academic certificates, the program beneficiaries will only be required to have a certificate of good conduct. Mutai who doubles up as the Council of Governors (CoG)Education Committee Chairman at the same time announced that his administration will provide bursaries to 3,000 secondary school students comprising orphans and other eligible candidates from humble backgrounds. “This time around, the bursary will amount to Sh10,000 which more money than the amount the previous regime used to allocate as school fees for orphans and other vulnerable students,” he said. Mutai also disclosed that his administration will sponsor form four leavers who didn’t attain University or college entry grades to tertiary institutions. “The county requires masons, carpenters, and mechanics among other cadres of artisans. There is a good living to be made out of such careers. Kericho youths shouldn’t frown on such blue-collar jobs,” he said.
