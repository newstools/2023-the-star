A light moment was witnessed at the Nanyuki Stadium when Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua took to the stage to make his speech. He narrated how he was allegedly mistreated in the run-up to the August 9 polls. But even with the 'persistent mistreatment' the DP said God was on their side. "Sisi wenye tulitishwa tuko hapa, lakini Mungu hakuli ugali, tena halali Kayole, anakaa Mbiguni ametusimamia sasa tuko hapa, " he said amid cheers from congregants. This is loosely translated to: For those of us that were threatened, we are now here, God doesn't eat Ugali neither does He sleep in Kayole. Rigathi also described how during the campaign season, the people of Laikipia promised him that they will vote for William Ruto. "Nilipokuja hapa Laikipia, waliniambia mambo ya Ruto tumemaliza, wewe tuletee Jaguar atuimbie, atufurahishe," he said. This is loosely translated as: When I came to campaign here in Laikipia, the residents assured me that they'll vote for Ruto, and that I should bring Jaguar to sing and entertain them. Gachagua said his main mandate was to ensure people of Mt Kenya were with Ruto. "Mimi nililala kwa mlima, kazi ilikua nikufanya mambo iwe sawa," he said. This is loosely translated to: I used to sleep in the Mt Kenya region, my work was to ensure everything is ok. Jaguar, whose real name is Charles Kanyi is the former Starehe MP and lost in the August 9 general elections. He is also an artiste and has a wide range of songs, with a popular one dubbed Kigeugeu.
