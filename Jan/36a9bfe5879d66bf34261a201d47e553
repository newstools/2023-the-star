President William Ruto has called for cooperation between the Senate and the National Assembly to end the sibling rivalry between the two Houses. Speaking on Saturday at the ongoing CSs retreat at the Fairmont Mt Kenya Safari Club in Nanyuki, Ruto said he will not want to see the two Houses dragging each other to court. “We will find a framework that will deal with any disputes that arise between the Senate and National Assembly,” Ruto said. The Head of State regretted that public resources were being wasted in settling conflicts between public institutions. “Government entities should not take each other to court unnecessarily; they must endeavor to settle their issues out of court,” he said. Ruto noted that he will continue working with governors as per the dictates of the Constitution. “This is not by choice made by some leaders or political parties. As leaders, we must be driven by public interest,” the President said. Ruto said cabinet secretaries will be allowed to prosecute government agenda on the Floor of the House as part of the administration’s plan to make the oversight role of Parliament “real and effective.” Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua said national and county governments must also work closely to serve Kenyans effectively. “It is in our unity that we can effectively transform our country,” Gachagua  said. Council of Governors chairperson Anne Waiguru said there are no issues between the two levels of government. “We are focused on the implementation of development projects and the delivery of services to wananchi,” Waiguru said. Cabinet Secretaries, the Council of Governors, Principal Secretaries, House leadership, among other government officials were present at the retreat.
