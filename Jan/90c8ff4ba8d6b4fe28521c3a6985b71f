Strathmore University teams will be in Mombasa to face off against Kenya Ports Authority sides in the Kenya National Basketball League matches. The varsity sides are aware of the task that awaits them on Saturday at the Makande Welfare Hall, where the dockers remain unbeaten. In their other fixtures of the week, KPA will again welcome home Eldonets and Eldonet Platinum. KPA men's coach Sammy Kiki said this will be his charges' first game since taking on Kenyatta University's Pirates last November. "We are playing two tough matches this weekend, but we will be ready and will give a good account of ourselves," he offered. Blades' coach Tony Ochieng said he will make five to six changes to the team that lost to Ulinzi Warriors and Equity Bank over the weekend. "This will be our third tight game in a row. Our realistic target now is to finish in fourth place," noted Ochieng. Ladies coach Ronny Owino said his girls will miss three key players Alexander Juma, Edna Kola and Beryl Katete out with injuries. The other two, Sharon Ogaji and Cheryl Wanda are not available for the tie against unbeaten Port women. "It will be very tough. It is a tall order playing KPA who are unbeaten on home court." Noted Owino. Strathmore Team Two also have a date with Coastal Queens who are equally tough. However, Owino said they will give 100 percent. At the United States International University (USIU) courts, KU Pirates meet Kisumu Lakeside in the men's fixtures. There will be three women's matches on the card with Eagle Wings meeting Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) "Lynx". Storms face off against University of Nairobi Dynamites as Africa Nazarene University (ANU) Panthers play KU Oryx. Zetech University Titans confront Kisumu Lakeside and ANU square it off against UoN Terrorists in what should be a tight duel. Focus will be on former KPA centre Medina Okot who will put on Zetech University Sparks colours as they tackle Equity Bank Hawks.
