Athletics Kenya regions are gearing up for their respective cross country championships this weekend. The events will be used to select teams for the national cross country championships scheduled for January 21 at Kenya Prisons Staff Training College in Ruiru. AK wants all regions and affiliates to complete their championships by January 7. Most regions will hold their championships on Saturday but the Nyanza South event will be held on Monday, January 9 at Tendere Sports Ground, said chairman Peter Angwenyi. “We decided to move the event to Monday because this region is dominated by Adventists. We also want to give the athletes a day or two to prepare since we are just from the December holidays,” said Angwenyi. In Nyanza North, the championships will be held at Kisumu National Polytechnic. “We expect teams from Siaya, Homa Bay and Kisumu counties,” said regional chairman Joseph Ochieng. Ochieng also hinted that the first Athletics Kenya track and field weekend meeting on February 24 and 25 would be shifted from Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology to Moi Stadium in Kisumu. “However, this depends on the condition of Moi Stadium. The County of Kisumu is currently renovating the stadium ahead of Kicosca games but if it is not in good condition, we shall still hold the two-day event in Bondo as planned. We have already written a letter to the university.” Other AK affiliates will hold their championships on Friday and Saturday. On Friday, Kenya Defence Forces and National Police Service will hold their championships at Ulinzi Sports Complex and Ngong Race Course respectively. On Saturday, the Universities' cross country championships will be held at Kabarak University while National Youth Service and Kenya Wildlife Service will stage their events at Ngong Race Course and Lobo village respectively. Kenya has already selected a team for the World Cross Country Championships to be held in Bathurst, Australia on February 18.
