Mwamba coach Peter Kepha believes his young charges can finish in the top six in the Kenya Cup this season. Kepha's charges are currently placed fifth on the log with 14 points from five matches and the tactician is bullish about the side's prospects for the remainder of the season. “I have a very young team and so far, the season has been good. We have had three wins and our target remains to be in the top six as we are in transition with several young players,” observed Ndonji. The tactician said the likes of forwards Kevin Juma, Paul Opiyo, Collins Odhiambo and Gideon Mbithi who are playing in their second season, will only get better with time and make the club a force to reckon with in a season or two. “The crop of young players we have will get better. We expect the experienced players we have to mentor them and ensure they are at their peak in a year or two,” added Kepha.  He hailed the input of the former players of the club in providing resources. "We are a community-based club and it has been a daunting financial time in the past two seasons with very scarce resources. However,  with the support of the former players, we have been able to provide for the team,” said Kepha The side, known as Kulabu, opened the season with a 19-13 defeat to Homeboyz but bounced back to beat Nakuru 12-6 before registering a 19-10 win over Blak Blad and lost 24-23 to Catholic Monks. They edged Strathmore Leos 27-20 when the league resumed over the weekend. Kepha's  charges face a stern test this month with matches against KCB on Saturday and a week later, a trip to Nakuru to face last season's losing finalists Menengai Oilers "We are taking one match at a time. KCB is a good side and we know we will be tested accordingly. However,  I believe my boys will put up a good show and go all out and be competitive," he added.
