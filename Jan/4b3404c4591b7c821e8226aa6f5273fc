National Super League club, Fortune Sacco, have been dissolved. The club brought the development weeks after they spurned Football Kenya Federation’s invitation to participate in the country’s second-tier league. Fortune were yet to play any game this season due to a pending court case, involving promotion and relegation. Fortune Sacco Deputy Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Timothy Muthike said the team’s promotion to the top league resulted in a change in management structure as they installed new management to run the club. “When things changed, we felt there is no need to take part in the lower league as that was not our expectation. We’re no longer interested. The excitement of qualification is gone and we’ve moved on,” he said. “The players have been notified and they will be free to join he teams of their choice when the transfer window opens.” Muthike put an end to any hopes of a comeback by stating that they will most likely focus on sponsoring local leagues and other sports. “We had set aside Sh12 million for this season. The sponsor is unable to release the funds after failing to obtain promotion. We’re currently debating whether to support local leagues or other sports. We will not, however, be present.” Fortune Sacco were among the teams affected when the federation canceled last season’s leagues. Administration Police Bomet were also affected.
