Deputy President  Rigathi Gachagua has advised Administrative Police to refrain from political engagements. Speaking on Wednesday, the DP said that the APs should remember the oath they took. "If you want to engage in politics, just remove your uniform and give them at the gate. You can't serve two masters at the same time," Gachagua said. On a light note, Gachagua cautioned the APS  against joining politics, saying it is a difficult job. "Politics is very hard but if you want to join me, just resign first and handover your uniform," he said. The DP and his boss, President William Ruto have been urging the police to be non-partisan while discharging their duties. Ruto has been clear that police, regardless of which rank must serve all Kenyans fairly, irrespective of their political or ethnic affiliation. “We want the police to be professional, independent and accountable while protecting Kenyans,” he said. More than 5,000 police graduates have been released to service after a nine-month of training at various National Police Service training colleges. The recruits will be required to remain in the service for at least 10 years before leaving. A Sh1.2 million fine will be imposed on anyone who flouts the new rule. Officials said the amount would be commensurate with the investment made by the government on a recruit. The government has spent Sh5.7 billion in training personnel since March 2022. The service has in the past three years been losing about 2,000 officers yearly.
