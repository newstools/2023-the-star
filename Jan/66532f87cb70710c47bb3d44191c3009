Nominated Senator Karen NyamuÂ has been given more time by the UDA disciplinary committee to respond to allegations against her. She appeared before the committee on Friday where the sitting was later adjourned to February 24 at 9am. "The senator was allowed more time to respond to the allegations levelled against her by a party member,' the United Democratic party said in a notice. Charges against the senator revolve around her 'shameful' conduct on December 16, 2022 The lawmaker caused drama at Mugithi artiste Samidoh's concert in Dubai leading to a clash with his wife Edday Nderitu. In a video clip that went viral online, Nyamu was seen being restrained by the event's security detail during the concer. A separate clip showed Nyamu dancing on stage as Samidoh and Akorino singer Karangu Muraya entertained revelers moments before she was whisked away after an altercation. The senator later blamed her actions on alcohol, a habit she vowed to quit come January this year. A section of Kenyans called for her expulsion from the party and saying she had breached Chapter Six of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity. Former UDA presidential hopeful Japhnei Orina was among those who called on the party to commence the ejection process. Orina, a member of the UDA National Youth Congress, wrote a letter to President William Ruto calling for Nyamu's expulsion for unbecoming conduct. Should the disciplinary process result in Nyamu's expulsion from the party, she will automatically lose her senatorial post.
