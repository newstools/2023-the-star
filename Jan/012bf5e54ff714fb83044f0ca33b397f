The government will provide the necessary support to the family of late Prof George Magoha to ensure he gets a befitting send-off, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said. As part of the support, Gachagua announced that a Kenya Airforce helicopter will be availed to airlift the body from Nairobi to his Gem home in Siaya. The late Magoha is set to be buried next Saturday. “We will support the family in every way possible to ensure a befitting send-off for the former Education Cabinet Secretary,” Gachagua said. Assuring the family of the government’s readiness to facilitate the burial arrangements, Gachagua also stated any other logistical support including tents and food for the mourners will be provided. The DP made the remarks on Saturday when he led members of the Cabinet and senior government officials to condole with the family of Magoha at the Nairobi residence. To help in coordination and burial preparations, Gachagua said that ICT CS Eliud Owalo, Interior PS Raymond Omollo and the Chief of Staff at the Deputy President’s Office George McGoye would represent the government. He also conveyed President William Ruto’s condolences to the late CS family, describing him as a distinguished and dedicated public servant. Among those who accompanied are CS Eliud Owalo, Simon Chelugui (Cooperatives and SMEs) Florence Bore (Labour), Peninah Malonza (Tourism and Wildlife), Zacharia Njeru (Lands) and Rebecca Miano (EAC and ASALs). “We are ready to provide any other support the family might need from us,” he said.
