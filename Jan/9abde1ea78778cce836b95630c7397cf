Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has vowed to deal firmly with opposition chief Raila Odinga's planned rallies. The Azimio leader has called for a big rally in Kamukunji on Monday to speak about an alleged dossier detailing how the presidential election was stolen. "One of my duties is to defend the president.....Mr. President please allow me to deal with that man (Raila)....I am the real Mau Mau for him," Gachagua said. Gachagua said that Ruto's successful tour of Luo Nyanza should not be confused to mean willingness to have a handshake. "We know what you want so that we call you...we went to Nyanza and you think we can call you?" he posed. Gachagua, who spoke during a thanksgiving in Kirinyaga on Sunday, said Raila's brand of politics is well known since 1997. "We have seen from far what you(Raila) and that is what you have done all the years," he said. "You came destroyed the Moi government in 1997....in 2007 you came with nusu mkate.... in 2013 you tried and failed..... in 2017 you instilled fear in Uhuru and he called you for handshake and destroyed government," he said. The DP told the opposition leader that the Kenya Kwanza administration will not be ready for another handshake. "I am the real Mau Mau for Raila...give us a week or so we deal with them and then comeback to work for the coffee and tea for our farmers," he said.
