Kakamega Governor Fernandes Barasa has urged farmers in the western region to plant sugarcane in a bid to support the Mumias Sugar factory. Barasa, speaking on Tuesday in Kakamega, said the move will help sustain the sugar company. "And the thing I'd like to address here is the Mumias Sugar Company. I would like our farmers to please plant sugarcane so that our Company Mumias sugar can be sustained," Barasa said. The governor added that there is no way the company can operate without the farmers planting sugarcane. He noted that he is one of the large-scale farmers in the county and urged other farmers to plant sugarcane as well for the sake of the sugar company. "As Governor I am one of the largest farmers here in Kakamega. So, I would like our people in Mumias and Kakamega, in general, to please plant sugarcane to strengthen our Mumias sugar company, "Barasa said. Kakamega deputy governor Ayub Savula also came out on Saturday urging residents to resume sugarcane farming to sustain the Sugar Company. The majority of the farmers in the region had uprooted the crop from their farms following the Company's closure.
