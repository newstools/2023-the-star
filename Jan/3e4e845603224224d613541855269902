Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has urged Administration Police to live by the oath they have taken following the passing out. Speaking during the passing out parade of the Administration Police in Embakasi, Rigathi told the graduates to remain dedicated to their work, and serve the people. "Live by the oath you have taken, and do what you are supposed to do," he said. "Rais akona jeshi lake la siasa ambaye mimi ndiye kamanda wa hilo jeshi, hatuwahitaji kwa hilo jeshi, nyinyi ni leshi la Inspector General, mfanye kazi ya kulinda wakenya, na maisha yao." (President William Ruto has his political soldiers, and I am the leader, we don't need you in the political space, you belong to the IG, do your work, and protect the people and their lives). "Political space is a difficult place, please just stay where you are," he added. Rigathi said he was on the same ground as a graduate 32 years ago and was feeling nostalgic. "My presence is a nostalgic one, 32 years ago I was in this parade ground, during our time the training was professional and vigorous, and the standards have even gone higher," he said
