Nacada chief executive Victor Okioma has said that the western region is the leading producer of the illegal brew in the country. Speaking in Bungoma at Kanduyi ACC's office on Tuesday, Okioma called upon the National Government Administrative Officers to speed up the crackdown on the illegal brew. At least 11,020 litres of illegal brew, were destroyed in Kanduyi during the Tuesday crackdown. Okioma noted that previously the Central region was leading but now  Western has taken over followed by Nyanza. “We want to know about the people who make the illegal brew in our villages, even the President has announced a fight against it,” Okioma said. “I’m here to implement it and ensure that the President’s order is followed." The CEO noted that Nacada has organised awareness meetings across the country to fight illicit brew and substance abuse. “I have scheduled to move around the entire country together with regional commissioners to address chiefs and locals on the effects of illegal brew,” he said. He also ordered the closure of nightclubs operating in Bungoma without licences. “Please area DCC’s and chiefs let us liaise with the relevant authorities to ensure that bars are operating within the stipulated laws,” Okioma said. Speaking at the same function, Western regional commissioner, Isaac Nakoru said he is dedicated to fighting the production of illegal brew in the country. “It seems like Bungoma has more bars than schools, I want to announce a tough crackdown on those bars that are operating illegally,” Nakoru said. He said that there is high production of chang’aa, Busaa and kangara in the region.
