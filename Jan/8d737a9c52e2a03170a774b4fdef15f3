The High Court has allowed an application by businessman Hassan Mohamed Adan to amend his application and include 16 more polling stations for scrutiny in the contested Wajir gubernatorial case. Adan is challenging the win of Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi. He had initially listed 27 stations for scrutiny and recount of ballot papers and Kiems kit. He inadvertently failed to include the 16 stations which he claims there were grave electrical irregularities. The governor opposed the application saying it is incompetent, defective and time-barred. But Justice George Dulu in his ruling said the court has jurisdiction to deal with the application for scrutiny. On whether it's time-barred, the Judge said the application was made before the closure of evidence by witnesses. "Since the law provides that an application for scrutiny can be made at any time before judgement, then it can be made anytime before judgment," said the judge. He said there will be no prejudice as parties will have time to submit on the stations being sought for scrutiny.
