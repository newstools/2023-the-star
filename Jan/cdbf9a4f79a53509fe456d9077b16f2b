President William Ruto will on Tuesday meet with chairpersons of the constitutional commissions and holders of independent offices. State House press secretary Emmanuel Talam confirmed to the Star that the meeting will take place at 11am in State House. “The President has been straight forward on giving his support to independent bodies. He wants to assure them that his administration will not interfere with their mandates,” Talam said. He said Ruto acknowledges that since their establishment under the Constitution of Kenya in 2010, the constitutional commissions and independent offices are key pillars of sovereignty and democracy. Some of the commissions include ; Kenya National Human Rights Commission, National Land Commission, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, Parliamentary Service Commission, Judicial Service Commission and Commission on Revenue Allocation. Others are Public Service Commission, Salaries and Remuneration Commission, Teachers Service Commission, National Police Service Commission and Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission. Since his presidential win, Ruto vowed to support the commissions and let them work independently. He also urged them not to get engaged in partisan politics. Ruto said independent institutions like the police service and the Judiciary should not take instructions from political players. The Head of State pledged that his government will invest heavily in such institutions, to ensure they have resources to execute their mandates professionally and in accordance with the Constitution.
