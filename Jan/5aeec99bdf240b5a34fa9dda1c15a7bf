WhatsApp, the Meta-owned messaging app will roll out a new feature update that will allow users to post voice notes on their status. The update feature will bring the WhatsApp version up to 2.23.2.8. Users will be able to post a voice note for up to 30 seconds on their status updates. WABetaInfo said the feature is under development so it is not ready to be released to beta users. The microphone symbol will appear when you don't input any text in the image below. According to the report, Voice Status Note Updates, also known as "Voice Status," will let users record audio notes and post them on their Status tab, much like sending audio messages to other WhatsApp users in the chat window. Users would be able to update their status using sound cues in addition to the current options, which include images, videos, text updates, GIFs, and emoticons.
