Several politicians have bashed the Kenya Kwanza government over the just-released KCSE results. On Saturday, Former Mukurweini MP Kabando wa Kabando claimed that the 2022 KCSE results should be disbanded. On Friday, Education Cabinet Secretary Ezekiel Machogu said there were no irregularities in the 2022 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Examination. Machogu said the KCSE 2022 administration was clean and that the Ministry of Education devised various mechanisms to curb cheating. "We did come up with a mechanism that accountability was transferred to the personal level," The centre manager will be personally accountable for any irregularities. We designed a form for security personnel to sign how things went,” he said. However, the former MP said the statistics released by CS Machogu on a particular region was not adding up. “Total disgrace! Many schools' curves in the region statistically don't add up,” Kabando said. Going further, Kabando also called for the disbandment of the Kenya National Examinations Council and an audit should be carried out. “In lieu, KNEC should be disbanded, kila mtu aende kwao!" he said. East African Legislative Assembly Member of Parliament Kanini Kega also claimed that the results were a major scam. Azimio spokesperson Makau Mutua challenged the government to cancel the results and order a re-do of the exams.
