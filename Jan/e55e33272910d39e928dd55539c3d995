The just concluded by-election in Kandara constituency has caused divisions among UDA leaders in Murang’a county. Some MPs have hit out at Water Cabinet Secretary Alice Wahome for allegedly failing to support the party’s candidate Chege Njuguna. Chege won after garnering 21,650 votes, with Njau coming in second with 14,678 votes while Usawa Kwa Wote party’s Kibiru PMG Junior was third with 1,469 votes. According to Woman Rep Betty Maina, Wahome’s bitterness with Chege stemmed from his bid to vie for the seat against her in last year’s general elections. Chege came second then. Maina claimed that Wahome has been carrying the bitterness which prompted her to support another candidate during the primaries on November 26. However, her preferred candidate, Injinia Mwaura, came third in the nominations and backed off the race and Wahome transferred her support to another candidate, Titus Njau. Njau was second in UDA nominations and decamped to Ford Asili party. The MP accused the CS of making attempts to ‘spoil the ground’ for the UDA candidate despite being a member of the party. “She could not even pick up our phones or talk to us. She was full of hatred and her supporters have been talking trash about us…because she thought her personal interests were greater than the interests of the party," she said. “I want to humbly ask her to concentrate on her role as the Water Cabinet Secretary. Let her stop the jealousy and the ‘spirit of Cain." Her sentiments were echoed by Maragua MP Mary Waithera (Wamaua) who underscored the need for CSs to stop meddling in local politics and focus on working for the government. Nominated Senator and UDA party’s secretary general Veronica Maina urged members to work in unity and avoid divisions. “If we don’t build out party based on unity and cooperation, we will not get to where we are going,” she said.
