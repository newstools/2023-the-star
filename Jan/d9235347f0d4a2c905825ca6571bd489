The National Cohesion and integration commission has come out urging Kenyan leaders to refrain from actions and rhetoric that could lead to violence. The Commission Chairperson Samuel Kobia said they are committed to ensuring that the country remains united, peaceful and cohesive beyond elections. "We are calling upon all leaders to stop actions and rhetoric that can trigger violence," Kobia said. He said that if unchecked, violence in one place can still be repeated in another and before long, the whole country will burn. The commission chair said that the political development in the country in the last few days is creating unnecessary tension that if not managed can plunge the country into chaos. Kobia gave a case in point of the utterances by Korogocho MP Absalom Odhiambo at the Azimio la Umoja rally at Kamukunji grounds. Kobia claimed utterances by the MP invoked ethnic hatred while inciting Kenyans to violence. "We have summoned Absalom Odhiambo to record a statement," Kobia said. Kobia said that the 2022 general elections were the most peaceful, adding that even Kenyans agree so. "Indeed, Kenyans accepted the results and have moved on with their day-to-day activities," Kobia said. He said that the signing of the Political Decency and Accountability Charter by the four presidential candidates largely contributed to a peaceful election process. Kobia said that Kenyans ought to remember that the Head of State is a symbol of national unity. "Any actions that undermine the presidency will not only damage national cohesion but will also injure peace and unity among Kenyans." Kobia said the President ought to be accorded respect and honour by all and at all times.
