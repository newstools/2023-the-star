The Nubian Community in the Kibos area within Kisumu county has appealed to President William Ruto to come to their aid so that they can get title deeds for the land where they are. The community members stated that they have been living on the same parcel of land for the last 35 years. They said their forefathers also lived there during the pre-colonial period before Kenya got independence. Led by their representative Sheikh Musa Ismael, they noted that despite this, they have met various tribulations including an incident that saw their homes demolished, including the mosque and property, destroyed two years ago. Over 3500 people were two years ago affected by the demolitions of their homes by the Kenya Railways who had embarked on a mission to claim their grabbed land across the country. However, the court ruled in their favour and the community members were finally told to go back to their land, where they rebuilt their homes afresh. "What happened to us was unfortunate, we lost our loved ones due to the shock, and pressure because of the demolitions that were done to us." They stated that having title deeds for the land will prevent them from such reoccurrence. "We want to appeal to the President to come to our aid and help us out in acquiring the title deed for this land where we are," noted Ismael. Halifa Hamisi noted that despite having been living in Kibos for all those years, they are still a minority within the county. "I was born here, and my family is also here, but we are living like squatters, so Mr President kindly listen to our cry and come to pursue a rescue, " he said. He added that since the court allowed them back to the land after evictions and demolitions, they only need the title deed to ensure that such is not repeated.
