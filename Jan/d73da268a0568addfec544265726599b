Tens of female teachers were allegedly denied employment by TSC in Nandi on the basis of their counties of birth. The teachers had applied for employment in Nandi. Despite producing their marriage certificates as evidence of marriage in the county, TSC officials allegedly declined to give them jobs. Those who spoke to the Star said they were told that only local unemployed teachers were being given priority. The female teachers who were accompanied by their spouses protested saying the issue of "local teachers" was not part of TSC requirements and that they were unfairly denied employment. They were Speaking to The Star in Kapsabet on Friday, moments after the conclusion of the employment of 35,000 teachers countrywide. "TSC seems to be promoting localization of marriages instead of using it for national integration," a female teacher charged. The teachers hail from various counties among them Baringo, Trans-Nzoia, Bungoma, Uasin-Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kericho, Bomet, Nakuru and Laikipia among others. They want TSC to apologize to them and hand them employment letters since they met all the requirements criteria. Contacted for comment, Chesumei sub-county TSC director Kennedy Mekenye denied the claims saying he was not aware of such. "I had personally invited them for interviews, for now, I'm not aware of anyone rejected on the basis of marriage," Mekenye told the Star on phone. The majority of those rejected were from the Chesumei sub-county with spouses protesting over discrimination.
