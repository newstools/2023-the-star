Former Communications Authority Director General Francis Wangusi is appealing to the public for blood donation. Friends Church Quakers senior pastor Walter Bulimu in a memo to church members has called on those willing to donate to do so at the Nairobi Hospital where Wangusi is receiving treatment. "This is a kind appeal for blood donation for one of us Mr Francis Wangusi….who is admitted at Nairobi Hospital with low blood levels…” the memo said. “Willing donors can visit the blood donation unit at Nairobi Hospital and register their donation for Francis Wamukota Wangusi LMF ward Rm 14,” Bulimu added. This comes even as the government through the Kenya Tissue and Transplant Authority intensified its donation drives across the country to reduce the shortage gap. According to the World Health Organisation, blood transfusion saves lives and improves health, but many patients requiring transfusion do not have timely access to safe blood. The global health agency notes that providing safe and adequate blood should be an integral part of every country’s national health care policy and infrastructure. WHO recommends that all activities related to blood collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution be coordinated at the national level through effective organization and integrated blood supply networks. “An adequate and reliable supply of safe blood can be assured by a stable base of regular, voluntary, unpaid blood donors,” WHO says. The availability of safe blood and blood products is a prerequisite for various health care services. The country requires between 500,000 to one million units of blood a year. These include surgeries, treatments for cancer and other acute and chronic medical conditions, trauma care, organ transplantation, and childbirth: all lifesaving procedures.
