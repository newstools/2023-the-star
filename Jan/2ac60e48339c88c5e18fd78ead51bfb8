Alvin 'Buffa' Otieno and Brian Tanga have been recalled to the Kenya Sevens squad for the Hamilton and Sydney legs later this month. Otieno surprisingly withdrew from the programme in September last year on the eve of the Rugby Sevens World Cup in Cape Town to pursue a professional stint in Canada but things did not work out for him. On his part, Tanga last played for the Sevens team in 2019 and makes a welcome return to the squad following a three-year absence. Commenting on their inclusion, Kenya Sevens head coach Damian McGrath said the return of the duo will be key with Shujaa sitting in 14th place and keen to avoid relegation. “It's good to have the experience of Alvin and Tanga back in the squad.  Alvin is arguably one of the best Sevens players in his position while both are a little short of Sevens fitness. They bring a lot of experience and a little bit of an x-factor which is a welcome idea,” he added. Mwamba's Billy Odhiambo misses out on selection due to concussion but the tactician is hopeful that should he pass the protocols, he should be available for the Los Angeles and Vancouver tournaments in February. The tournaments will see debuts for Menengai Oilers'  John Okoth and Daystar Falcons youngster Floyd Wabwire. Shujaa are in tough Pool A for the Hamilton Sevens, where they face Samoa Fiji and France.
