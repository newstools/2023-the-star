Media personality Betty Kyallo has shut down rumours that her steamy video has leaked. This was after a video of her kissing a mysterious man emerged. Taking to her socials, Kyallo shared a clip of herself singing along to 'Sorry Not Sorry' song by DJ Khaled featuring Jay Z. She also shared a Tik Tok talking about peace and how much one would be willing to go to protect the same. "I am not dealing with nobody or nothing that will cost me my peace. My peace in number one priority, and I'm gonna protect my peace at all costs." Betty added that the reason she took long to jump into her recent relationship is that she was warned against rushing things.
