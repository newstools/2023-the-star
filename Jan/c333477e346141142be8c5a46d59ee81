Siaya Governor James Orengo has launched Sh75 million bursary scheme in honour of the late former Education Cabinet Secretary Professor George Magoha. The governor said Magoha deserves honour because he served diligently in all capacities. "We launch this bursary scheme in honour and appreciation of a great son of Siaya," Orengo said during the bursary launch. Ahead of the bursary launch, Orengo led the congregation in observing a minute of silence in honour of Magoha. He mourned Prof Magoha as an excellent scientist, teacher, and archetypically nice guy to people. He called on his compatriots to emulate Magoha and work hard in any job that their hands may find to do. The governor called on ward administrators and all that are involved in selecting beneficiaries of the bursary to do so transparently and with integrity. Orengo promised to visit all wards to ascertain that only needy students benefit from the scheme. He promised to increase the bursary budget in the next financial year to ensure that more needy students are accommodated. Up to 10,000 students are currently set to benefit from the county education bursary. Orengo said most needy students are in local day schools and Technical and Vocational Education Training Centers and polytechnics. "The Siaya county government of Siaya will focus more on such institutions," he said.
