Diamond Platnumz is advising men to be ready as women could dump them anytime. The WCB boss shared a reel from a popular social commentator called Alphadogmillionaire. He captioned the video: "Young boys, a little lesson for you," adding a peace emoji. In the video, the man tells his followers that they shouldÂ always prepare for women to leave them. "I don't care how much money or clout or status you have, you must prepare for that day she leaves you," he said. "One of the realest things I've heard is that she's not your girl, it's just your turn. You must understand that women are controlled by their emotions." All of Diamond's baby mamas have dumped him. He is currently alleged to be dating his signee Zuchu.
