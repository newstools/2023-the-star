Most schools posted unusual mean scores in KCSE results released even as CS Ezekiel Machogu insisted there was no cheating. It is not normal for schools to post an improvement of more than one point but some schools recorded a deviation of even four in their mean score. For instance, Mobamba High School improved by 4.1 to post a mean score of 9.2 in the 2022 exam. Last year, the school posted a mean score of 5.1. Machogu, however, said the 2022 KCSE administration and marking process was clean. "We did come up with a mechanism that accountability was transferred to the personal level," Machogu said. The CS said the ministry devised various mechanisms to curb cheating. "We said the centre manager will be personally accountable for any irregularities. We designed a form for security personnel to sign how things went,"hesaid. However, the Star analysis raised questions about the deviations acquired by a number of schools in the results.
