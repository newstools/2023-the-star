Murang'a Governor Irungu Kang'ata on Saturday urged President William Ruto to embrace people from Luo Nyanza in his government. Kang'ata observed that the people of Nyanza have in the past been sidelined in terms of development and it is time they are included in governance if Kenya is to prosper. "Being born in Luo Nyanza should never be a disadvantage. The blood that runs in me as a Kikuyu is the same blood that runs in a Luo," Kang'ata said. He noted that the decision by Ruto to tour Siaya, the home county of his main challenger in the August 2022 presidential poll Raila Odinga, was the best ever. "You have convened many meetings since becoming the president of this country but this is one is your most important meetings in the entire country," Kang'ata told the president. The governor stressed that every part of the country must be included in the presidential development plan if Kenya is to succeed. "The people of Nyanza deserve development the same way the people of Central Kenya do. Central and Rift Valley will never develop if Luo Nyanza does not." Kang'ata called on the president to appoint more Luos into government. He was speaking in Gangu village, Asembo in Siaya county during the homecoming ceremony of Information Communication and Digital Economy Cabinet Secretary Eliud Owalo. Kang'ata told the congregants that as a member of the United Democratic Alliance party, he will ensure that Kenya remains a united country.
