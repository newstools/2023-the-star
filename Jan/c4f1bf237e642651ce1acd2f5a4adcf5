Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has said 2022 was a tough year but remained hopeful of change in 2023. Karua said Kenyans suffered a high cost of living and a high rate of unemployment. "2022 has been a tough year.... Justice alluded many," she said. In her New Year message on December 1, Karua said even though the new year "appears grim", there was hope. "Raise your voice. Fight for your rights. Challenge your leaders to do better. Happy new year!" she said. Karua was the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition, presidential running mate. The Azimio candidate, Raila Odinga, lost the election to President William Ruto. The coalition dismissed the results as declared by the Independence Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairperson Wafula Chebukati and filed a petition to the Supreme Court. The Apex court, however, ruled in favour of Ruto and upheld his victory in a judgement delivered on September 5, 2022. "Hot air," Karua said on September 27, 2022, after the court released the full judgment. On November 3, Karua moved to the East African Court of Justice seeking to overturn the President's election. "Now is not about the election, it's about justice, the court said our evidence was a hot air balloon, this, can take me to East Africa just to discuss that judgement," she said in September. She however said since the court gave its verdict Kenya should move forward because that is the rule of law and democracy.
