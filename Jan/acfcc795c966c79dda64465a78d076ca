The government will deploy another 360 police reservists to Laikipia to help deal with insecurity in the region, President William Ruto has said. The President said the additional police reservists will augment the efforts by security officers in seeking to end the rampant cattle rustling and banditry. "In the next few months the reservists will be joining those already here because we want to control insecurity in the region," he said. Ruto spoke during an interdenominational church service at the Nanyuki stadium in Laikipia on Sunday. Several people have been killed and thousands of livestock stolen in the area. The livestock have found their way into the ranches causing conflicts. Ruto said they will soon be having a meeting with owners of ranches in the area, to reduce cases of invasion. "We want to have them fence their ranches so that apart from police reservists supporting us in providing security, we avoid cases of conflicts," he said. The President also told the Kenya Wildlife Service to erect barriers that can prevent wild animals from straying into farms causing human-wildlife conflict.
