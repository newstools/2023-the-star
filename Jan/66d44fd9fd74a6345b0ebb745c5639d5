President William Ruto has rejected claims that he is pushing to control Parliament, interfering with its Independence. He said he has no intention of compromising the Legislature. "We will continue to explore avenues of strengthening our Parliament," Ruto said. He spoke in Mombasa on Monday as he opened the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association's Post Election Seminar for MPs. National Assembly leader of minority Opiyo Wandayi said strengthening the Judiciary and the Legislature should be the intention of the government and not the other way round. "What legacy do we want as the 13th Parliament? Do we want to be seen as the weakest in history?" posed Wandayi. National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang'ula said Parliament has a responsibility to the people who elected their representatives to the House. However, he said, there should be a meaningful and respectful way through which legislators engage in order to safeguard the image of the House. "We will differ, but we must learn to differ honourably. We expect nothing less than the conduct deserving of a good leader,"Â  Wetang'ula said. He said raising voices and name-calling in public discourse is demeaning to the leaders and their titles. "We can disagree in a very very soft way. We must not go on megaphones and shout at each other. We can also whisper into the right ears and get things done," he said. "Both ways will get you the result but whispering will get you better results."
