Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said that he must approve for Azimio leaders to have a handshake with President William Ruto. He backed Nairobi governor Jonson Sakaja's sentiments on supporting a Handshake between Azimio leader Raila Odinga and Ruto but said they must seek his consent. Speaking on Friday during the launch of the affordable housing project in Shauri Moyo, Gachagua said that he must vet the leaders first before any meeting with Ruto. "Gavana umesema vizuri, unataka ulete hawa viongozi waongee na Rais lakini lazima wapite kwangu tujadialiane kwanza," he said. (Governor said very well that he wants to bring Raila and Ruto to negotiate for a handshake but they must pass through me first). Gachagua added that Raila must first accept Ruto as the president before any handshake. "Last week Raila said he does not recognise Ruto as the president but he must first pass through me and accept Ruto as the president," he said. Gachagua added that Jubilee does not exist and that the government is for UDA and Kenya Kwanza. He said that Raila was dreaming when he said he does not recognise Ruto. On Monday, during a rally at Kamukunji gardens, Raila said they do not recognise Ruto as a validly elected president. Raila affirmed his stance strongly saying the presidential results were rigged. "We do not recognise the Kenya Kwanza administration as a legitimate government and Ruto as the president or any official in his government," Raila said.
