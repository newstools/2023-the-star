KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have issued a clarification regarding Kenyan flights they cancelled mistakenly. KLM said the said alert, which was only meant for customers in Tanzania, was inadvertently and erroneously shared with their customers in Kenya. "We made a mistake in our rebook policy and initially included Kenya. This is incorrect and we would like to apologise for this," read the statement. KLM had on Friday issued a cautionary alert to its customers, regarding an anticipated interruption of flights in and out of Kenya and Tanzania. The company apologised to its customers, partners and the Government for the inconvenience and damage the said erroneous alert may have caused. "The correct position is that at KLM flights in and out of Nairobi remain as per the schedule and no interruptions are anticipated." They said they communicated the correct position to the relevant government authorities through its Nairobi office. The apology came after the Kenyan Government through the Transport ministry formally made a protest to the Dutch Airline. CS Kipchumba Murkomen termed the alleged civil unrest as not only unfounded, false, and insensitive but also misleading. "I have spoken to Dutch Airline KLM’s Country Representative to Kenya about a false claim posted on their social media on the purported civil unrest in Kenya," Murkomen said in a statement Saturday afternoon. He pointed out that while the Airline has since pulled down the alert from its pages, they intend to escalate the discussion through diplomatic channels to stop its recurrence.
