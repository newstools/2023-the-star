Africa Data Centres has broken ground for its new Sh2 billion Sameer facility in Nairobi that will grow its facility by up to 15 megawatts (MW) of IT load. The new facility set for completion in 2025 will increase the current capacity five-fold bringing five times more than the current capacity. According to ADC The new centre will begin with 5MW of IT load and it be built on the company’s modular design, including all critical plant rooms, prefabricated off-site to ensure the highest possible quality. The new facility will enable customers to benefit from fast access to the cloud and managed services within the diverse ecosystem and increased external network options. “Every organisation today is talking about making technology an enabler. It has informed our decision to expand a lot of big tech organisations are coming into Kenya and that has informed our decision,” said African Data Centre managing director Dan Kwach. ADC will be looking to tap onto the increasing number of firms that have announced plans to venture into the country. Our data centres will be build designed and operated in a way that exploits cutting edge technology and using renewable energy. Kwach added that the new facility will initially cost Sh2 billion but the figure is projected to rise. “To build a megawatt you need between 10-12 million dollars so that means the figure will go higher,” Kwach said on the sidelines of the ground breaking According to Middle East and Africa Data Center Colocation Market - Industry Outlook & Forecast 2022-2027 significant factors that are acting as a factor for the growth of the data center colocation market include increased digitalization initiatives across several countries, cloud service providers collocating the data centers, growth in connectivity, and others.
