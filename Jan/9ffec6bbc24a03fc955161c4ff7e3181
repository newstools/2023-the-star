National Assembly members are headed to the Coast for a seminar aimed at training them on how to do their legislative job better. President William Ruto is expected to give a keynote address and officially open the four-day-long sessions. Parliament is conducting the training together with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA). “The forum will be key to enhancing the capacity of Members of National Assembly to efficiently and effectively perform their constitutional mandate,” a dispatch from Parliament on the meeting reads. It further says that the seminar is aimed at “strengthening members’ understanding of parliamentary practices, procedures and processes.” This would be “while developing a better understanding of the legislative system and democratic processes". “It also expected to manage the seamless transition of new members to ensure they accustom to life in Parliament through the sharing of experiences and managing expectations." As is the practice within the Commonwealth fraternity, the meeting takes place at the beginning of the term for newly elected legislators. The meeting is set to be hosted at the luxurious Pride Inn, Paradise Resort, Convention Centre and Spa, Mombasa County. It comes hot on the heels of a week-long house committees’ induction which was concluded on Saturday. It was marred by protests in agitation for the release of constituency development fund (NG-CDF) cash.
