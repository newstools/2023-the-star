The Council of Governors Ad hoc committee on Managed Equipment Services held a meeting with the ministry of health PS Peter K. Tum. The meeting which took place on Wednesday was chaired by the COG chair Health committee Muthomi Njuki at the COG Offices in Nairobi. Among the issues deliberated was the Managed Equipment Service(MES) program whose 7 years lease period is coming to an end. The officials also discussed measures to be put in place to ensure non-disruption of health services at the counties. The officials resolved that a joint technical team comprising County and Ministry of Health Officials be constituted. The technical team will undertake an assessment of the status of the functionality of the MES equipment in various facilities within 10 days. The technical teams' report will inform both levels of the Government's decision on the MES program.
