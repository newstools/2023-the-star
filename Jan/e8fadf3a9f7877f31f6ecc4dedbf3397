First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto on Thursday inaugurated the Leveraging Equality for Gender Inclusive Economic Development (Legend) Project. In a statement, Mama Rachel said the project is targeted at unlocking access to finance by youth and women-led enterprises in the poultry, horticulture and aquaculture value chains. "The legend project aims to improve the social-economic prosperity of entrepreneurs alongside gender inclusion and environmental sustainability," she said. Mennonite Economic Development Associates (MEDA) will carry out the six-year initiative in nine counties drawn from the Coast and Lake Victoria Regions. The counties include Kwale, Kilifi, Mombasa, Taita-Taveta, Kisumu, Busia, Siaya, Homa Bay and Migori. The First Lady lauded MEDA’s long-term commitment to Kenya’s economic development and the support towards the attainment of Kenya’s Vision 2030 and UN Sustainable Development Goals.
