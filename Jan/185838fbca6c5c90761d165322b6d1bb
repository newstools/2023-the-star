Trade and Investment CS Moses Kuria has said there is a need to privatise some universities in the country. Speaking to the press on Friday, Kuria said some universities are in terrible shape and some are in debt. Kuria said he is in talks with investors to partner with universities and make them better places. "I'm talking to international investors who are willing and ready to come and partner with our universities to privatise some of the universities, I'm not saying all," he said. The CS said the raceÂ to have more and more universities is 'now catching up with them'. "The other government tried by regulating the number of students going to universities then we toyed around with the idea of scholarships for purposes of private students "And you know business and economy have got rules, you can only bend them to some point and now I think the system has been tested up to the limit and its snapping," he said. He added: "So we have two options, we continue hiding our heads in the sand or we face the reality, and the reality is we have to privatise some of our universities." Kuria said his Ministry will work together with the Ministry of Education to establish what is the actual demand for university education in the local market.
