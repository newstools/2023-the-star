National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang'ula has asked elected leaders from Western to put aside their political differences and unite for the sake of the community's development. Wetang'ula said area leaders should shun divisive politics and pursue development agenda. He asked leaders from the region to respect each other and speak one political language. “If I have done something wrong, call me aside as your leader and tell me this is wrong instead of going to a public podium or the media to air our dirty linen in public,” Wetang’ula said. He spoke on Sunday during a funds drive to aid Friends Lirhembe Church in Ikolomani constituency. Wetang'ula said together with Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, they were committed to ensuring that the region's political and economic respect is restored. "If you have seen Musalia, any other leader or even myself err somewhere, just politely tell the leader to correct the error. If you can't access them, then inform those who are closer to that particular person," he said. "Do not undress them in public since that's how communities nurture their leaders." The Speaker said the late President Mwai Kibaki was first elected as an MP in the 1960s but was nurtured until he became the President in 2002. He asked Luhya leaders to walk together and ensure that the journey to State House that was started by the late Vice President Kijana Wamalwa and Masinde Muliro is attained.
