Activist Boniface Mwangi has claimed that former President Uhuru Kenyatta was a traitor in the Azimio coalition. Speaking at the Social Newsroom Show on Wednesday, Mwangi said that Uhuru's support to Azimio made them compete as incumbent instead of opposition. "Let's talk about one traitor, Former President Uhuru Kenyatta let the whole team down. He was not supposed to endorse us.Â  We ended up running as the incumbent but we were not the incumbent we were actually the opposition," he said. Mwangi said that Uhuru damaged Azimio by publicly speaking ill of President William Ruto. "Every time Uhuru spoke he damaged our campaign team, every time he opened his mouth we suffered. I begged and even tweeted about it and said, tell Uhuru to shut up and he couldn't shut up," he said. Mwangi said that he was concerned about Uhuru's loyalty and asked the Azimio campaign team why they trusted him. "I asked friends and people in the Azimio Campaign team, how do you trust someone who has betrayed his deputy and they have worked together for over ten years," Mwangi said. Mwangi said Uhuru damaged Azimio's Campaign team by making Ruto get sympathy votes. He added that the former president was doing things that was uncharacteristic. Uhuru threw his weight to the Azimio coalition in the August 9, 2022 polls. The former President said he decided to work with Raila for the sake of peace, a decision that did not sit well with Ruto leading to a fallout between the two former political soulmates.
