Kenya Volleyball Federation technical director David Lung'aho wants National Olympic Committee of Kenya to increase slots and more time for the Youth Camp that starts today at Merishaw School, Isinya in Kajiado County. Lung'aho added that the 10-day training camp for the juniors isn't enough since it is staged once a year. "The NOC-K program is good but the numbers are less. We need more juniors to join the continuous program. If the camp can run for a month, athletes would really hone their skills properly. We need well-baked athletes who will become world-beaters in the coming years," said Lung'aho. A total of 14 athletes (both boys and girls) have been selected in volleyball. In the boys' category, Justus Kosgei (Lelmokwo), Abel Wasike (Namwela) and Asbel Kirwa (Cheptil) are part of the third edition of the program, which was first held in 2019. Others are Emmanuel Kimutai (Cheptil), Abraham Kipkemboi (Cheptil), and Anderson Kipngetich (Andersen Secondary School). The girls will be represented by Miriam Khisa (Bishop Sulumeti, Lugari), Kesogon duo of Milkah Akinyi and Phanice Nekesa as well as Cheptil's Violah Jepkosgei. Mercy Cherono of St. Mathias Mwitoti and Butere Girls' Mary Juma complete the girls' stellar list. Kevin Nyongesa and Paul Walcott are the beach volleyball athletes. The team will be under coaches Mathias Kosgei, John Marani and Salome Wanjala. The players were mostly selected from top volleyball schools. However, Kwanthanze missed out with Lung'aho explaining:Â "Kwanthanze are training for Africa School Games. They requested to skip this camp training." Meanwhile, Lung'aho hopes there will be no changes for the Kenya Volleyball Federation women's league playoffs, set for Moi Stadium, Kasarani Indoor Arena from January 20-22. "It's been long since we used Kasarani. Our wish is no further venue change. Nyayo is good but Kasarani is the best.The federation must stage some of the league matches at Kasarani," said Lung'aho.
