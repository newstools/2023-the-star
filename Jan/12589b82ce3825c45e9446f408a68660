Lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi has termed ODM leader Raila Odinga's Kamukunji mega rally as 'shenanigans' that are a national embarrassment. "Raila's endless 'shenanigans' aren't normal and are a national embarrassment," he said. Taking to Twitter Ahmednasir, however, said Raila does not deserve unison national condemnation and censure, but understanding and prayers. "He doesn't deserve our unison national condemnation and censure. Raila truly deserves our understanding and prayers," he added. Raila had on Monday, together with Azimio La Umoja leaders held a rally at the Kamukunji grounds to address a report by a whistleblower who alleged the ODM boss had won the August 9 polls. While addressing his supporters, Raila said he does not recognise William Ruto as President. "We do not recognise the Kenya Kwanza administration as a legitimate government and Ruto as the president or any official in his government," he said. He demanded that Ruto and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua resign, claiming they have no mandate from the people or ability to govern them. The coalition will hold another rally at Jacaranda on January 29.
