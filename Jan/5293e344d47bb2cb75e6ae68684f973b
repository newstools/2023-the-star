The prime suspect in the murder of LGBTQ activist Edwin Chiloba has been described by Eldortet residents who know him as a son of a church leader. Neighbours who spoke of him say he cut the image of a good-mannered son of a religious leader. His father is said to be a pastor and a Nyumba Kumi chairman in Huruma estate. "The only thing we can tell you is that Odhiambo’s father is a church leader and our Nyumba Kumi chairman in the Huruma estate. We did not expect his son to be accused of involvement in crime," a resident told Nation. Residents spoke when the detectives visited Odhiambo's parents' home while tracing pieces of evidence that could help in the case. "We have known Odhiambo to be a reserved and respectful man. His being linked to the murder of the University of Eldoret student has shocked everybody," Joseph Wanjala said. "As parents, we cannot defend our children when they are involved in criminal activities. It is important for investigators to do their work and arrest everyone linked to the activist’s killing and ensure justice is delivered." Chiloba was murdered, his body stashed in a metallic box and later dumped along the Kipenyo-Kaptinga road, in Kapsaret, Uasin Gishu. Five suspects have been detained as part of a probe into the murder of Chiloba. Senior Principal Magistrate Richard Odenyo granted the police 21 days to hold the suspects to facilitate the completion of investigations. Odhiambo had sought to be released on bail, claiming that his family will not survive if he remains in custody. "I request to be released on bond so that I can continue with my work to support my family," he said. The case will be mentioned on January 31. An autopsy on the body revealed that Chiloba died of blockage of the mouth and the nose which caused him to lack oxygen. Chief government pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor said he died of smothering which is the shortage of oxygen.
