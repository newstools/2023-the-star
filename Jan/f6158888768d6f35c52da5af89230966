More than 600 casual workers from Nakuru county have decried what they termed as unlawful firing by the county government. The workers said to be under the county's environment department said they received phone calls telling them not to report to work the next day. Additionally, they were asked to return all the work-related equipment that the county had given them. According to the county workers union Secretary General John Ndunda, the workers only discovered that they had been replaced when they reported working. "The 605 workers are from the Department of Environment. Surprisingly when they were reported to work in January, they found new people doing their job," Ndunda said. Ndunda noted that the law requires that casual labourers should be offered permanent employment after working for 90 days. "They were not given notice and the law states that a person who works as a labourer for 90 days should be confirmed as a permanent employee," he said. He added that the workers have held the positions for more than 10 years and he called on Governor Susan Kihika to intervene "We are asking our governor to resolve this issue and reinstate the casual workers immediately," he said. When the Star reached the county human resource person, they responded by saying they will issue a statement soon regarding the matter.
