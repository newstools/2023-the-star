Stakeholders around Lake Naivasha want the five-year ban on sportfishing lifted. They say it is a major source of revenue and employment. The stakeholders said if well managed, sportfishing could be a game-changer as the water body is experiencing many challenges, including illegal fishing and pollution. Through the Naivasha Boat Owners Association, the stakeholders said the sport could be a source of revenue for the county and create jobs. Association chairman David Kilo said lack of guidelines on how to get a sportfishing licence from the department of fisheries was to blame for the current crisis. He said in the past, the sport attracted hundreds of local and international visitors every month, creating jobs and revenue. “During the festive season, there were tens of families eager to engage in sportfishing but due to the ban and lack of guidelines from the fisheries department, we lost business,” Kilo said. He said lifting the ban would reduce illegal fishing, which has depleted stock due to the use of undersize nets. Operator Joel Kuria said at its peak, sportfishing employed tens of youths directly and indirectly. He said sportfishing fans thronged the town every weekend until the exercise was banned in unclear circumstances. “We are appealing to the county government to rethink the decision and lift the ban so that we can get more jobs and revenue,” Kuria said. He said uncontrolled fishing has led to a 40 per cent drop in fish catch and the situation could get worse in the coming days. Naivasha subcounty fisheries officer Nicholas Kagundu blamed unaccounted-for landings for the drop. He said the rising number of illegal fishermen was affecting fish production due to the use of undersized nets in breeding grounds. “We are currently analysing data for the last 12 months and this will help us determine the current catch and any emerging challenges,” he said.
