Nigerian artiste Yemi Alade has joined the list of accomplished artistes featured on the Equal Africa playlist. Yemi said the number of female artistes has increased compared to a decade ago. "The only thing we ask now, in this male-dominated industry, is for equal opportunities," she said. "Equal opportunities to be seen, for our talents to be showcased, because in the ‘universe of music’ there is no gender, only potential, creativity and pure magic." The Spotify Equal Africa programme seeks to provide female artistes with the support and resources to grow their craft and reach worldwide audiences through multiple playlists. The beneficiaries also receive off-platform guidance and tools to help take their music careers to even greater heights.
