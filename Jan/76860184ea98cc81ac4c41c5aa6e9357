Coach Boniface Nyamunyamu says poor finishing remains Vihiga Queens' nightmare despite outshining Kisumu All Starlets 2-0 in a Women's Premier League match at Mumias Sports Complex on Sunday. Anita Namata and Janet Moraa scored for the four-time WPL champions to maintain their unbeaten start to the season. Nyamunyamu said lack of a clinical edge is derailing his team. He said the former Cecafa Club champions would have gotten the job done at halftime had it not been for the profligacy of the strikers. "We appreciate the three points but I am not entirely convinced with how my strikers are playing at the moment," said Nyamunyamu. "Namata scored which is good for her confidence but she needs to do better, especially on one-on-one situations and also tack in most of the tap in chances." Vihiga face a Herculean task away to Thika Queens this weekend. Namata scored a thunderbolt to give the defending champions a deserved 18th minute lead as the Legacy Makers headed into halftime 1-0. Experienced forward Moraa scored from the penalty spot in the 64th minute to double the lead with the goal sealing maximum points for the Vihiga County-sponsored side. Kisumu coach Juma Said slammed poor training and lack of effort from the team. The soft-spoken tactician said: "We didn't play well today (Sunday) for obvious reasons. There's no consistency in training, players attend training in pieces and the result isn't surprising. It isn't that Vihiga are superior but our energy levels need to improve." "The team is not bad but the players need to be committed. Football is all about sacrifice and focus." Kisumu welcome Gaspo at Kenyatta Stadium this weekend with the gaffer demanding a response from his underperforming team. "We have to bounce back in a big way when we play Gaspo. We need to work on all departments," he said.
