Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has downplayed claims that the 2022 KCSE was marred with cheating. The Majority Chief Whip at the Senate said he hoped emerging allegations of cheating in the 2022 KCSE are just mere allegations. "The collapse of the education system is the collapse of a nation,” he said on his Twitter account on Saturday. For the first time, the Ministry of Education did not announce any cancellation of the KCSE exam results or incidents of cheating as it released the results on Friday. A section of politicians however claimed there was massive cheating in last year’s KCSE. While releasing the results, Education Cabinet Secretary Ezekiel Machogu said the KCSE 2022 administration was clean as they had devised various mechanisms to curb cheating. Mukurweini MP Kabando wa Kabando said the 2022 KCSE results should be annulled. East African Legislative Assembly Member of Parliament Kanini Kega also claimed that the results were a major scam. Azimio spokesperson Makau Mutua on the other hand challenged the government to cancel the results and order a redo of the exams.
