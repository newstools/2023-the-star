Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Monday held consultations with the Kenya Tea Development Agency board. The board meeting led by chairman David Ichoho, group MD and CEO Wilson Muthaura aimed at improving earnings for small-scale farmers. Through a statement, Gachagua said they agreed on ensuring small-scale tea farmers reap more benefits. "We discussed and agreed on a strategy of ensuring the small-scale tea farmer reaps more benefits from the cash crop, especially by eliminating cartels," he said. The DP challenged the KTDA directors to work with the government in its bid to streamline the sector. “We recognise you as the legitimate office bearers and we want to work with you because the same people you are serving elected us. We want farmers to increase their earnings and live better lives,” he said. Gachagua also said he will constitute a small team of industry representatives to lead the reforms in the tea sector. The DP had in past events complained that the KTDA had been infiltrated by cartels and brokers who have exploited farmers. "We have created a caucus to guide us on how best to unchain the small-holder tea farmer from the grip of cartels," he said. On Sunday, speaking during an interdenominational thanksgiving at Bomet Green Stadium, Gachagua cautioned cartels in the sectors that their days are numbered. “Your excellency those cartels in these sub-sectors by mid year, if you hear them complaining, assume them. We know you have a big heart with a lot of sympathy but they have traumatised our farmers,” he said. President William Ruto through an executive order 1 tasked Gachagua to lead the government's agenda to reform the coffee, milk and tea sub-sectors.
