Azimio spokesperson Makau Mutua has told President William Ruto to stop glorifying outgoing IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati. In a statement on Wednesday, Mutua said that the truth can't be hidden for long. "The state and its top officials must with immediate effect stop the nonsensical attempts at the beatification of former IEBC chairperson  Wafula Chebukati. The truth like the sun can’t long be hidden," he said. The Azimio spokesperson said Ruto must stop making allegations of a plot to kill Chebukati. This is after Ruto alleged that there was a scheme to abduct, torture and kill Chebukati at the Bomas of Kenya. Some Azimio leaders have also dismissed Ruto's claims calling on him to provide evidence. Jubilee secretary general Jeremiah Kioni said that the claims are utter nonsense and dared Ruto to provide evidence on the same to the relevant authorities. "The President cannot be sitting there and making allegations like a pedestrian. He has the instruments of power. He has to shape up, many of us are disappointed,” Kioni told the Star on the phone. “If the commissioners were being bribed and they did not report it, they are also guilty of an offence. They are the first ones who should be charged.” Ruto said the plot was hatched by a political syndicate that was managing the presidential succession as the ultimate move to force their preferred candidate on Kenyans.
