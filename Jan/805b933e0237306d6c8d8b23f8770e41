Mystery surrounds the murder of a 19-year-old university student whose body was found in a house in Nakuru city. Police say the girl’s boyfriend is a person of interest in the matter. Detectives handling the case said the lifeless body of Phyllis Jepleting, a Maths/Biology first-year student at Karatina University, was found at man’s house at Naka Estate, Nakuru County, on January 1. The body was decomposing then. The man is believed to be the teen's boyfriend and she went missing since Christmas Day, police said. Nakuru County police boss Peter Mwanzo said the body was found in the house after “The man who lives there was not around and locals called police who broke in and found the body lying face down on the bed,” he said. Preliminary findings show the body had blood oozing from the mouth, nose and ears. The suspect is missing and efforts to trace him are ongoing. Police said they do not know the motive of the incident and that the man who is the person of interest had had his mobile phone switched off since Boxing Day. Police who visited the scene said they found Jepleting’s identification documents which were among the items recovered and that she comes from Aldai. Her body was moved to Nakuru Level Five Hospital mortuary awaiting a post-mortem to determine the cause of the death. Jepleting became the second student to die in such circumstances in a week.
