President William Ruto has admitted to giving wrong figures on the amount borrowed by the Hustler Fund. In a roundtable interview with media houses on Wednesday, Ruto was asked about figures he had given on the amount borrowed on the Hustler Fund platform. "You had spoken earlier that some Sh20 billion had been borrowed. The figures we have from the ministry so far as of today are Sh12.8 billion, I don't know how you account for that difference?" Citizen TV journalist Sam Gituku asked the president. He did not rub off the question but explained where he had gone wrong with his calculation. He said he deals with many figures and might be hard to sometimes grab all the numbers accurately. "On the figures, you are correct.Â  I have so many figures by virtue of my position. The amount that we have lent is not Sh21 billion but 12.9 billion as of this evening( Wednesday)," he said. The Head of State said he checked the numbers again and made the correction to his previous statement on wrong figures. "I went and checked the numbers, and my minister actually sent me a text and said, that the Sh21 billion I mentioned is the number of transactions. All the other numbers are right as I mentioned. So there is no discrepancy between my numbers and the others," he said.
