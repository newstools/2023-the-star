Socialite Lady Risper says her husband Brian Muiruri only wants two children, something she is not happy about. Risper said it didn't make any sense that with such a big house her hubby refused for them to have many children. "Nani atamwambia waluhya tunapenda kuzaa," she said. Risper built her eight-bedroom mansion when she was still on the reality show. Risper praised her husband for giving her a good life, saying he worked hard when he lived in the US for 11 years. "I am not married by a mzungu. My husband has a taste of the good life," she said. Risper has three nannies, one for the baby and two for her house. "I pay them good money," she said.
