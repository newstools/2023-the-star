Health champions in Bungoma County have asked the government to procure more ambulances in the health facilities as a way of strengthening the weak referrals within the health sectors. The champions led by Rahma Issa, an advocacy officer from Stage Media Arts (SMA) said that Bungoma is having weak referral systems attributing it to frequent maternal deaths. She was speaking to the press in Bungoma after a one-day workshop to review the County Program based budget (PBB) and the supplementary budget that was recently passed by the county assembly. Issa said that her team has analyzed the supplementary budget and the money that was allocated towards health is not enough to run the important docket. “The whole of today we have been here together with the Community health volunteers analyzing the supplementary budget that was recently passed by the county assembly and we have found out that the money that has been allocated towards health is not enough,” She said. On Monday, Governor Ken Lusaka pledged to invest heavily in primary health care where he said that his administration will hire 246 health workers, 85 nurses and 20 doctors with an aim of improving service delivery. “Covid-19 taught us something nobody could jet out to seek medical services abroad and there is a need to invest heavily in the health sector,” Lusaka said, adding that every ward should have a functional health facility. On her part, Judith Apondi, a community health volunteer told the Star that many health dispensaries in Bungoma don't have the equipment and enough health providers asking the Lusaka administration to move with speed and address the menace. Apondi also asked governor Lusaka to fulfil his promise of increasing the stipend. "We are the ones who push for the PHC in villages therefore we are appealing to our newly elected governor to fulfil his promises," she noted. She appointed out that the fewer ambulances have paralyzed service delivery.
