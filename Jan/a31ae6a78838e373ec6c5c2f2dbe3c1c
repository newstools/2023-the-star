Taita Taveta county’s water firm has declared war on increased theft of pipes and illegal connections. Tavevo Water and Sewerage Company acting managing director Richard Kibengo urged members of the public to report cases of theft of pipes and illegal water connections to help the company deliver services efficiently. “This is part of our commitment to ensuring improved provision of sufficient water and sanitation services to all residents. We are keen to bring to book all those involved in theft and illegal water connection,” Kibengo said on Thursday. He said the company is also keen to reduce water losses from 35 per cent to 20 per cent by 2032. Kibengo said the fight against illegal water connections would ensure an increase in revenue from billed water, which would enable the firm to actualise its 10-year strategic plan. This comes days after a man accused of stealing water pipes was arrested and arraigned in a Voi court The pipes, valued at Sh48,000, were reported to have been stolen from Kishenyi pipeline in Wundanyi in December last year. Meanwhile, Kibengo decried the destruction of water pipes by wild animals in some parts of Voi. He said elephants straying from Tsavo National Park are a threat to human life and service delivery in the water sector. “Extended dry spell as a result of depressed rainfall has forced elephants to encroach on residential areas in search of pasture and water and now vandalise water pipe lines,” he said. Water and Sanitation executive Grantone Mwandawiro asked the Kenya Wildlife Service to intervene and drive the elephants back to the park. He said wild animals have been hindering night shift services and routine maintenance. Mwandawiro said Mbololo and Marungu are the areas most affected by straying wild animals. “The matter needs urgent attention to find a lasting solution and protect the company’s infrastructure. The governor will engage the relevant agency to find a way out,” the CEC said.
