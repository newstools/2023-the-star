The management of Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) has stated that it does not owe a hospital it was embroiled in a dispute with. There were reports the hospital was among the entities in the Health ministry that had outstanding court awards. Treasury reports indicated that the hospital owed another facility trading as Uasin Gishu Memorial Hospital Sh1.7 billion. The amount, the Treasury documents showed, was following a suit against Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. But the Wilson Aruasa-led MTRH dismissed the claim saying the hospital successfully appealed the ruling which slapped it with the award in court damages. In a statement following media reports which highlighted the debt, MTRH said the Court of Appeal decision was set aside by the Supreme Court. “The supreme Court of Kenya's specific orders were that the judgement and order of the Court of Appeal dated 6th October 2017 be and is hereby set aside,” MTRH said in a statement on Wednesday. It indicated that the apex court also declared the judgement of the High court, where the award originated, null and void. “The Supreme Court said that for avoidance of doubt, the judgement of the High Court is null and void,” MTRH said. CEO Aruasa said the Ministry of Health was aware of the position to the effect that the Sh1.8 billion award was nullified by the Supreme Court.
