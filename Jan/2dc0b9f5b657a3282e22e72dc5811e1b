India's two-time Olympian Aditi Ashok  will return to the 2023 Magical Kenya Ladies Open for second time in four years to resume her hunt over the Baobab Course at Vipingo Ridge on the first week of February. Aditi finished one shot behind inaugural winner Esther Henseleit of Germany in 2019 at the time when Kenya had just joined the Ladies European Tour (LET). The Indian star chased the then 20-year-old German all the way, but was left to rue a triple-bogey 6 on the Par-3 eighth which denied her what was going to be her first win on Kenyan soil. It turned out to be a three-way battle between Aditi, Henseleit and Julia Engstrom, but it was the German who had the last laugh. The 2019 edition was incidentally the season finale for the LET that year at Vipingo where Henseleit carded a final day course record (63) to became the third player in LET history to win the Order of Merit and Rookie of the Year titles in the same season. Although no one knows what's up Aditi's sleeves, it will be interesting to see how her rivalry with Henseleit pans out in the four-day 72-hole stroke play extravaganza which serve as the LET's season-opener. The 2023 global schedule will take the LET to 21 different countries, starting with the Magical Kenya Ladies Open, which will be played for the third time in Kenya since it was first held in 2019. Aditi was among the stars of the belated Olympics held in the Japanese capital in 2021. After being in second position for almost the whole duration of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and raising hopes of an unexpected podium place, Aditi  had to suffer disappointment when she finished outside the medal bracket after 72 holes of the women’s individual event by just one shot The Bangalore player plies her trade on both the Ladies European Tour and LPGA Tour. The 2016 LET Rookie of the Year made her Olympic Games debut at the 2016 Summer Olympics.
