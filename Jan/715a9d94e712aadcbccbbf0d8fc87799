Water and Irrigation Principal Secretary Paul Kiprono Ronoh on Friday condemned the system of supplying water to Kenyans through water kiosks as it had no place in modern society. Ronoh called for shift from what he called the old-fashioned way of supplying water, saying it it was demeaning amounted to treating citizens as cattle. "People are not cows to be provided with water through Kiosks and Water troughs. They derserve metered water connections at their homes," the PS said. He was speaking in the Kitui town offices of the Tanathi Water Works Authority, where he paid a courtesy call on the CEO Fredrick Mwamati. Ronoh was in Kitui to inspect a number of water installations and projects under the Tanathi Water Works and the Kitui county government. He also paid a courtesy call on the Governor Julius Malombe and the county commissioner Erastus Mbui. The PS said he was surprised Mwamati told him that many peopleÂ  in Kitui county were served with water through water kiosks. He said provision of water could not be rated on the amount of water given out through water kiosks, saying household connection was the way to go. Ronoh also said stern action would be taken against contractors working on water projects who do shoddy work, or are unable to complete works within the given time frame. The PS was particularly concerned that a contractor who was doing the Sh800,000 million Matuu-Kitui last mile water connectivity had not completed the works since 2029. He ordered the Water secretary in his ministry to carry out investigation on the project and establishe whether the 42 per cent payment to the Nigeria BMK contractors was justified. Ronoh said following the outcome of the probe that should get underway immediately, some individuals were likely to find themselves in hot soup, and might even be jailed for misuse of public funds.
