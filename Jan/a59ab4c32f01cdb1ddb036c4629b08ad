The Rotary Club of Kisii is seeking support as they plan to host the inaugural Rotary Sunshine Rally next month. The club’s president Isabelle Lumumba said the rally will be held at Kisii Cultural Hall and brings together children abled differently from the Western Kenya region and Rift Valley on February 25. Other rallies to be hosted by Rotary District 9212 will be held in Nairobi region at Jamhuri showground on March 4 and Mt Kenya region on March 18 at Kirinyaga University. During the event, disabled children from schools and homes will be entertained, medically assessed, learning materials, hygiene items, dewormed, and registered with National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPWD). “Besides that, we shall donate equipment wheelchairs, walkers, and hearing aides to improve their quality of life. This will depend on their needs,” she said. “We have reached out to various institutions like the county governments, financial institutions, hospitals, and individuals to help us make this day a success." Speaking to the Star in Kisii town on Wednesday, she said this is the first Sunshine Rally to be done outside Nairobi. About 700 children from eight primary schools, one secondary school and from homes are expected. “We want to celebrate and make them smile. We are asking local musicians and DJs to volunteer and entertain them during the day,” she said. Further, she asked parents to stop hiding disabled children at home. “Some parents are not aware of the education and opportunities that are there for children abled differently."
