Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna has castigated Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua over his recent remarks on his alleged tiff with Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja. In a statement on Monday, Sifuna said that governors are not supposed to report to Gachagua. "DP Gachagua has in the past few weeks had a tiff with Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja over management of city affairs. But he has now gone a step further and reportedly declared that he can direct any governor on what to do. I now take it upon myself to educate the DP," he said. Sifuna said that he isÂ mandated to protect the interest of the county in his capacity as Nairobi Senator. The Senator said that Nairobi residents have stated unequivocally that they want change in the city. "Changing the city cannot happen by making it a large kiosk paradise or a big matatu terminus under the guise of "Kazi ni Kazi," he said. Sifuna said that the city must change how it runs and one individual or tribe cannot hold Nairobi hostage. He said Nairobi rejects Gachagua's invitation to elevate some tribes to superior positions over others saying all tribes in Kenya as well as foreign nationalities dwell in harmony in Nairobi. Sifuna claims that the DP overestimates himself and his influence in Nairobi politics. He urged Sakaja to proceed to execute his agenda in the way he sees fit because he will account to Nairobi residents and not Gachagua. Gachagua has since asked matatu operators and other businesspeople to remain put and continue with their businesses assuring them of government protection. He cautioned Sakaja against removing public service vehicles from the CBD in a move to decongest the city. Sakaja has, however, maintained that there is no bad blood between him and Gachagua. Speaking on Sunday after a church service at Pefa South B, Sakaja said there were no issues between them as is being portrayed.
