The supporters of Azimio chief Raila Odinga left him way before President William Ruto's Nyanza visit, Evans Kidero has said Speaking during an interview with K24 on Wednesday, the former Homa bay governor candidate said that Raila discovered later that his allies had left him. "Baba discovered that the people who he thought were his had already left, his core supporters have already gone and are working with the government to build one Kenya,"  Kidero said. He added that Odinga is now trying to reinvent himself.  Kidero said Ruto's visit to Nyanza was a great step towards uniting Kenyans. "When Ruto visited Nyanza as President at the first time some leaders who support Baba ran away and left him but that was not the case in his second visit," he said. Ruto toured the three Luo Nyanza counties of Kisumu, Homa Bay and Siaya. Kidero, however, said Raila had asked his troops to welcome Ruto after meeting leaders from the region in Nairobi.
