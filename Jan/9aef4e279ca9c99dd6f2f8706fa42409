The pioneer learners of Grade seven reported to their respective primary schools on Monday for the start of their Junior Secondary school education. Education CS Ezekiel Machogu was at Nairobi Primary school to assess the registration process on the first day of the learners experience. Over 1.26 million learners will be enrolled to join Junior secondary within their respective primary schools. The admission follows the distribution of textbooks, uniform directives and ongoing teachers recruitment. The Ministry of Education directed that no parent should be compelled to buy uniform at a specific store. Machogu said every learner will receive one textbook for core subjects and the optional subjects.
