Kenyan boxer Daniel Wanyonyi has promised to silence his Tanzanian opponent Karim Mandonga 'Mtu Kazi' during their fight on Saturday. Speaking on Thursday after their weigh-in at Kencom, Nairobi CBD, Wanyonyi, 39, said the hype man's antics end on Thursday ahead of their 10-round super-middleweight fight at the KICC. "His nonstop talk has ended today, tomorrow we shall know who's the real deal. He has talked too much but we are now done with that, the fight is tomorrow," Wanyonyi said. The Tanzanian boxing sensation weighed in at 83kgs while Wanyonyi tipped the scales at 80kgs. Upon arrival in Kenya on Wednesday, 43-year-old Mandonga said he will unleash a new technique from Ukraine dubbed 'Sungunyo' on his opponent. "Let them know that I will teach Wanyonyi a lesson, because I feel strong, fearing nothing. I have worked hard; those who work hard like me know no failure, no! I have brought the punch I promised Kenyans, a hard one made in Ukraine, it is called 'Sugunyo',” Mandonga said. Wanyonyi, however, promised to flow the 'mouthy' Mandonga saying he on his part is talented at throwing punches. "Everyone was given a talent, he was given the talent to talk, I was given the talent to fight. Let's meet tomorrow. If he handles all the rounds it's okay, but if he fails, that's his problem," he said. Wanyonyi, who runs a clothing business at Gikomba Market, has an impressive record of  27-14-2, 22 KOs against Mandonga's 3-3-1, 1KO. Saturday's fight will be Mandonga's first bout outside Tanzania, something Kenyan boxing fans said for the comical effect that it was his first time on a plane. The fight between the two fighters at the KICC Ballroom at 6pm will be a curtain raiser for the main bout between Kenya's Rayton Okwiri and Tanzania's Ally Ndaro. Okwiri will be playing his first match this year after the one against Kassim Ouma of Uganda was cancelled due to a lack of payment from the promoters.
