Senior civil servants have been urged to mentor junior staff in their departments to ensure seamless and effective service delivery This message was conveyed to civil servants by the Acting Secretary to the State Department of Public Service, Management Consultancy Services Directorate, David Kanji. Kanji was speaking during the farewell party on Saturday for the recently retired officers in the department under the Ministry of Public Service, Gender and Affirmative Action. “Mentoring and imparting knowledge and competencies to newly recruited as well as junior officers is a sure way of ensuring the effective delivery of services seamlessly,” he said. For a long time, senior civil servants have been accused of hoarding knowledge and skills till retirement. They have been said to be reluctant to pass it on to their juniors and allow them to succeed them. The practice is said to transcend even across other sectors including the Private Sector. "Effective and efficient service delivery is key to the success of Government” “With your vast experience and expertise, you need to work closely with junior officers to help them become effective and result driven and also help them in their career progression," Kanji said
