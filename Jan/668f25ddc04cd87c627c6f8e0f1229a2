Narok senator Ledama Olekina has responded to Governor Patrick Ole Ntutu after saying he was not invited to President William Ruto's event. The senator laughed off the idea that he would even attend the event. "Governor of Narok Ole Ntutu is smoking leaves of Mary Jane instead of the real thing! In his right mind does he think I can attend a UDA rally ?" he posed. Ruto is expected to visit Narok county over the weekend for an Interdenominational prayer service. Governor Ntutu had referred to Ledama as someone who likes being on TV and social media. On Wednesday,Â Ntutu who was speaking in regard to the President's anticipated visit to the county, followed by a Sunday service said Ledama may not grace the event. "Hakuna kitu tunamwambia, unajua yeye ni mtu wa TV hutatampata hapa kwa ground, unajua yeye ni mtu wa social media na TV, so yeye ataomba huko kwa social media," he said This is loosely translated as: We will not tell him anything, you know he is a social media and TV person, you will not find him at the stadium, so he can just have his own service on social media. Several leaders from the Kenya Kwanza administration will be in attendance, and Ntutu urged residents to attend. It was, however, not expected that Ledama would attend the president's event, as it will happen at the same time as Azimio La Umoja's Jacaranda rally. Ledama is expected to attend it being an ODM elected senator. The parallel meetings will see another verbal political exchange between the leading coalitions in the country.
