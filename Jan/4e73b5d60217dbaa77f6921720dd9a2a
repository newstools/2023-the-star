Kenyans on Twitter have reacted to an undated video of two boys who are seen beating a man who is alleged to be their father. The two boys each with their whip were beating the man who looked helpless sitting on the floor. There were some elders around but none seem to be helping the man. 'Ici ni ciana ciake........ici ni ciana ciake ciramutandika' which loosely translates to, "these are his children....these are his children who are beating him," a woman was heard saying. Some words by the adults were not well audible. Kenyans were angered by the incident with some saying it is wrong to beat a parent regardless of their offence while others said police should follow up on the matter. "Beating a parent however much he/she is wrong can attract a curse from God. We should all be careful as we engage them. Be fair to these seniors," Abuga Makori EGH, MBE said. "This is wrong in all aspects; no matter the seriousness of the offence, elderly people must be respected n given a chance to explain with respect," Eng Yamaguchi M said. "The @DCI_Kenya should investigate this matter, there's no law in Kenya that allows this. It's very painful and sad," Peter said.
