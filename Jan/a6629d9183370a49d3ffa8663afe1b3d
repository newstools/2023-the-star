Two people have been killed in Kitengelea accident on the eve of January 1. Police said the two were crossing the road after shopping before they were hit by a speeding car. “The two, a mother and daughter, were crossing after shopping. The mother died on the spot, while the daughter died while being rushed to hospital,” Kitengela OCS David Shani said. Shani also said there were no crime incidents reported between December 20 and 30 in Kitengela contrary to the previous years. “We did our best as my officers provided 24-hour surveillance in estates that have been rated for high criminal activities. I am happy there were zero cases of mugging and house-breaking,” he said. Shani congratulated the residents for keeping them on their toes. He said he gave out his phone contacts to the members of the public so that they could always alert him whenever there are suspicious incidents.
