Menengai Oilers head coach Gibson Weru said the side needs to improve on defence and decision-making when the league resumes on Saturday. The Kenya Cup losing finalists are second on the log with 19 points after 100 per cent record since the start of the season. However, the tactician says work needs to be done on the two aspects of their game. “After analysing our performances thus far, we have seen gaps in our defensive alignment and decision-making. For us to maintain our high standards going into the new year, we have to improve and ensure we are well-rounded in all facets of play,” added Weru. He believes the return of John Okoth, Geoffrey Ominde and Clinton Odhiambo — who played for the Simbas during the repechage and Currie Cup — will boost the team going forward. “Fielding players who have experience with the national team is a major boost since they have learned tactics and strategies by playing and watching how various teams play,” said Weru. “It helps us in our planning as a technical bench.” Oilers face cross-town rivals Nakuru on Saturday, where Weru expects a tough derby. “They (Nakuru) are quality a team and, on their day, can cause problems. However, we are more than ready for them. The boys have put in a good shift in terms of training over the festive period and we are looking forward to a good game on Saturday,” said Weru. He attributed the teams early season form to a robust pre-season, which saw them play at the Impala floodlit. “We had a solid pre-season but we can’t get carried away there is a long way to go. We also know the standards we have set for the last couple of seasons and we are going all out to win the Kenya Cup,” added. KCB lead the standings with 20 points with Oilers and Kabras joint second with 19 points. Mwamba and Blak Blad complete the top five with 10 and nine points respectively.
