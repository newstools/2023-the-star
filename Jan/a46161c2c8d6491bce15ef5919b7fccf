Stivo Simple Boy has described his late dad Anthony Adera as one who supported his talent. Speaking to Word Is, Simple Boy said it was unfortunate that he did not enjoy much of his son's hustles. "My dad was not sick, he rested peacefully. We have not done the postmortem to know what killed him," he said. Stivo said his mum is slowly accepting the loss. "She has been very weak but we are supporting her. I am requesting my fans to support me so I can give my dad a befitting sendoff. The budget is Sh400k," he said. He said burial dates will be communicated later. The news was announced by Stivo's management. Stivo also asked his fans to pray for him and his family during this difficult time. "I am grateful to my fans for supporting me all this time," he said.
