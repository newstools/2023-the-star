Protests rocked Masimba town in Masaba South in Kisii county on Monday over what was termed as dismal KCSE examination results posted by area secondary school. Parents who joined the demos demanded the removal of Masimba High school Principal Joel Nyabuti together with his teachers. The school had registered a mean score of 2.16, a significant decline from the past. Also wanted to be kicked out are board members of the school and the Sub-County education officers. The parents accused them of laxity sparking poor results by a number of schools in the area. Abel Nyangenya, a parent, said the decline began soon after Nyabuti was posted there. "What we want is the government to reconsider his further presence around, we are yet any fruits since he came here," Nyangenya told journalists. The school is in the backyard of Education Minister Ezekiel Machogu. Nyangenya said Masimba High school should be setting a good example by being in the CS's backyard. Ongeri Getanda, another parent, accused the teachers and the head teacher of laxity which has sparked massive failures in the examinations over the last six years. "The funny thing is that he says we cannot push him out. We want to know who are these tall relatives at TSC who by extension are the cause of the pain we are going through as patients," Getanda fumed. They told Education CS to quickly find the Principal's replacement as part of the efforts to turn the fortunes of the school. "Without a new principal, the protests will continue. We will not sit down and watch out school, with all these infrastructural investments going to the drain," added Getanda. Police early charged the parents and kicked them out of the school compounded after they threatened to enter the office and eject the besieged school head. The Star could not immediately get a response from Nyabuti as he was held up in a meeting with education officers.
