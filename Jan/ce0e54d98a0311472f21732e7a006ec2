Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has said that Azimio will hold a peaceful rally. In a statement on Sunday, the legislator said that police had agreed to provide security. "Today, [we] will hold a peaceful rally at Jacaranda Grounds. Police have agreed to provide security," he said. Azimio will hold its second rally at Jacaranda grounds days after the Kamukunji rally. Despite the push from some leaders to cancel the rally, Raila on Saturday maintained the Jacaranda rally is still on. Religious leaders have expressed concern that the political rallies might jeopardize national peace, cohesion and security. Dozens of police have been mobilized to ensure security for the event. Nairobi police boss Adamson Bungei said his team had met with organizers of the event and agreed on various modalities. This will ensure it starts and ends well. “No one wants chaos. We are here for all,” he said. Raila claimed that Ruto did not trounce him in the August 9 polls and he therefore must resign as President. On Saturday, Raila's allies toured the Jacaranda ground to assess preparations for the rally. Raila will this morning attend a church service at Wanyiri area ahead of the Jacaranda rally in the afternoon.
