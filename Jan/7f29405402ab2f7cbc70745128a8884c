Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition spokesman Makau Mutua has said he cannot and will not accept William Ruto as the President of Kenya. Speaking on Monday, Mutua said that his freedom of conscience and thoughts cannot allow him to do so. “My freedom of conscience and thought, I can't accept, or recognize, William Samoei Ruto as President of Kenya. I can't and won't,” he said. Responding to his statement, Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen called him out claiming that what Mutua said was nothing new. The CS took the Azimio spokesman down memory lane and claimed he said the same thing about retired President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017. “After the 2017 elections you said the same thing about the Presidency of Uhuru Kenyatta," Murkomen said. During the Kamukunji rally, Odinga said he will not recognize President William Ruto's 'illegitimate' Presidency and his government, maintaining that the 2022 presidential poll was marred with irregularities. Odinga who returned to the country from South Africa called on Kenyans to resist the Kenya Kwanza government, which he said. conned their way into leadership. He demanded that the Kenya Kwanza government resigns, saying they neither have the mandate nor the ability to govern the country. “We as Azimio reject the 2022 election results. We cannot and will not recognize the Kenya Kwanza regime and consider the Kenya Kwanza government illegitimate. We don’t recognize William Ruto as the President,” Odinga stated amid cheers from the crowd. Odinga insisted that he won the 2022 elections with over two million votes, citing the alleged dossier released by the ‘whistleblower’.
