Narok Senator Ledama Olekina has said the legitimisation of trade between Kenya and Somalia will minimise the number of deaths. "As long as a bag of sugar cost Sh2500 in Somalia and Sh7500 in Kenya our men and women in uniform will continue being brought home in bags!" he said on Tuesday. "Simply open Mandera, El Wak, Dif, Liboi and Kiunga borders and put a customs office to legitimise trade otherwise contraband wins." On December 29, 2022, Defence CS Aden Duale held bilateral talks with Somalia Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre in Mogadishu. The duo discussed a range of bilateral issues among them the regional security situation, joint anti-terror operations, cross-border movements, and economic relations between the two countries. According to Duale, Somalia has had its share of forced instability caused by rifts and wars noting that even amidst all these challenges, they have continued to be Kenya’s good neighbours and friends. Duale also held a meeting with President Ahmed Madobe in Kismayo, Jubaland. He and the vice chief of Defence Forces Lt Gen Francis Ogolla had visited KDF troops serving under the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) at sector six headquarters in Kismayu, Somalia in a bid to boost their morale.
