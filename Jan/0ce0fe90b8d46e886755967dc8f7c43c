Kenya Ports Authority resumed training on Thursday ahead of the second leg of the men's Kenya Volleyball Federation league matches at Nyayo Stadium from February 10-12. According to the fixtures released on Wednesday, KPA will play Prison Central, Western Prisons and Equity Bank. A total of 24 matches will be on the cards for the three-day championship. KPA coach Sammy Mulinge said he expects a tough challenge from their opponents but called on his young charges to rise up to the occasion. "We have returned to training and there's no time to waste. We want to give the young lads a chance to showcase their talent because we will be without three key players." KPA finished second last season but have lost the trio of Enock Mogeni, Peter Kamara and Dennis Omollo who have gone for professional stints abroad. "The squad is not as strong as last season hence the need for thorough preparations both for the league and the African Club championship. Our rivals have recruited heavily but we need to take the matches seriously. The season is only getting started but every match is important." Defending champions the General Service Unit have a date with Kenya Prisons, Trail Blazers and Rift Valley Prisons. Kenya Prisons will also ruffle feathers with Kenya Defence Forces and Vihiga county team. GSU will be without Abiud Chirchir, Brian Melly and Simon Kosirai. GSU coach Gideon Tarus said: "We will deal with our opponents the way they come. We respect all teams and we would like to pick up from where we left off." Blazers, who finished third in the playoffs last season, will hope to go one step better when they take on Administration Police Kenya and KDF. Equity bank will navigate its way past Western Prisons and Vihiga. Minnows Prisons Central must shake off the underdogs' tag in the derby duels against Nairobi and Mombasa Prisons teams. Kenya Forest Service lock horns with Kenya Army, Prisons Nyanza and AP.
