Leaders from the Catholic Church in Kenya on Tuesday signed the condolence book of the late Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican Embassy in Nairobi. They were led by Cardinal John Njue. Others were Apostolic Nuncio in Kenya Archbishop Bert Van Megan, Archbishop Philip Anyolo and Archbishop Martin Kivuva. Pope passed away on New Year's Eve at his residence at the Vatican’s Mater Ecclesiae Monastery, at 95, almost a decade after he stood down because of ill health. His lay in rest began on Monday at the Vatican, where his body will be displayed for three days in an open casket at St Peter's Basilica, with people allowed to pay their respects until 7 pm each evening. Pope Benedict will be buried on January 5. In its communication, the Vatican said the service will be simple, solemn and sober. Benedict asked that the funeral be marked by simplicity, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni told journalists. The funeral will take place in St Peter's Square before Pope Emeritus is laid to rest in the tombs beneath the Basilica.
