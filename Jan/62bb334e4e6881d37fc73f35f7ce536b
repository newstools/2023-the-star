Zari Hassan and her lover Shakib Cham visited her late husband's grave Ivan Ssemwanga over the weekend. In a video, Zari is seen at Ssemwanga's grave with friends as Shakib is seated a metre from her. Ivan died in 2017. He had sired three sons with Zari in their 12-year marriage: Pinto, Raphael and Quincy Semwanga. He moved to South Africa in 2002 with the help of his cousin, where he ventured into providing education services. Before his death, Ivan together with Zari were running the Brooklyn colleges, which has six branches spread across South Africa. Ivan had several mansions in Uganda and two posh houses in Sandton and Pretoria, South Africa. Paying tribute to him at the time, Zari described him as the greatest of all time.
