Narok Senator Ledama Olekina has said that the current Members of Parliament will fail in their oversight role. According to Ledama, despite President William Ruto insisting on the National Assembly and Senate working together to oversight the executive, this will not be easy. He claimed that the Head of State only invited legislators from parties allied to the Kenya Kwanza administration to discuss his agenda for the country. The Senator said such a move is dangerous for democracy. "Parliament must work together to check the Executive! By inviting only KK Members of Parliament to discuss his agenda for Kenya, William Ruto has made it clear it’s a single-party government! This is dangerous for the democracy of Kenya. MPs will definitely fail on their oversight," Ledama said. The Narok Senator's remarks come after President Ruto met Senate and National Assembly representatives at the Cabinet retreat, held at the Fairmont Mt Kenya Safari Club in Nanyuki, Laikipia county. During the retreat, the President asked the two Houses to work in unison. Ruto said he would not want to see the two Houses dragging each other to court. “We will find a framework that will deal with any disputes that arise between the Senate and National Assembly,” he said. The Head of State regretted that public resources were being wasted in settling conflicts between public institutions. “Government entities should not take each other to court unnecessarily; they must endeavour to settle their issues out of court," he said. During the retreat, Ruto also met governor representatives who included those from opposition parties.
