Bunyore Starlets head coach Daniel Arunga is confident his side will wrap up this year's  Women's Kenya Premier League in the top four. He said his girls have been on the rise and their recent draw against Vihiga Queens at Momboha grounds was an indication of their huge agenda this year. Arunga said they lost home and away against Vihiga Queens, observing that there was great improvement in their performance. “Securing a point against Vihiga Queens is a big achievement. However, it's not time to be complacent as we have to build up on the draw and remain focused,” Arunga said. “We started the season well and we hope to maintain the pace and ensure we utilise our chances." The team captain Priscah Ambale cited teamwork as their biggest weapon. “Teamwork helped us scatter Vihiga's plans and this is just the beginning,” Ambale cited. Vihiga Queens' head coach Bonface Nyamunyamu said Bunyore Starlets had improved tremendously and no one should underrate them. “Underrate those girls at your own peril. They are enjoying top form and I expect them to surprise some big names in the league,” Nyamunyamu said. Nyamunyamu's sentiments come after Bunyore also beat Ulinzi and Thika Queens before securing a draw against Wadadia in their earlier matches. Bunyore have just one loss so far this season, against Kisumu Starlets.
