President William Ruto has affirmed his position that he is not ready for 'handshake' talks with opposition leader Raila Odinga. Ruto said that he will not allow the opposition to change their priorities by dancing to their tunes. He made the remarks during an interdenominational prayer service at William ole Stadium on Sunday. " We are not ready for talks with leaders whose intentions are to fight for their positions," Ruto said. He further said that they will not seek permission from any anyone to work for Kenyans. The president said he will work with all the leaders despite their political affiliations. "We will not engage with leaders who are out to divide people because it is a collective responsibility to serve all Kenyans. Those who are in opposition should Play their oversight role and leave us to run the government, " he said. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi said that the current economic crisis being experienced in the country was contributed by Azimio La Umoja leaders when they were in government with the former administration. "The economy was at its knees when we took over the leadership of this country because errors of commission accumulated during their time," said Mudavadi. He called on Raila to wake up to the reality and accept that Ruto is the president after he was trounced in the last polls. In attendance were Governors Patrick ole Ntutu,(Narok), Hillary Barchok (Bomet), Ann Waiguru (Kirinyaga) and Joseph Lenku (Kajiado).
