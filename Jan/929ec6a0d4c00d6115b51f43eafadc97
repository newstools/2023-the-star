Radio personality Maina Kageni has urged Kenyans to embrace domestic tourism as his lobby eyes regional travel. Kageni, who is also the Tembea Tujenge Kenya brand ambassador, domestic travel is a major contributor to the growth of the tourism sector. The Classic 105 Radio presenter said the tourism sector largely depends on domestic tourists with the Tembea Tujenge Kenya initiative helping open up new tourism destinations in the country. According to Kageni Tembea Tujenge Kenya initiative was able to achieve 67,000-bed capacity last year which enabled them to sell jobs in the hospitality industry. “Through this campaign, the domestic market segment has remained a key player in the tourism sector, and we have achieved a 66,000-bed conversion and saved over 45,000 jobs in the hospitality industry in just the last 2 years,” said Kageni. Kageni spoke during a Tembea Tujenge Kenya event over the weekend. Tembea Tujenge Kenya CEO, Andrew Kanyutu said that so far they have managed to visit 27 counties with the remaining 20 counties set to be covered in 2023. On January 27 they will visit Nyeri County. Further, Kanyutu said that the Tembea Tujenge Kenya will now spread its section to the East African region after ascending its growth in domestic tourism over the last two years. The countries being targeted include; Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. "We have extended the same concept in the region where we are looking at signing East Africa as a block,’’ Kanyutu said. Nyandarua, Laikipia, Nakuru, and are some of the counties that have partnered with Tembea Tujenge Kenya in a bid to promote local tourism.
