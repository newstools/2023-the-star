KCB assistant coach Dennis Mwanja said he expects a tough test from Strathmore Leos when the two side face-off in a Kenya Cup match this weekend. The bankers humiliated Mwamba 82-10 last weekend but Mwanja, a former Kenya sevens skipper expects, a competitive match against the varsity side. "Strathmore are a good side. We know they are chasing a playoff spot and won their last game. It will be a hard fought game between two strong teams," said Mwanja. Mwanja said despite the big win against Mwamba, there are still some areas that need improvement. "Our strike rate in the opposition's 22, set-piece and defensive alignment needs to be better heading into the second half of the season," added Mwanja. The bankers top the log with 30 points from six matches and Mwanja said the target for the season is to to top the standings to allow them host both the semi-final and the final. The tactician added  that competition in the squad is high especially after the eight-time champions signed four players during the mid-season transfer window. "It's a good headache to have as a coach when you have several players playing in various positions. This creates depth especially when the league is entering a very critical phase," he said. The Thika Road outfit signed Kenya Sevens international Edmund Anya and Billy Omondi from Impala, alongside Kenya under 20 international Elvis Kolian from Menengai Oilers and Festus Shiasi from Strathmore Leos. The bankers relinquished the Kenya Cup crown at the semifinal stage last season, losing 24-18 to Menengai Oilers.
