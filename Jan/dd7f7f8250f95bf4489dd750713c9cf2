National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung’wa has urged MPs to always put their political affiliations aside whenever matters about the welfare of Kenyans are before the House. He said the voice of reason should prevail on every MP where the people’s welfare is concerned. “As much as we hold firm political party positions, grandstanding must never come in the way of well-intended and noble decisions that the National Assembly make in the line of its constitutional mandate,” he said. Ichung’wa pledged to endeavor to have matters resolved across the divide with the Minority Party. “Similarly, and more importantly, we must as National Assembly come together to play our rightful role to ensure effective oversight of the Executive at all times by confirming that the actions of government are addressing emergent needs and that good governance is entrenched in our society,” he said. He made the remarks during a post-election seminar for MPs at Pride-Inn Paradise Beach Resort and Spa, Mombasa. The seminar was hosted by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) and the leadership of the National Assembly. Ichung’wa added that a review of the National Assembly Standing Orders is critical to the realisation of your government’s agenda for this great nation. “We shall initiate a review of the rules of procedure to align them to the government’s agenda while protecting the independence of the National Assembly to safeguard its constitutional mandate and the public interest,” he stated. He said the seminar is timely as it comes at the tail end of the first long recess of the 13th Parliament and will therefore refresh and enrich the knowledge of MPs on the work of the National Assembly.
