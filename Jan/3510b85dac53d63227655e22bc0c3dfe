Education CS Ezekiel Machogu has blasted critics after a row of allegations that there was massive cheating during the 2022 KCSE exams. Speaking during an event on Friday, Machogu came in full swing and was prepared to answer the swan of questions being raised by journalists. He dismissed the allegations that the results showed an increased number of Grade As. “I want to make it clear that when we were briefing the categories and I went to various counties with meetings and all those concerned with the administration of exams, I did that because I want us to have an exam where integrity has not been compromised,” Machogu said. "I have seen a lot of misrepresentation and a lot of people coming up with information that is not true." He went ahead to give a breakdown of how many As were produced by each county. Machogu was responding to allegations that his region produced 800 As. “Don’t profile communities saying because the cabinet secretary comes from this region they passed,” Machogu said. He said Migori was the top county with 66As. “If we were to rate counties then Nyamira would be number 40,” he said. He added that Kisumu had 59 As, Kisii 50, Homa Bay 47 and Nyamira 31.
