Reigning African Club champions KCB have unveiled four new players as they prepare for the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) league playoffs this weekend. Faith Cherotich, Elizabeth Mariana and Pauline Chemutai join the Japheth Munala led KCB from Kwanthanze Secondary school as outside hitter  Juliana Namutira was snapped from KDF. The club’s technical director, Paul Bitok, who doubles up as the national team coach received the players in a contract signing ceremony held at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani Indoor Arena, Nairobi. Bitok hailed Mariana, who becomes the first volleyball player from the MAA community to join a team competing in the topflight local league. The three players joining from Kwanthanze are below 20 and are tipped to inject new energy into the team as they look to win this season’s title. “By signing up these young players, we are looking at tapping into the talent of upcoming sports stars and to give them a chance to shine on the global stage," said Bitok. "This will be a significant step in the development of volleyball in the local scene while also ensuring that players make a living out of the sport.” KCB begin their playoffs campaign against DCI on Friday afternoon before facing Kenya Prisons on Saturday and battle Kenya Pipeline on Sunday.
