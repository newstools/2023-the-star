Blow to business people as Nairobi Deputy Governor Njoroge Muchiri said that the unified single business permit charges will not change. Speaking on Monday in a Tv interview, the DG said that City hall will only simplify the process of getting the licences. “There is a bit of misconception. I have talked to business people and there is an expectation that if it’s a unified business permit, it will be priced differently but it's not the case,” Muchiri said. The DG clarified that the process will be simplified but the cost will still be the same “What we intend to do is simplify the process of getting the licenses. It’s good to clarify this for business people that the cost they have been incurring used to be part of the process." Earlier this year, Sakaja announced that the process of the unified single business permit plan was 85 per cent complete. It was to start in March, 2023. “By March, Nairobi will have a unified single business permit. The process is almost complete and I ask residents to be patient,” he said. Before the August 2022 elections, Sakaja pledged to introduce a single QR-enabled permit which he said will prevent the need of having multiple licences and subsequently eliminate the hurdles of doing business. "We shall unify the licenses so that it will be easier and faster for people to pay revenue and it will improve the county’s collection,” he said. The business permits are city council business permits, fire inspection certificates, food handler certificates, food hygiene, goodwill, and land rates for those who own land within the Nairobi jurisdiction. These business permits and licenses are renewed yearly by members of the public and the business community.
