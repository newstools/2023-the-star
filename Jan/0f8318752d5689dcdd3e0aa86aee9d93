The Pharmacy and Poisons Board has warned Kenyans against using unauthorised Home DNA Test Kits which are marketed on digital platforms for retail. In a statement on Thursday, the board said that they have not authorized any retailer to sell the kits. "Please note that the PPB has not authorised any retailer to sell such Kits and hereby appeal to the public to be on the lookout for retailers marketing these Kits," the statement read. This is after a home DNA test collection kit was declared available at various pharmacies at a retail cost of Sh800. Paternity tests are one of the most contentious issues in many marriages, many billed the kit as a game changer in helping men to determine whether the children they have been raising belong to them. PPB said that medical devices can be obtained at the Pharmacy Board Kenya website. The board encouraged Kenyans to report to the PPB in case they come across any retailer selling related products.
