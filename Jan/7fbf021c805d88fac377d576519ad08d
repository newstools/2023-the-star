Mbosso has rescheduled his US tour that was cancelled last year over health issues. The 'Hodari' hitmaker now says he will be starting off his tour in Phoenix Arizona on February 10. "Washington Seattle Feb 17th Denver Colorado Feb 18th Kentucky February 25th Houston Texas," he wrote on Instagram. The 2022 tour was supposed to have gone down between the end of November to mid-December, but his doctor advised against it. "The doctor recommended that I should not travel or sit in a plane for more than eight hours," he announced. Mbosso said heÂ is suffering from severe heart problems. In an interview with Wasafi Media, he said the condition is caused by a blockage in his arteries and causes his body to tremble.
