President William Ruto’s interview was premature and reactionary, to defend his failures within the first 100 days, Vihiga Senator Godfrey Osotsi has said. He said during campaigns the Head of State promised Kenyans what he couldn't achieve. Osotsi said it's time Ruto talks of what he has achieved and not convert interviews into a campaign to defend what is not there. “President interviews are done to pronounce what they have achieved but not appear like they are in a campaign mood,” he said. “If the interview was designed to manage the dissatisfaction among Kenyans on the failure of Kenya Kwanza to implement the raft of 100 days promises in government, he failed miserably.” The lawmaker urged the Head of State to move on and implement what he promised Kenyans without asking for more time or generating other promises. “The President had promised to lower the cost of living, create jobs, to offer 50 per cent of his administration to women and to give jobs to Mama mboga and boda bodas but this has not been achieved,” he said. “The President further promised Sh50 billion to Kenyans for small business enterprises but he came up with a hustler fund where people are being given Sh500, Sh600 and Sh900. Which business will you run with that money.” Osotsi further said the Head of State had promised to empower local farmers to produce more food for Kenyans and not import GMO food. He said the President, since assuming office, has been pro-GMO than supporting farmers, a move that will leave Kenyan farmers with no capacity to produce. The senators remarks come after the Head of State while on National TV said they are importing GMO food to curb the shortage in the country.
