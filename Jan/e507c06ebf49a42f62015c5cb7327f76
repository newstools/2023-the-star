Kisumu AllStarlets have suffered a blow as dynamic midfielder Cynthia Akinyi faces a lengthy layoff with a knee injury sustained over the weekend. Akinyi was withdrawn against Gaspo Women, a match that ended 1-1 at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu on Sunday. In an exclusive interview, the all-action midfielder revealed her worst fears. "It was a dangerous tackle that caught my shin on the right leg unexpectedly but that is what we have to cope with as sportsmen and women. The initial diagnosis is that I might be out for six months but I hope to bounce back stronger," said Akinyi. "It was my first major injury. My season could be overÂ  but my fingers are crossed that I'll be able to play again this season." Kisumu coach Juma Said indicated on Sunday after the match that he expected the player to be out for two months. Akinyi has been a mainstay in the lakeside team since joining them in 2015 from Nyakach Girls High School. The 22-year-old, who had played every minute in the league this season prior to the injury, hopes to begin rehabilitation in June. "By June I should be able to return to light training but it all depends on the recovery process," she said. Meanwhile, the race for the golden boot award is already hotting up just six matches into the 2022/23 season WPL season. Maureen Achieng (Thika Queens) and Zetech Sparks' Puren Alekwe are joint top scorers with five goals. Elizabeth Muteshi ( Nakuru City Queens), Vihiga's Janet Moraa as well as Wendy Atieno (Thika), have three goals each. The duo of Melon Mulindi (Nakuru) and Anita Namata (Vihiga) boast of two goals apiece.
