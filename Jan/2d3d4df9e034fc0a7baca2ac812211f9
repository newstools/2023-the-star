Athletics Kenya President Jack Tuwei has thanked World Athletics for enacting new legislation to prevent athletes from switching allegiances without the country’s consent. The AK boss made the remarks at a meeting attended by World Athletics president Lord Sebastian Coe at a Nairobi hotel on Thursday. Several Kenyan athletes have switched allegiances to rival countries in major global competitions over the years. The East African athletics powerhouse has been a hunting ground for countries keen on tapping into its rich talent. Previously, athletes were not required to obtain permission from the government or federation before donning the colors of other nations. “Some of our athletes changed their nationalities without informing the federation. We filed an appeal and I’m glad World Athletics accepted it; we discussed it, and now we have new rules for 2023,” Tuwei said. However, with the new laws already in place, the scenario is bound to change drastically. “Athletes cannot change their nationality or allegiance in the future unless they first notify the federation and the government. This means similar incidents will not occur in the future. We want to thank WA for listening to us, and we hope that we will no longer meet athletes representing other countries without our permission,” he added. Kenyan athletes have recently been denied the traditional glory on the global stage by compatriots who have switched allegiance to other countries. The reasons behind the transfers vary but the biggest is the desire for wealth. Notable Kenyan athletes who have switched allegiance include Norah Jeruto, Lonah Salpeter, Bernard Lagat, and Winfred Mutile Yavi. At the 2022 Oregon Championships in Eugene, Kenyan athletes were denied by compatriots who have since switched flags. Jeruto bagged the 3000m steeplechase title for Kazakhstan while Salpeter clinched the marathon silver medal for Israel.
