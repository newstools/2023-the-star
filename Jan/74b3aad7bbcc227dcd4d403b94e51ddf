President William Ruto has said the government is committed to reviving the economy. Speaking at a prayer service to usher in the New year at State House, Mombasa, Ruto said the government will not shy away from making tough decisions aimed at sustainable economic growth. He revealed that the removal of subsidies on basic commodities saves the country over Sh25 billion per month. The President added that the government was also implementing a debt management plan to lessen the country's loan burden. "We are focused on investing in areas that will drive our economy forward sustainably," he said. "I am confident that we have laid a foundation that will take our economy away from dependence on debt to dependence on revenue that is raised locally." Ruto asked civil servants to be impartial in their delivery and serve all Kenyans equally irrespective of their political affiliations. "We are going to work together with all leaders, elected at all levels, to advance our development agenda," he said. Present during the service were First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto, Senate Speaker Amason Kingi, Governors Abdulswamad Shariff Nassir (Mombasa), Gideon Mung'aro (Kilifi) and Issa Timamy (Lamu). Others were Mining and Blue Economy CS Salim Mvurya and other MPs including Mohammed Ali of Nyali and other leaders.
