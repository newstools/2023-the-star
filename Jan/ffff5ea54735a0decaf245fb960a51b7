Former Roots Party presidential running-mate on August 9, 2022, presidential election Justina Wamae has said that she supports Jacaranda's rally if it will address Kenyan's concerns. In a statement on Sunday, Wamae said that Azimio leader Raila Odinga's rally should not lead to property damage. "I support today's rally if they address the high cost of living, high taxation, unemployment, uneven distribution of subsidized fertilizer, climate change, Covid and as long as they do not damage property, Kenyans are not in control of GoK," Wamae said. She said this ahead of Raila's planned rally at Jacaranda on Sunday. He told his supporters that they meet at the Jacaranda grounds for the rally dubbed "No Handshake". Despite the push from some leaders to cancel the rally, Raila on Saturday maintained the Jacaranda rally is still on. Religious leaders have expressed concern that the political rallies might jeopardize national peace, cohesion and security. Kwale County Religious Advisory Council Chair Sheikh Amani Mwachirumu said recent utterances by the ODM leader of failing to recognize President William Ruto and his administration are likely to divide Kenyans. "We are worried by Raila's words and if the said rally is to ever happen, it won't bring any good," he said. On Monday last week, Raila held a mega rally at Kamukunji Grounds immediately after returning from South Africa. The ODM leader said that victory was stolen from him, alleging that he was rigged out in the last general election
