Kamene Goro and her bae did not like each other before they became an item. Kamene said during her Kiss Breakfast show, she and DJ Bonez knew each other for almost six years but hardly spoke until two years ago. "I have known him for like five or six years. We did not like each other at all. We had mad beef, he used to say I am ratchet," she said. Kamene was celebrating two years in the relationship. "Some were criticising me for 'lying' to them about men yet I'm dating. I feel like people are just hallucinating. I always advocate for one thing, 'good love'." In a past Q and A segment, Kamene said she would never want to get kids out of wedlock.
