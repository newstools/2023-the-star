Tanasha Donna has filed copyright claims over a song in which she had been featured by Tanzanian singer Tommy Flavour. "This video is no longer available due to copyright claims by Tanasha Donna," reads the YouTube link to the collabo. Donna had said she was going to pull the video of their collabo 'Numero Uno' down over what she claimed was a low standard. She also alleged that the song was released by the distribution company without signing any documents. "How many of us artistes have spent money even way more than this on projects that we ended up not dropping because the project wasn't up to standard? So we jeopardise our brands 'cause the money was spent?" Tanasha added that she was working on terminating her contract with the company.
