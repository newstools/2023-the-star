Roots party leader and lawyer George Wajackoyah now says that he is alive today, because of the efforts of ODM leader Raila Odinga. Speaking at Kamukunji on Monday, Wajackoyah said that Raila and his long-time ally James Orengo saved his life when the then-Kanu regime came after him. Orengo is the current Siaya Governor. "I am here because of Raila. I live today because of Raila. If Raila was not there, I would not have had the opportunity to be alive today. Raila and James Orengo saved my life. Baba saved me wakati nilikuwa nauawa na ile serikali ya wakatili," he said. Wajackoyah added that it is Raila and then US Ambassador to Kenya, Smith Hempstone who worked to have him flown out of the country. He said it was during that time that Robert Ouko was murdered. "Baba na Balozi wa Marekani ule mtu alikuwa anaitwa Smith Hempstone took me from this country wakanipeleka ng√°mbo wakati wa mauaji ya Ouko." This loosely translates to, "It's Raila and a US ambassador who was called Smith Hempstone who took me abroad from this country".
