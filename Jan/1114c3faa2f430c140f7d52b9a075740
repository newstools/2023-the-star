Gukena FM presenter and comedian Wangari Nguri famously known as Auntie Jemimah has welcomed a newborn baby girl. "On this day one month ago, my rainbow baby girl arrived at 12: 10 pm. To say that I'm happy is an understatement because my heart is full!" she said. She said carrying a baby is one of the hardest journeys any woman could go through because one is constantly worrying, being extremely cautious, getting all sorts of unsolicited opinions and so much more. But it is rewarding in the end, she said. She said the arrival of her baby girl has come to heal her after she lost her child in 2021. "Hearing the cry of my little baby was all the healing I needed after pushing a still baby in 2021," she said. She urged fellow women to go for clinical checkups the moment they find out they are pregnant. Jemimah said she got Gestational Diabetes at 24 weeks urging fellow women to get all tests done in good time. "I will share this and more soon! For now, I just want to celebrate," she said. "So this my dear fans, family and friends is an encouragement to you who has lost, once or twice or severally, there’s hope! Trust the timing! Your reward might come immediately like mine did (I conceived 3 months after Makena) or it might take time." She urged women who have lost their children too to keep the faith, walk with their doctors, invest in a good medical facility, get insurance, and get therapy. "Meet My rainbow baby girl. Makeba! My Makeba!" she said.
