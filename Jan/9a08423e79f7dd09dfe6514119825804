A Narok court has convicted a fifty-year-old man after pleading guilty to marrying a nine-year-old girl in 2019 at Entasekera area in the Narok South subcounty. Mzee Saigilu Ololosereka, told the court that he was given the girl for marriage by the girl’s father. Narok children’s officer Pilot Khaemba told the court that the marriage was discovered after the minor, who is now 12, developed complications during delivery and had to be rushed to the Narok County Referral Hospital for treatment. The minor, who was accompanied by her elderly husband to the hospital, underwent a cesarean section but unfortunately experienced a stillbirth. The children's officer prayed to the court to grant his office permission to keep the young girl to Taraja Children’s home in Machakos Count once she is discharged from the hospital. Their prayer was granted by the court. Following the seriousness of the matter, the court clerk read out the charges to the old man in the Maasai language, cautioning him of the stern punishment that comes with the kind of offence he had committed. Surprisingly, Mzee Ololosereka reiterated that the charges were true and that the young girl was his wife whom he dearly protected. The state counsel prosecuting the case told the court that the elderly man was a first offender but reiterated the seriousness of the offence he had committed as it attracts life imprisonment. Court ruled that Mzee Saigilu will remain in police custody until January 11, 2023, when the judgment will be passed. The court also issued a warrant of arrest to the girl’s parents who had allegedly subjected the minor to early marriage.
