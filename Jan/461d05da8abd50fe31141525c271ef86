Azimio la Umoja leader Raila Odinga has asked President William Ruto to accept that he did not win the August 2022 presidential elections. Speaking during a church service at the Jesus Teaching Ministry in Donholm Raila said President Ruto should leave State House so that he can occupy. “Accept that you were defeated in the election, leave State House for Baba to get in. "We are speaking the truth, we do not want war, and we do not want threats. We have our rights as Kenyans, and it can not be snatched by a hawk, Kenyans deserve a leader that they elected,” he said. Raila also faulted President Ruto for high taxation in the country. Raila also laughed off reports that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations will probe his dossier on electoral fraud. The ODM boss said Mohamed Amin cannot investigate such a matter because he is President William Ruto's "employee". The DCI boss had written to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission over an alleged dossier by a whistle-blower detailing how Raila was cheated of victory. Raila rubbished Amin's move saying it is useless. "DCI has said he wants to investigate, I want to tell Amin that you are Ruto's employee, you can not do any investigation," Raila said.
