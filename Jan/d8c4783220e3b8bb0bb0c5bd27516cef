Police have launched investigations into the murder of a security guard at the National Housing Corporation (NHC) estate at Obunga in Kisumu. The deceased whom the police have not revealed his identity was attacked alongside his colleague by an unknown number of criminals. Kisumu Central Sub-county Police Commander Anthony Maina confirmed the incident saying the deceased succumbed to injuries. "We cannot reveal the names of the victims for security reasons," Maina said. He said that the other security guard was admitted in a serious condition but stable at a local hospital. "We woke up to a sad incident where a watchman was killed and another left in a critical condition in a gated estate," he said. Maina said the criminals who are suspected to have jumped over the perimeter wall broke into three vehicles and stole radio heads at the parking in the estate. The OCPD said they have investigations underway and they are making good progress. "We will not leave any stone unturned to ensure we bring the perpetrators to book," he added. Maina called on the public with vital information to share with police confidence to help fight crime in the midst.
