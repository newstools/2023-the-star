The National Olympic Committee of Kenya will launch the third edition of the Elite Youth Camp on Wednesday at the Merishaw school in Isinya after concluding the training for coaches who will handle the juniors. Thirty coaches will oversee the 10-day program after being equipped on how to better handle, train and manage budding athletes. The ambitious Elite Youth Development Program is for athletes aged between 12-18 years and is geared towards preparations for the various Youth Games scheduled for this year. The busy 2023 calendar includes Zone (V) Africa Youth Games in March in Ethiopia, Africa Youth Games in April in Congo Brazzaville and the Commonwealth Youth Games in August in Trinidad and Tobago. Elite Development Commission chairman Benjamin Musa emphasized the importance of providing guidance and technical support to the coaches handling the youth teams. “As a commission, we’ve planned appropriate training sessions and loads for the respective age group. The short-term plan is for the Camp while the long-term is the 2023 busy calendar. We want to align with the coaches' training plans and ensure our expertise in strength and conditioning, nutrition and science are at their disposal,” Musa said. Musa also explained that the Youth Camp was catered specially to ensure junior athletes' smooth transition into the senior cadre. “We lose many athletes to doping, low self-esteem and pressure to perform. We’re teaching the coaches how to bring athletes close and working closely with them without compromising growth. Not with the ‘winning at all cost’ mentality.” NOC-K 2022-2024 Strategic Plan envisions a deliberate effort towards a Youth Development Program and is tailored for the road to the Maiden Olympics to be held in Africa come Dakar 2026 Youth Olympic Games. Regina Gachora, President of Kenya Junior Golf and a member of the Elite Performance Commission as well as NOC-K deputy treasurer John Ogolla were present.
