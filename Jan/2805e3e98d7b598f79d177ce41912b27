Thomas Mbugua Muthee, the man charged with the murder of his girlfriend will today appear in court as his trial begins. Mbugua is accused of killing Naneu Muthoni, 31, in November 2022 at Onyonka estate within the Lang'ata sub-county in Nairobi. “That accused was last seen with the deceased at their rental house on the night of November 12 where it is alleged there was a confrontation between the two and all of a sudden everything went silent,” prosecutors told a court as they sought custodial orders. And after a 14-day detention to allow for the completion of investigations, Mbugua faced murder charges that he denied. He will today appear before Justice Daniel Ogembo where defence lawyers are likely to apply for bond. The court will also give directions on how the case will proceed. Mbugua was arrested at the Malaba border as he tried to escape into Uganda. Police officers who visited his house found the body of Muthoni covered in a bed sheet on the sofa with visible cut wounds on the head. Elsewhere at the magistrate's court, an ex-convict linked to the murder of a foreigner after a violent robbery on Ngong Road will be presented to court today after a two-week detention. Peter Waithaka alias Gikuyu was ordered detained for 14 working days by senior principal magistrate Bernard Ochoi to allow police complete investigations. Authorities claim Waithaka and his accomplices were involved during the robbery near Menelik Road off Ngong Road that left the foreigner with fatal injuries. He was shot in the chest. Waithaka was arrested in Makobgeni, Nairobi. Lead investigator Jacob Ndubda also told the court that when they went to the suspect's house, they found clothes that they believe he wore during the robbery as seen on CCTV.
