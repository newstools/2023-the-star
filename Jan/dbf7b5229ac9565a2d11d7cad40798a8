Nigerian singer Brymo has apologised over offensive tweets he made about the Igbo ethnic group in the country. Brymo, whose real name is Olawale Ashimi, had retweeted a Twitter post which referred to the Igbos, who hail from the south-east of the country, and are one of its largest ethnic groups, as “cowards”. He also wrote one post where he referred to the Igbo people using an offensive expletive and caused some anger when he said a president coming from the Igbo ethnic group is a “pipe dream”. In February's presidential election an Igbo candidate, Peter Obi, is gaining passionate support from many of Nigeria’s youth and on social media. On Monday morning he tweeted that he is "sorry" and did not mean to offend: "Forgive my assertions that came across as bigoted spewings against the Igbo tribe, I did not mean to do harm, I am sorry!!" Tens of thousands had signed a petition on Change.org to stop the singer from being on the nomination list at the All Africa Music Award (Afrima) for songwriter of the year, which took place this weekend. Online, people were furious with Brymo, calling his comments "racist" and "xenophobic". Brymo, who is from the Yoruba ethnic group, has told Nigerian media he is supporting Bola Ahmed Tinubu, another Yoruba man, in the the upcoming elections.
