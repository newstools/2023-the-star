President William Ruto on Sunday thanked the people of Laikipia for making him a grandfather. Speaking during an Interdenominational church service in Nanyuki Stadium, the President said his son Nick Ruto married from the county. He went on to say that following his wedding last year, Nick and his wife welcomed their first child. "Mwaka uliopita nililipa mahari na ninataka kuwashukuru watu wa Laikipia kwa sababu nyinyi mlimpatia kijana wangu bibi. Last year in January tulikuja hapa Laikipia tukalipa mahari na sasa tumebarikiwa nimepata mjukuu wa kutoka huku Laikipia," he said. This loosely translates to, "Last year, I paid dowry and I want to thank the people of Laikipia because you gave my son a wife. In January last year, we came to Laikipia, paid dowry and now we are blessed with a grandchild from here." Ruto further thanked the people of Laikipia saying that they are now blessed and moving forward with life. The Head of State joked that he had been told that in Laikipia dowry is not paid once, adding that he would continue visiting the county until he completes the process. He asked residents to always remind him of this obligation whenever he visits the region. "Na mimi naskia hapa kwenu mahari inalipwa kila siku, nitaendelea kuja kuja ndio nimalize hio kazi. Kwa hivyo mkiniona hapa msisahau, kabla sijaenda mnasema mambo ni namna gani." The President and other government officials have been in Laikipia for the past four days for a retreat as they plan on how to achieve his agenda for the country.
