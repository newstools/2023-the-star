There was no police presence during the Azimio la Umoja rally at the Kamukunji grounds on Monday. It was unclear yet as to why they had not been deployed or as to why they chose to stay away from the political rally attended by top leaders from the Alliance led by Raila Odinga. Unlike the previous rallies, Raila has had a contingent of armed police providing security to the leaders and the attendees. Normally, when a political wing or a group plans a demonstration, police are informed in advance so that they can authorize and deploy officers to maintain the law. A police chopper could only be seen making air surveillance in the area. When Raila made the declaration in December of the intention to embark on countrywide tours, President William Ruto gave him the green light and even directed cabinet secretary Kindiki Kithure to provide ample security as they demonstrate. "I have told Kindiki to ask the opposition people for their demonstrations' schedule so that we give them enough police officers to ensure they don’t loot from businesses,” Ruto said. Raila was then protesting the suspension of the four IEBC commissioners. During the rally, Raila told off President Ruto and his deputy president Rigathi Gachagua over what he termed as "empty threats" saying he cannot be cowed or threatened. "Ruto na huyo Gachagua wake, wacheni upuzi , Kenya si yenu," he said. Loosely translated to:  "Ruto and his deputy  Gachagua, stop the nonsense, Kenya is not yours". The ODM party leader called on Kenyans to stand with those whose elections were stolen in August 2022. He said he was ready to be taken to jail but he will continue to fight the Ruto's government. On Sunday, Ruto dared the opposition to lead demonstrations over the outcome of the August 9 General Election, terming it as a move financed by cartels opposed to reforms in the coffee, tea and milk sectors.
