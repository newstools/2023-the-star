Four people died on the spot following an accident involving a Nissan matatu shuttle and a cane trailer at Musembe area along the Eldoret-Webuye highway Sunday morning. Ten others were seriously wounded in the accident which occurred after the driver of the matatu which was travelling from Bungoma to Nairobi lost control and veered off the road before ramming into the stationary cane trailer from behind. The accident happened at around 5.45 am according to witnesses. The trailer is said to have packed along the road and was picking up casual labourers for the dayâ€™s work when the accident occurred. Three passengers of the matatu shuttle died on the spot while the fourth one succumbed as he was being rushed to hospital. The injured including the driver of the ill-fated matatu were rushed to the Lumakanda and Webuye hospitals in Bungoma and Kakamega counties respectively where they are currently admitted and receiving treatment. The four bodies have been moved to the Kimbilio Funeral Home in Lugari, Bungoma county. Witnesses have rebuked police officers who despite arriving early at the scene of accident, refused to rush the injured to hospital on grounds that they did not have fuel in their vehicle. The accident comes just a few months after eight people died at the same place after a matatu rammed into yet another stationary cane trailer in the area last year Locals are calling for the erection of more bumps in the area to reduce the growing loss of lives at the spot.
