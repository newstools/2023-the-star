Travellers using the Kisumu-Kakamega road had to wait for hours before proceeding with their journey after a pastor held prayers along the road. This saw traffic disruption on the road as Bishop Anthony Achesa of World Revival Gospel Ministry led the service. This forced those who were travelling to wait for the prayer session to end before they could proceed with their journey Reports indicate that the bishop has been conducting the prayers every December 31 for the past five years. Achesa who spoke after the service said the prayers have helped reduce accident incidents on the road but blamed the accidents on other factors such as drunk driving and unqualified drivers. "Traffic accidents cannot be purely blamed on witchcraft, witchcraft can be but there is an I don’t care attitude,” Achesa said. “Even as we were praying at Chavakali there are those who saw it like we were delaying them, that is the spirit of not caring. Also, people drive when drunk, then some are not qualified.” He called on motorists to exercise caution. The weekly data on road safety by the National Transport and Safety Authority released in December showed that the leading cause of road fatalities in the first half of December was losing control. Between December 5 and 13, 26 fatalities were recorded from vehicles that lost control while in transit. Some 12 fatalities were caused by drivers who failed to keep in the right lane and excessive speed was the fifth cause with 11 fatalities. Drivers that misjudged clearance caused six fatalities. According to the statistics pedestrians stepping, walking or running off a footpath into the road caused four fatalities. Pedestrians who crossed without due diligence at road junctions caused three fatalities. Brake failure, playing on the road, walking or standing on the road and crossing roads not marked by a stationary vehicle each caused two fatalities.
