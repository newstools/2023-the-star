The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has summoned Korogocho MCA Absalom Odhiambo over his utterances during Raila's Kamukunji rally. According to the commission, the ODM-elected MCA is expected to record a statement with NCIC. Recent political activity in the country has been causing unnecessary tension, which can in the long run throw the country into chaos. "A case in point is the utterances by Korogocho Member of County Assembly Absalom Odhiambo Onyango at the Azimio la Umoja Alliance rally at the Kamukunji grounds on Monday 23, January 2023 which inter alia invoked ethnic hatred while inciting Kenyans to violence," NCIC chairman Samuel Kobia. The chairman said the commission would not allow anyone to undermine the presidency because it is a symbol of national unity. NCIC said the president should be accorded respect and honour all the time. "Any action that undermines the presidency will not only damage national cohesion but will also injure peace and unity among Kenyans," he said. Speaking during the rally, Odhiambo used unprintable words to refer to President William Ruto and his deputy Rigathi Gachagua. "...Kwa siasa ya taifa tunataka tutoke twende ikulu tutoe huyo mwizi... Nataka tuingie town, tufunge biashara. Hakuna biashara itaendelea hii town ya Nairobi. Ndio William Ruto aheshimu Raila Odinga lazima tufunge biashara hii town," he said. This loosely translates to, "For national politics, let us go to State House and remove that thief... I want us to go to town and close businesses. No business will be conducted in Nairobi. For William Ruto to respect Raila Odinga we must close businesses in this town."
