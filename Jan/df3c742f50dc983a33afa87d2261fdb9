Kenya Methodist University dean of students Esther Mbaabu has stated a list of what would be considered inappropriate dressing at the varsity. In the memo dated January 5, 2023, Mbaabu said all students are required to comply with the University code of dressing. "All students are required to wear appropriate attire during study, at meal times in the dining hall, and in all university functions," she said. Female students are expected to leave their tumbo cuts (tops that expose their belly and naval) at home. Other prohibited dressing codes are bare backs (exposing their backs), miniskirts (any skirt above the knee line) and a skirt whose slit is above the knee line. Dresses and blouse with necklines running down more than 4 inches, body-tight trousers, and see-through clothes are also prohibited. The male students who will also show up at the university with plaited hair, and earrings will not be spared. Mbaabu says male students with dreadlocks, untucked shirts, vests that show bare chests and hats/caps will be considered as having dressed inappropriately.
