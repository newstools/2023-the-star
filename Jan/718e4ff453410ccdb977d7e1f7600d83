UDA chairman Johnson Muthama is in mourning following the death of his Chief Security officer, Nicholas Musilu. “No words can express how sad I am for the loss of my Chief Security officer, Mr Nicholas Musilu, based in Rockland Ltd Mines in Tsavo West National Park,” Muthama said. He eulogized Musilu as a dedicated officer who loved his family and he will be dearly missed by the community. “Therefore, I wish to convey my sincerest condolences to his wife and children at this difficult moment. I pray to God to grant them love and comfort and may his soul rest in eternal peace,” Muthama said. At the same time, he condoled the family of CS Trade Moses Kuria (CS, Trade) for the loss of his Sister Pauline Nyokabi who passed on while receiving treatment at Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital last week. "May the entire family find solace in the Almighty God during this trying moment and may her soul rest in eternal peace," he said.
