Chief Justice Martha Koome on Monday held a joint meeting with the Principal secretaries for Correctional Services and Social Protection. The meeting with PSs Mary Muthoni Muriuki and her counterpart Joseph Motari aimed to discuss issues of mutual interest. "We agreed on the need for the Judiciary and the two departments to collaborate on diverting children and the elderly from the prison system," Koome said. The CJ further said the Judiciary has institutionalised Childrenâ€™s Service Weeks to address the backlog of cases affecting children. She said the 2022 November Service Month culminated in the resolution of 1,825 cases. "There is also a worrying concern regarding congestion in correctional centres and borstal institutions, creating an urgent need to review sentences, for decongestion of prisons," Koome said. To resolve this state of affairs, Koome said the Judiciary has embarked on use of non-custodial sentences in non-serious offences. This includes affordable fines, discharges, reconciliations, probation and community service.
