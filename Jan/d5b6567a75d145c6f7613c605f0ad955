Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has dismissed reports that he is engaged in a silent war with Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. Mudavadi termed the claims, which have been featured in the media lately as an imagination in the wrong direction. “Do you see any injuries on me? Do you see any scars? Do I look like someone who has been fighting,” he posed. Mudavadi said he sees his role as complementary to the work of President William Ruto and Rigathi. “I have been in government long enough to understand that infighting sabotages the work of an administration. We need to work as a team to fulfil our pledges to Kenyans,” he added. Mudavadi said any differences between the DP and him would be addressed internally through dialogue. “In case of any problem, we will have mediation and talk dialogue internally. As far as I am concerned, I am supposed to be assisting the President and Deputy President,” he said. The Prime Cabinet Secretary further dismissed reports that some of his roles are similar to those of the Deputy President. “My roles are clear and they are very different,” he said. Amani National Congress party has also refuted claims that Prime Cabinet Secretary and Deputy President are in a ‘cold war”. Addressing the media on Tuesday, ANC deputy party leader Margaret Ntokai termed the cold war reports as petty politics saying the two are in good rapport. “I want to disagree and to refute claims that Mudavadi and Gachagua are at loggerheads,” she said. “I don't think that the DP and Prime secretary Cabinet can engage in any kind of war because they want the government to succeed in its agenda.” Gachagua and Mudavadi hold the second and third most influential positions in government, respectively. Azimio spokesperson Makau Mutua has claimed that Ruto wants  Mudavadi to surpass his Deputy. Mutua claimed that Ruto wants Mudavadi at the top by making Gachagua ineffective.
