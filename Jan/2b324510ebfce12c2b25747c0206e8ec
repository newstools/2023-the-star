Girls in Garissa have a reason to smile after Defence CS Adan Duale commissioned an ultra-modern school in the county. The Young Muslim Girls' Secondary School is expected to admit its first batch of students next month of February. Speaking during the official opening of the school on Saturday, Duale acknowledged the challenges that have continued to affect the North Eastern region such as insecurity and shortage of teachers. He however noted that the region will benefit from the more than 30,000 teachers to be hired this year by the Teachers Service Commission. “The government is addressing teacher shortage by recruiting over 30,000 teachers this year and NEP will have its share,” Duale said. “Education for empowerment, especially of the girl child, will improve education standards and access in the North Eastern Region from many of its present challenges including the teachers' shortage and insecurity in most rural parts,” he noted. According to the CS, the new school which will be of great benefit to the community joins other learning institutions established by the YMA. These include Young Muslim Academy, Young Muslim Orphanage Centre, Young Muslim Boys' Secondary School and Al Basir School for the Visually Impaired. TSC has recently put in a raft of measures to address the teachers shortage in schools in Northeastern and ensure learners in the region get quality education. The measures the government has put in place including that of lowering the entry grade for colleges and universities for local students pursuing education courses. Some non-local teachers have in the recent years fled the region due to insecurity caused by al Shabaab militants.
