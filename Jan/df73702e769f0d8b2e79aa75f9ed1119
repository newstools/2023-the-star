Zari Hassan has raised questions about her relationship with her Ugandan bae, Shakib. On her Snapchat account, she shared a quote by Horacio Jones, speaking about trust issues that affect a relationship when a partner lies. "Some people do not understand how poisonous lies are," she said. "Lies infect and curse happy relationships to the point where you actually feel sick to your stomach for trusting them again." She said lying causes permanent problems in the relationship as the partner who was lied to can never be sure about what their partner is saying. "No matter how much you love a person, sometimes you can't help but feel like they stole your comfort," she said. "You're no longer comfortable because you second-guess everything."
