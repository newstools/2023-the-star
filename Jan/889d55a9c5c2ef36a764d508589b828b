Kisumu All-Starlets right-back Catherine Odongo is keeping her fingers crossed that she won't suffer a setback in her recovery journey from a career-threatening knee injury that has kept her out for six months. The enterprising player, who fractured the tibia and fibula bones in her right leg in a pre-season friendly match in July last year, has begun rehabilitation. "I am happy to start my recovery back to full fitness. It was so bad that I personally did not see myself playing again but the doctor told me I'll be able to get back into action." Odongo joined the lakeside club in 2016 and remains one of their most experienced players. The attacking-minded defender is targeting a comeback in April. "I am in no hurry to return. I will only do so when my body feels ready. Probably, I hope to start competing again inÂ  April," said Odongo. In 2018, Odongo suffered a knee injury that kept her on the sidelines for three months. In early 2022, she was again out with a neck problem that put her on the treatment table for one month. The soft-spoken player was on the stands as Kisumu lost 2-1 to Ulinzi Starlets at Ulinzi Sports Complex on Sunday in a hard-to-take defeat for the all-action athlete. "I feel bad that I can't help as my team continues to drop points. I really miss playing. For now, I can't predict what the future holds for me but a lot will depend on my recovery." Odongo also tipped her replacement Vivian Nancy to hit the ground running saying: "She has the attributes to become the best in the position. She just needs to work hard."
