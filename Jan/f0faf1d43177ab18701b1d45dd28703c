Nairobi City Stars chief executive officer Patrick Korir is confident the team will rediscover their winning ways despite remaining winless in eight FKF Premier League games. "We have had a rough start to the season despite having had a more or less good but extended preseason," said Korir in a terse statement on Wednesday. He added: "We have extensively discussed as a unit —players, technical bench and management—with a view of arresting the unacceptable results. We are resetting our focus and mindset, and sooner than later we will turn things around." In their last game, City Stars succumbed to a 4-2 loss against fellow strugglers Vihiga Bullets at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega County. The club lost their sixth game of the season despite welcoming midfielders Peter Opiyo and Oliver Maloba, as well as stopper Kennedy Onyango from injury. It was Vihiga Bullets' first win of the season under coach George Owoko. During the game, Bullets led the tie 2-0 at halftime with a brace from Vincent Ogola. He added one more in the second half to complete his hat trick before his team crowned it with a fourth goal from Enock Masinza to lead 4-0. Samuel Kapen then powered home a header off an Anthony Kimani free-kick before finishing off a cross from Ezekiel Odera on the left at close range to end the match at 4-2. The Jonathan Jackson Foundation-sponsored club is currently languishing in the 16th position with a paltry two points having shipped 15 goals— the highest in the league so far. Simba Wa Nairobi will hope to arrest their worrying form when they face eighth-placed Sofapaka at the Moi International Sports Center, Kasarani on Saturday from 1 pm. In August last year, the club parted ways with 12 senior players and signed 10 rookies. Most of the new players were signed from lower-tier teams as the club changed its strategy from signing already established players.
