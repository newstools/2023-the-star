The Independent Policing Oversight Authority has begun investigations into alleged police brutality in Borabu, Nyamira county. This is after a 23-year-old man identified as Franklin Mong’are succumbed to injuries that were allegedly inflicted by two administration police officers and a local chief at the Kiang'eni chief's camp. County police commander James Mitugo has since said investigations into the matter have commenced and they will cooperate with Ipoa in its inquiry. "We will ensure those culpable are brought to book. Whenever such allegations arise, it is Ipoa that comes in to investigate," Mitugo said in his office on Monday. The deceased is alleged to have been clobbered by the uniformed officers when he went to seek the release of his motorbike which had been impounded last week. The operator died a few days later while receiving treatment at Tenwek Hospital in Bomet county. He had been rushed there by his relatives after he complained of head and chest pains. According to a trader who witnessed the incident, the local administrator is said to have handed the deceased to the officers stationed at his office after he lamented that he was being locked up in custody for no reason. The chief has since distanced himself from Mong’are’s death saying that he only arrested him with the illicit brew he was ferrying. Mong'are's relatives have urged the authorities to speed up investigations so that their son can get justice. They have also called for the arrest of the chief and the officers. The motorcyclist leaves behind a widow and a baby who is barely 5 months.
