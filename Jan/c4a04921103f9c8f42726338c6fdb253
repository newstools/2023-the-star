Former Harambee Stars striker Dennis Oliech wants former footballers to be involved in president William Ruto’s botton-up tournaments to help develop the game in the country. The former AJ Auxerre striker says football must be managed by individuals who understand the game, especially former players. Speaking during a Kenya Football Stakeholders Forum meeting, Oliech said he is unhappy with the state of the game in the country and only fresh elections in putting individual who are the game to help. “Elections need to be done so that people who know football can run the game. Former national team players need to take up roles with junior national teams like under-14 and U-16s. They should also be involved in the forthcoming county tournaments. KFSF consist of football stakeholders including club officials, former administrators and retired football players. The Forum was, however, happy with how fast Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba moved in to have Kenya’s Fifa ban lifted. “We would like to thank Namwamba for his quick intervention upon being appointed to prevail upon the world football governing body, Fifa to lift the ban imposed on the country last year. We all know the effects the ban brought with it,” they said in a statement. “Football has been in bad state for the past years. The current leadership has failed the country and has no business of being at the helm.” It went on: “Fifa leadership is set to visit Kenya from January 9 and, as stakeholders, we are eagerly waiting to see the outcome of the mission. Kenyan football needs a total overhaul in management structures.” Among the measures KFSF proposed to be undertaken with immediate effect includes formation of normalisation committee to undertake the first step of resuscitating football as previously done by similar missions by Fifa. They also want Fifa to conduct forensic audit of funds they have been disbursing to FKF for the last four years.
