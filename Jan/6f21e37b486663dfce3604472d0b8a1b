Team Kenya junior players have set sights on the African championships slated for later this year after dominating the Eastern Zonal category in Bujumbura, Burundi. Following the wins in the under-14 and under-16 individual categories, Seline Ahoya and Melisaa Mwakha continued their rich vein of form in the team event, winning both titles. Ahoya teamed with Nancy Kawira to win the under-14 categories as Mwakha and Mercyline Oresha took top honours in under-16 category. Ayush Bhandari and Baraka Ominde settled for bronze in the boys' 16 and under category. Coach Rosemary Owino said preparations for the African event will start as soon as possible. "The boys and girls have done well in the various categories and we are delighted with the win. There is hunger and desire to do well in the continental event,” said Owino. The coach said the win in Bujumbura highlights the rich depth the country has in both the boys and girls' categories. "I believe we have a good crop of players coming through and the future of Kenyan tennis looks bright," said Owino. Ahoya said she will be going all out at the continental championships. "I'm delighted to have done the country proud in Burundi. I will now go back to training and work harder and prepare for the Africa championships later in the year,” added Ahoya. The teenager said she has taken inspiration from Wimbledon doubles junior champion Angela Okutoyi's rise. "She has really encouraged me and I hope to glow in her exploits in the years to come,” she said. Team Kenya bagged the overall crown with 1200 points with hosts Burundi coming second with 1040 points. Uganda were third with 710 points with Tanzania fourth with 450. Rwanda were bottom with 395 points. Kenya scooped gold medals in the boys and girls' U-14, silver medal in girls' U-16 and bronze medal in boys' U-16.
