Scientists have warned that there will be a return of the El Niño phenomenon later in 2023. According to scientists, it will cause a rise in global temperatures and unprecedented heat waves. Guardian stated that early forecasts suggest that the El Niño climate will make the world likely to exceed 1.5C of warming. 2023 is expected to be hotter than 2022. It has been ranked as the fifth or sixth hottest year on record. El Niño occurs during the northern hemisphere winter and its heating effect takes months to be felt, therefore, 2024 is much more likely to set a new global temperature record. The head of the long-range prediction at the UK Met Office, Adam Scaife, said that it is likely the next big El Niño could take the world over 1.5C. "The probability of having the first year at 1.5C in the next five-year period is now about 50:50," he said. "We know that under climate change, the impacts of El Niño events are going to get stronger, and you have to add that to the effects of climate change itself, which is growing all the time. You put those two things together, and we are likely to see unprecedented heatwaves during the next El Niño." Scaife said the fluctuating impacts of the El Niño-La Niña cycle could be seen in many regions of the world. "Science can now tell us when these things are coming months ahead. So we really do need to use it and be more prepared, from having readiness of emergency services right down to what crops to plant," he said.
