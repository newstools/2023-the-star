Senate Speaker Amason Kingi has recalled Senators for a special sitting on Thursday. In a gazette notice on Wednesday, the speaker said the lawmakers will consider the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2022. The Bill seeks to change the composition of the IEBC selection panel. The panel will conduct the recruitment of IEBC commissioners. "The sittings shall be held at the Senate Chamber, Main Parliament Buildings, Nairobi as follows— (a) morning sitting — 10.00 am to 12.30 p.m. and(b) afternoon sitting — 2.30 p.m. until the conclusion of the business of the day," the gazette notice reads. Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi and Majority leader Aaron Cheruiyot confirmed the senators had been recalled to approve the Bill before the President declares the vacancy. “Yes, we intend to conclude on it as it is urgent. IEBC lacks commissioners, therefore, there is a need to set up a selection panel,” Cheruiyot told the Star on Tuesday. The Bill was introduced in the Senate for its First Reading last month following its passage in the National Assembly. Senate’s Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, which has been conducting public participation on the Bill, will table its report to inform the debate. Section 7A (2) provides that the President shall declare a vacancy in the commission within seven days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the chairperson or a member of the commission. The Bill enables the Political Parties Liason Committee and Public Service Commission to nominate a member each to the panel. If it sails through, the bill will enable the Political Parties Liaison Committee, established under section 38 of the Political Parties Act, No. 11 of 2011 and the Public Service Commission to nominate one member to the panel.
