There are many solutions to rampant alcoholism that has affected many people in the country. Unfortunately, reducing the number of bars is not a viable solution. DP Rigathi Gachagua has recently been on the forefront in fighting alcoholism in Central Kenya. He has insisted each town should have a single bar. Gachagua believes that alcoholism is caused by the high number of bars in any region. It is as if people become alcoholics largely because they can readily access alcohol. There are deeper social and economic problems that make people resort to alcoholism. I don't think there is a single person who wakes up to devote his or her life to alcohol. It could be unemployment or anything. As such, closing bars will only increase the number of illegal joints that will cater for those who will not afford to go to that one bar. What Gachagua has completely ignored is the inventiveness and ingenuity of both the sellers and consumers of alcohol. The number of sellers may reduce, but the consumers will remain the same. People will still drink no matter the situation. Mututho laws have not worked and this new directive will not work either until underlying issues are solved. Although there are those who have given up on themselves, there are many others who drink because there are no opportunities for personal and social growth. They are hopeless. Even as Gachagua tries to save a generation, he needs to find out why people drink in the manner they do. Is it because there is nothing better to do? Is it a lack of opportunities? It could be many things and access to alcohol might not rank that high. Even if alcohol is banned, someone will always find a way to supply it. Kipchirchir Rop, Nairobi.
