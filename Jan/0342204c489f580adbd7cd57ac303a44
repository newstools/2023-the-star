The Kenya Karate Federation-KKF is set to establish Karate academies in learning institutions across the Western region. The body is currently seeking to partner with primary, and secondary schools and also universities and colleges in the region. The move is meant to help nature kids with Karate talent from a young age to enable them to make the most out of a career in the sport. According to the western region federation secretary general Christopher Ouma, the body will nurture talent by hosting numerous competitions between these institutions, once the move to establish the academies pulls through. Already, the federation has set up karate academies in Musingu and Ebukambuli secondary schools and also at the Sigalagala National Polytechnic. Ouma spoke at the Inter-University Karate and Taekwondo Championships for the Western Conference which brought together 10 Universities in the preliminaries for the National Playoffs for indoor games set to happen at Meru University on February 25 this year. During the championships, Rongo University took the first position followed by Maseno University in second and MMUST took the third position. According to Akaka Shisoka who is the chairperson of the Kenya University Sports Association Western Conference, the championships are strictly tailored in line with guidelines from the International University Sports Federation-FISU. “We are hoping to do all level best at the national playoffs at Meru University in February. We are equally seriously planning and practising for the East Africa games and the Africa Inter-University games and the International Inter-University games. We intend to win them all, “he said.
