Maasai morans held a Maasai rite of passage dubbed Emuratta Eunooto ceremony on January 8, 2023. During the rite of passage, the morans transit from boys to men. The ceremony was held in honour of the Ilkileu age group at Osinoni village in Kilgoris, Narok county. Emuratta symbolises circumcision while Eunoto is a warrior-shaving ceremony. The circumcision ceremony is the most vital initiation of all rites of passage in the Maasai society. This initiation is performed shortly after puberty. CircumcisionÂ initiation elevates an individual from childhood to adulthood. In order for the boy to be initiated he must prove himself to the community. The boy must exhibit signs of a grown man, by carrying a heavy spear and herding a large herd of livestock.
