Turkana county has surpassed the measles vaccination target. The county in collaboration with the national government and partners vaccinated 151,364 children against Measles-Rubella (MR) in the just concluded countywide ten days vaccination campaign. The campaign started on December 9-18, 2022, was targeting 146,129 children between the ages of nine months to five years. The supplementary immunisation activity comes after 13 confirmed cases were reported in Kakuma Camp, mid this year. County health teams and stakeholders were commended for surpassing the set national target of 95 per cent in the MR Vaccination Campaign. “The County achieved a target of 103.6 % which is slightly above the set target because of vaccinating new arrivals in the Reception Centre in the Refugee Camp,” an official said during the campaign’s review meeting. He appreciated the caregivers for ensuring that their children were brought to the vaccination posts and with no cases of vaccine hesitancy. According to Gabriel Lopodo the head of the Family Health Division, the county has already conducted a cold-chain needs assessment and was currently resource mobilising. He said an efficient vaccine cold-chain system ensures that all health facilities are immunising. Luke Erot, Communication for Development officer at Unicef Kenya (Lodwar Office), appreciated the Health ministry’s leadership and support provided during the exercise. Gregory Waikwa, International Rescue Committee (IRC) Core Group Partners Manager, said the organisation was committed to collaborating with the ministry to enhance high routine immunisation and cross-border surveillance as strategies for MR elimination. Partners that supported the campaign include UNOPS, Ministry of Health, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNHCR Kenya, World Health Organization-Kenya, Save the Children, Diocese of Lodwar, PanAfricare Kenya, USAID Imarisha Jamii, USAIDNawiri and World Vision Kenya.
