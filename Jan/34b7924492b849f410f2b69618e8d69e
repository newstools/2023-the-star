Nyeri Senator Wahome Wamatinga has warned Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja of impeachment if he continues "joking". "We want to say Rigathi Gachagua is not your equal. If you continue joking, we will impeach you," he said. This is in connection with a disagreement between Sakaja and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on how to run the county. On December 20, 2022, Gachagua warned Sakaja against implementing his plan to relocate matatus from the CBD to GreenPark Terminus. He termed the move as ill-intentioned which he claimed was aimed at persecuting the business community from Mt Kenya, adding that will disrupt businesses. "I shall sit down with Sakaja because we are the ones who elected him. We must first discuss anything which can disrupt business in Nairobi. We do not need a lot of speed, go slow," the DP said. Weighing in on the issue while addressing mourners at Mathira constituency, Wamatinga reiterated the DP's statement. He said if Sakaja failed to show respect to Gachagua, the Kikuyus were going to deal with him. "Rigathi made you the governor. Don't play with the Kikuyu community. We will not relent," he said.
