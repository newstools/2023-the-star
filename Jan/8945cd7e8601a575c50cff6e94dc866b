A contractor at National Youth Service (NYS) Engineering Institute in Ruaraka abandoned the site after receiving Sh186.2 million, a report of Auditor-General Nancy Gatungu shows. The report for the period ended June 30, 2021, said the amount was equivalent to 90 per cent of the contract sum. It said the contract for the construction of a kitchen and dining was awarded in May 2011 at a sum of Sh192 million. It added that the project commenced on 13 June 2011 with a contract duration of 80 weeks. “The contractor was granted an extension period of up to 13 March 2017. The contractor however abandoned the site after receiving payments totalling Sh186,248,573 or 90 per cent of the agreed contract sum,” Gathungu said. She added that a physical inspection of the project in May 2022 revealed that work had stalled and the contractor had abandoned the site. “Further, huge visible cracks on the wall and floor were noted which continue to deteriorate. The management claimed that the delay in completion was mainly due to delayed payments to the main contractor and sub-contractors,” Gathungu said. The Auditor-General added that value for money has not been realised 11 years after construction commenced. She further added that another project to put up a classroom block and workshop in Ruaraka has also stalled for 11 years. She said the project stalled despite NYS having paid Sh81.8 million for the works, an equivalent of 92 per cent of the contract sum. Gathungu noted that NYS entered into a contract for the project on 13 April 2011 at a contract sum of Sh88.7 million. “The project was to take 52 weeks ending on 9 June 2012. This was later extended by 31 weeks and was expected to have been completed by 12 January 2013. However, the construction stalled in 2017 after payment of Sh81,884,550 equivalent to 92 per cent of the contract sum against 95 per cent of the works certified,” she said. Gathungu further added that a physical inspection conducted in May 2022 revealed that no construction works were ongoing as the contractor had abandoned the site.
