First Lady Rachael Ruto sponsored a football tournament over the weekend aimed at nurturing talent among children. Children aged between 5 years and below, 8-10 years and 12-17 participated in the event held at State House grounds. Some 200 boys and girls drawn from Nairobi and other parts of the country took part in the Back to the Basics Football Clinic. Event manager George Agatho thanked the First Lady, who is the patron of the event, for bringing together kids for a sporting event saying it will go a long way in nurturing talents. “I want to thank the First Lady for giving us the opportunity to mentor our kids as far as sports is concerned. The country will reap big in such event in the future because talents for the national teams will be spotted here,” he said. During the tournament, State House Academy registered a 2-1 victory over Atlas Soccer Club. During the event, participants were enlightened with the newest skills and rules in the ever-changing world of football. "So this is a welcoming brief to all the parents to join our Soccer academy which hopefully will be replicated throughout all the regions in Kenya," he said. Kennedy Walusala, who was part of the technical bench, urged parents and education stakeholders to encourage children to participate in sporting activities. “We are looking forward to investing in our kids and making everything easier as we focus on all areas of child growth and development,” he said.
