Kisumu county government has issued a notice to all traders with stalls at the Uhuru Business Park to report to the City Trade registration desk where the process of allocation will be verified and finalised. This will be done at the Mama Grace Onyango Social and Cultural Centre on January 23 from 6 am. The city management is in the process of mass resettlement of traders from Nyamlori, Apindi streets, Garissa Lodge, and Winam Booksellers at Uhuru Business Market Complex. City manager Abala Wanga said the process of verification will bring sanity and ensure fairness in the relocation process. Wanga said they have also set up a complaint desk that will address all the genuine grievances of dissatisfied traders. "Take further notice that double registration of stalls is prohibited. The selling or renting out of stalls is also prohibited," read the notice dated January 20, 2023. The city manager said priority shall be given to traders from Nyamlori, Apindi streets, Garissa Lodge, and Winam Booksellers. "Traders allocated stalls at the shade are kindly requested to take them up within seven days of the date of this notice failure to which, the allocations shall be considered cancelled," he said. He said to ensure fairness in the resettlement action plan, all letters of allotment that were previously issued by the office of the city manager are hereby revoked and recalled effective immediately. "Sheds J, K and L at the market should remain vacant. Any trader with an allotment letter of the same should consider it revoked. The said traders are to avail themselves for the verification exercise," Wanga said.
