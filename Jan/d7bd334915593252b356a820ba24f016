ODM Chairman John Mbadi has disclosed that Nyanza leaders declined to meet President William Ruto in Nairobi ahead of his tour last week. Speaking on Monday, Mbadi said the officials met Interior PS Raymond Omollo and made the preparation ahead of the president's tour. He said the President invited leaders from the region and they obliged. "A change of heart from where... I don't think there's a change of heart. This is the first time Ruto is making an official visit to Nyanza as a president and he invited leaders from the region he was visiting," Mbadi told Spice FM. "I was invited to the functions in Homa Bay. We made preparatory meetings here in Nairobi together with PS Interior. "I led the MPs from Homa Bay. We met with him (PS Omollo) and we were to meet the President here in Nairobi but we politely requested that we meet in Homa Bay and that was granted. We asked for one hour, we were given two." Mbadi, who is a nominated MP, said the meeting was largely based on the development of Homa Bay County. "We presented a memorandum through our governor and I think the same was replicated in other counties," he stated. Last week, President William Ruto toured Homa Bay, Kisumu and Siaya counties where he launched development projects. He further outlined his plan for the region and the country, saying that he will work for all regards of those who voted for him and who did not. The President also vowed to work with all elected leaders to better the lives of Kenyans. The Nyanza region is a stronghold of Opposition leader Raila Odinga.
