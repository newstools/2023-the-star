Egerton University lecturers have threatened to go on strike. This follows the institution's decision last December to issue notices to lay off staff. Through their Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU) Egerton branch, the dons said they will don tools of the university does not reverse the plans. UASU Egerton Secretary  Grace Kibue and Chairman professor Mwaniki Ngare said the plans are ill-timed and unfortunate at a time when the university is struggling. “The notice has come at a time when most of the lecturers have gone for greener pastures and most of them have been working for two years and they are surviving on half pay, it is terrible,” said Kibue. Mwaniki, on his part, said that the institution has heavily mistreated its employees and turned them into the "laughing stock of society". “We have an employer who has injured workers and continues to injure workers, it’s unfortunate and we can’t allow this challenge to continue again,” he stated. The officials called on the government to steps to bring a new team of management to the university to help turn around the systems and help it to remain afloat. The university has been facing deep financial woes that saw a court convict some of its top leadership over failure to obey orders to pay staff their salaries.
