The head of the 71-year-old woman who was killed at her house in Escarpment village in Lari, Kiambu has been found. Leah Mwihaki's head was found wrapped in a polythene paper bag and stashed in a sawdust bag in a building that is under construction. It was discovered by the contractor and his workers when they went to the site. "The construction work had stopped. The contractor came in the morning with his workers and started working" chief Karanja Nduati said. "While they were there, they pulled a bag which had saw dust and noticed a polythene paper bag and checked. They saw blood and it was heavy, they called me." Nduati called the police and detectives led by Lari DCI Eunice Maingi. Lari MP Mburu Kahangara urged anyone with information that may help the police to know the motive of the murder to alert them. "We are not taking this issue lightly. We need thorough investigations and we must help our officers where we can" the legislator said. "The DCI officers are trained and they cannot disclose intelligence information we have regarding this case. If you will find it difficult to tell them, just inform me and I will share with them." The head was taken to Uphome funeral home where the rest of the body was taken. One suspect has been arrested by the DCI officers.
