Opposition leader Raila Odinga has now claimed that National Assembly speaker Moses Wetang'ula, former IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and Justice Aggrey Muchelule are brothers in-law. Speaking on Sunday during the Jacaranda rally, Raila said that they are all married from the same home. "Bwana Chebukati na Muchelule ni mwanyumba. Yaani bibi zao ni dada na mke wa Wetang'ula ametoka hapo hapo.(Mr Chebukati and Muchelule are in-laws. Their  wives are sisters and Wetang'ula's wife too) ...Wetang'ula, Chebukati and Muchelule are brothers in-law," he said. "One stole elections, another is a Judge and the other is National Assembly speaker." Raila was reacting to the ongoing probe into what happened ahead of the announcement of the August 2022 presidential election. A tribunal formed to investigate IEBC rebel commissioners was picked by President William Ruto. The Tribunal is led by Justice Muchelule and has so far investigated Commissioner Irene Masit. The other three, former vice chair Juliana Cherera, Francis Wanderi and Justus Nyangaya resigned. Ruto also appointed Carolyne Kamende Daudi, Linda Gakii Kiome, Mathew Njaramba Nyabena, Col. (Rtd.) Saeed Khamis Saeed as members of the tribunal. Kibet Kirui Emmanuel, Irene Tunta Nchoe have been appointed joint secretaries. The tribunal's lead counsel will be Peter Munge Murage who will be assisted by Zamzam Abdi Abib.
