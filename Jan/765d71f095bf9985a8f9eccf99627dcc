Residents in Kisumu county have been urged to register for subsidised fertiliser before the deadline. Kisumu county commissioner Josephine Ouko said farmers must be ready for the long rains by being enlisted for fertilisers. Ouko said the government subsidy on fertilisers makes it cheaper and will give farmers better returns. “You know that what the government is offering is cheaper, take this opportunity before the rains begin”, she said. The commissioner said no farmer should be left behind. Speaking in Kisumu during a security meeting in Nyamasaria, Ouko said the registration is being done by the assistant chiefs. She said the registration process will end by January 17 and any farmer who shall not be registered will be locked out from the subsidy. Ouko said food production in the country will be scaled up by farmers who are actively engaged in farming. “Walk into a store, fertiliser is being sold at around Sh7,000 but the government is offering cheaper prices, to give farmers that opportunity to plant more,” she said. Ouko said it is through farming that most young people will be engaged as opposed to the crime that has soared in the area in the recent past. President William Ruto said his administration imported 1.5 million bags of fertiliser immediately after it came into office and an additional 200,000 metric tons of fertilisers arrived in the country. The cost of each bag was reduced from Sh6000 to 3500. While expressing confidence that the country will soon be food secure, the President said they will supply 6 million bags of subsidised fertilizers to farmers.
