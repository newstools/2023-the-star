KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has assured its customers that flights on the Nairobi route are stable. While apologising to the government for the damage from an earlier alert, the airline pointed out that “flights in and out of Nairobi remain as per schedule and no interruptions are anticipated.” The carrier had erroneously said that civil unrest between Friday and Monday could potentially force flights to be canceled. After an uproar, however, it amended its alert to refer to an unspecified local threat in Tanzania. “The said alert, which was only meant for our customers in Tanzania, was inadvertently and erroneously also shared with our customers in Kenya. We made a mistake in our rebook policy and initially included Kenya. This is incorrect and we would like to apologize for this,” the airline said. The airline, which is owned by Air France-KLM, issued a cautionary alert to its customers, regarding an anticipated interruption of flights in and out of Kenya and Tanzania. In the apology, it said that KLM flights in and out of Nairobi remain as per the schedule and no interruptions are anticipated. KLM has since communicated the correct position to the relevant government authorities through its Nairobi office. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, is the flag carrier airline of the Netherlands, with its hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. It is one of the major international airlines that offer scheduled commercial flights between Kenya and the Netherlands. The European country is a leading destination for Kenyan exports, mainly cut flowers, volumes that the aviation industry plays a key role in moving. Besides flowers, Kenya’s other exports to the Netherlands include tobacco, vegetables, and fruits. Netherlands exports to Kenya are mainly transport equipment, machinery, engines, and chemicals. Trade between the two nations has been strengthening since 2014.
