More than half of the world’s richest clubs by revenue are from the Premier League, according to analysis by Deloitte. Eleven Premier League clubs make up the top 20 in their Money League study from the 2021-22 season. It is the first time in the study’s 26 years that more than half of the clubs are from the same league. Champions Manchester City retained top spot, making 731m euros (£619.1m), ahead of Real Madrid (713.8m euros). Liverpool rise to third from seventh, while Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal also make the top 10, with West Ham, Leicester, Leeds, Everton and Newcastle in the top 20. The top 20 clubs made 9.2bn euros (£7.82bn), a 13 per cent increase from 2020-21. That increase is largely down to the return of fans to stadia for the first full season after Covid-19 restrictions, with matchday revenue rising from 111m euros to 1.4bn euros. Five of the Premier League’s ‘big six’ — Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur — reported revenue increases of 15 per cent or more. That saw a total increase of 226m euros. Commercial revenues rose eight per cent, from 3.5bn euros to 3.8bn euros (£2.975bn to £3.23bn) but there was an 11 per cent (485m euros/£412.25m) fall in broadcast revenue. Last season’s figures were higher than usual because of postponed matches from the 2019-20 season being played.
