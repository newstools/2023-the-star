Speaking when he held a consultative meeting with Sacco central promoter, Chelugui said his ministry is committed to supporting this initiative that will create efficiency and enable smaller Saccos access this state-of-the-art digital platform that will include access to the National Payment System. The government, he added, will also partner with regulated Saccos in the disbursement of the fund, especially the Micro business product which is being developed. Saccos are expected to play a big role in the disbursement and management of the microbusiness product. "The President will launch the second product which is designed for saccos, groups and chamas next month February," he said. "This one will be bigger because we'll be offering a minimum of Sh100, 000 and Sh2.5 million," he said, adding: "I appeal to Kenyans to borrow and pay because the data will be used to determine want happens in the next phase." A key campaign promise, the Hustler Fund is a financial inclusion initiative that seeks to cushion Kenyans from predatory digital lenders while also ensuring that they have access to cheap credit to boost their businesses.
