Athletes from parts of North Rift counties have embarked on a 400km journey to Maralal in Samburu County, for the regional cross country championships set for Saturday. Delegations from Turkana, West Pokot, Trans Nzoia and Elgeyo Marakwet counties started their travels on Thursday morning in a journey that will take more than eight hours on the road. Athletics Kenya North Rift region Public Relations officer Boniface Tiren said the counties have been hosting the championships on rotational basis and their journey to Maralal is part of a wider plan to take the sport to the grassroots. The championships will be used to select a regional team to the national championships set for January 21 at the Kenya Prisons Staff Training College in Ruiru, Kiambu County. "We always give an opportunity to our counties to host these events and this time we are heading to Samburu," said Tiren. "Samburu currently has a strong team and they could do with a little home advantage as they seek to qualify athletes in the team to represent our region at the national championships." Commonwealth Games 5,000m silver medalist Daniel Simiu is Samburu's biggest star at the moment. Tiren said they are certain of pulling of a good show, especially after succeeding to stage the event in Turkana, an area hotter than their current destination.
