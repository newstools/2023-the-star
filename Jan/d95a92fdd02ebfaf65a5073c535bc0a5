Kiambu Senator Karungo wa Thangwa has said Members of the County Assembly deserve to be given Ward Development Funds. In an interview on Wednesday on Spice FM, Thangwa said if MPs want Constituency Development Fund, MCAs should also have a portion of the county money for projects. Thangwa was talking in reference to the recent fight between Meru MCAs and Governor Kawira Mwangaza. "If an MP is fighting for CDF, what is wrong with an MCA having WDF," he said. The senator said if the governors want to have peace with the MCAs they should at least consider them when distributing funds. "If at all we want to nurture this leadership and I can tell any governor for free, with the experience I have had as an MCA, and as an executive, if you want peace with the MCAs let's have that development fund. You can call it equitable distribution of resources," he said. "You say in every ward I'm giving 20, 30 or 40 million for development then you leave the MCAs with the people to propose the projects that they want to do. When the MCA is doing that, he already knows he has the project money." Thangwa said they are coming up with a law that the development money the county budgets for, a certain percentage must be given to the ward asÂ development money. He said the MCA will be held accountable for what they do with the money.
