Chief Justice Martha Koome on Monday met with officials from Microsoft and the National Council on the Administration of Justice (NCAJ). The meeting was held in a bid to spur digital transformation in the justice sector. The Chief justice said that afterÂ the onset of COVID-19, courts have been using Microsoft Teams for their virtual hearings. "Adoption of technology by the courts has been revolutionary and the Judiciary aims to advance on the gains made thus far," Koome said. Koome spoke of intentions to partner with Microsoft to address the gaps that hinder access to justice. "In addition, through NCAJ_KE, we endeavour to make the justice chain accessible and people-centred, especially for the most vulnerable members in our communities," Koome added.
