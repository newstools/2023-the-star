Newly-crowned Nyanza South Athletics Kenya champions Paul Machoka and Teresia Omosa are keen on upsetting the form-book at the national championships set for January 21 at Prisons Staff Training College, Ruiru. The duo won their respective 10km races at Tendere Sports Ground in Kisii County. 25-year-old Machoka, who trains in Keroka, clocked 29:31.05 to win his first-ever regional title. He beat Richard Atuya to second place in 29:31.02 while Titus Mogusu of Jenga Talanta Athletics Club completed the podium finish in 29:41.08. Speaking after the race, Machoka said: “My technique is to run from the front. At five kilometres, I decided to open the gap and nobody caught up with me. I’m very happy with my first regional title." "It was a very challenging race since I competed against some of the best athletes from the region. However, the course and the weather were not that bad. I will continue training ahead of the national championships.” Experienced road racers Dennis Moronge (30:05.04) and Italy-based Dickson Simba (30:15.06) finished fourth and fifth respectively while Joel Moturi (30:26.08) picked the last spot for national championships. Italy-based Omosa won the senior women’s 10km race in 35:15.27 ahead of Lorna Nyabochoa (36:33.73) and Dolphin Nyagaka (37:12.38). Omosa said she was using the race to prepare for Rome Half Marathon to be held in March. “The course was a bit tough with many obstacles but that is the nature of cross country. I’m targeting a top 20 finish at the national championships,” she said. East Africa secondary schools 1,500m champion Mary Nyaboke from St Peter’s Keberesi Secondary won the 6km race in 20:27.90 followed by compatriot Dorca Isoe in 21:14.11 while Christine Otuke was third in 22:08.57. The Form Two student said she wants to represent Kenya at the Africa under-18/20 championships to be held in Lusaka, Zambia from April 19 to 23. “To be honest, the nationals are always very competitive but I will try to finish in the top six,” said Nyaboke. Andrew Kiptoo, also a student at St Peter’s Keberesi, blew away a strong field of 36 athletes to win the junior men’s 8km race. Kiptoo, a Form Three student, clocked 23:66.06 ahead of Vincent Mutai (24:02.02) and Job Kamonde ( 24:25.00). Pre-race favourite Felix Boera was relegated to fourth in 24:25.06. Felix Geieregger a guest runner from Austria also competed in the junior men’s event. Felix, 20, who is also an upcoming coach, said: “I’m pleased to be here. I came here to support some of my teammates and also prepare for races in Europe. The course was very nice but challenging.” Top six athletes in each race were picked to represent the region at the national championships.
