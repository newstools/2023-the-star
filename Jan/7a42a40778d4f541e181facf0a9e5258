According to the latest demographic and health survey, many young people aged between 15-24 years are getting infected with HIV-Aids. Slightly more than half of young people in Kenya know about HIV and prevention, while those with the least knowledge are adolescents aged between 15-17 years. Knowledge of how HIV is transmitted is crucial to enabling people to avoid infection. This is especially true for young people, who are at a greater risk of infection because they have shorter sexual relations. Young people are also at risk because they have multiple sexual partners or engage in other risky behaviours. The government needs to start running campaigns targeted at this endangered group so that they can make informed choices as they grow. It is also important that condoms be provided for free to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Combining prevention strategies may even be more effective. However, in order for any option to work, it must be used correctly and consistently.
