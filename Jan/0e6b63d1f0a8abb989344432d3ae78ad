Wazalendo coach Fidelis Kimanzi believes past record won't count as his charges face a titanic battle against Strathmore Gladiators in the men's hockey Premier League match at City Park Stadium, Sunday. Kimanzi, who doubles up as the national men's coach, urged his charges to focus on the game in an attempt to avoid a third consecutive defeat against the students. "They beat us in the league and in the Nairobi County Association league tournament in December but we can't allow the trend to continue," Kimanzi warned. "We know them well as much as they know us but we need to take lessons from the defeats. They (Strathmore) have found a way of competing against us but we have a point to prove." His opposite number Meshack Senge said mentality will be the difference. The Gladiators have been out of action for more than a month but Senge wants the team to maintain their structure. "Mentality counts a lot. Wazalendo are a good side that play with flair. We have analysed our opponents and we know what is required of us." Gladiators first play Kenya Police on Saturday at the same venue.Â  "Police are an experienced top side and we have planned around the match as well. We have to give our best shot and considering their experience, we have to use our strengths to bridge the weaknesses. We only have to do what is within our powers and see what happens," Senge remarked. Parkroad Badgers, who have already been relegated face Greensharks. In the men's Super League on Saturday, Nakuru host Wazalendo Masters, Multimedia University MMU square it out with Mvita as KCA University rub shoulders with Kisumu Youngstars. On Sunday, Parkroad Tigers take on Youngstars in the 9 am kick-off. KCAU face Mvita while the varsity derby pits Kenyatta University against Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. The only women's Super League match will pit Nairobi Chapel against MMU
