HalloPay has offered to sponsor jerseys for the upcoming season for Vitambi football team. Speaking while signing the partnership, HalloPay CEO Billy Ocharo expressed the companyâ€™s commitment in supporting young talent. "We have very promising teams in our communities that need all of us to come together and support them, not just the main local teams we have in Kenya," Ocharo said. He urged the government not to sideline community teams when spearheading talent development across the country. Vitambi team manager Mageto Nyarondia thanked the organisation for the timely support which he said will help steer the team to greater heights. However, he also called on the government to support community-based football teams. "Many youths have talents but don't have people to support them in the grassroots level, they want the government to support them," he said. Vitambi team captain Ongocho Mboya urged the players to take advantage of opportunities that come their way. Mboya encouraged them to embrace resilience and hard work. "Now that we have the jerseys we want to assure our fans that we will never miss any match,' Mboya said. Vitambi FC is a local football team that has been part of the local community for many years. The team's mission is to provide an opportunity for the youth to come unite and play football in a safe environment. The team has seen tremendous success in recent years, winning multiple regional championships and competing in national competitions. The new jerseys will be available for purchase at the team's upcoming matches.
