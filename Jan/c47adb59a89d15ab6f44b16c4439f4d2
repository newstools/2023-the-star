A baby who was at the centre of the Akorino twins' paternity drama has died in the hospital. According to a social media post made by the alleged father, the one-week-old baby girl died while undergoing treatment at a hospital in Nyandarua county. "Lack of money made us lose you Kui, we could have taken you to a better hospital," he said. Emily Macharia came into the limelight in 2022 after she alleged that she had been impregnated by either of the twins, saying she was dating both of them at the same time. "I don't know who the father is, we share the same bed. So I can't tell who the father is," she said in an interview. The twins, Peter Macharia and Teddy Kimathi, said they wanted to know who was responsible but they were elated all the same. Following an uproar on Social Media, the three came out to clarify that the act was just for fame and that they were doing it to get popular. They later sort forgiveness and prayers during a church ceremony.
