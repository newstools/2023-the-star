Some 1,000 bright but needy children who sat the 2022 KCPE have officially been commissioned into the Wings to Fly scholarship programme. The scholars from across the country converged at Pangani Girls High School for a three-day induction before the official commissioning on Monday. The commissioning of the 14th cohort brings the total number of comprehensive secondary school scholarships awarded to 48,009. Deputy director and project coordinator at the Ministry of Education Jane Mbugua said the scholarships boost 100 per cent transition to secondary schools. Mbugua who spoke at the event, was representing Education CS Ezekiel Machogu. "We are aware of the tremendous impact of such programmes. With proper resourcing of education, we can support needy families, uplift the society and avoid school dropouts,” she said. Equity Group Foundation executive chairman James Mwangi congratulated all the scholars in the 2023 cohort. Mwangi said they’ve earned the scholarships through their hard work and optimism. "As we give them the ‘Wings to Fly’ our hope is that this programme, as it also offers mentorship and coaching will equip them with the right tools to be transformational leaders in society,” he said. The Wings to Fly programme has demonstrated success with a 97 per cent secondary school completion rate. Another 82 per cent of the graduating scholars attain direct university entry grades to both local and global universities. The Wings to Fly applicants were onboarded through a transparent and rigorous community-based verification and monitoring process. Members of the community who serve on the Community Scholarship Selection Boards across the country reviewed and scrutinised the applications. They carried out face-to-face interviews and home visits before awarding the scholarships to the most deserving students.
