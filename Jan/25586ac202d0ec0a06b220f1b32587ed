Seven athletes from Torongo Training Camp in Baringo County are all set to compete at the 32nd edition of the Discovery Kenya cross-country race this Sunday at the Eldoret Sports Club. The camp’s head coach Barnabas Kitilit said the race has been the source of many athletes who have gone ahead to conquer the world. He said he will be traveling alongside Benson Moshon, Geoffrey Rono and Lukas Kiprop who will compete in the senior men’s 10km race. The 8km senior women's race will see Torongo represented by Josephine Wanjiku while Joel Loshakori, Evans Kipkosgei and Shadrach Kiptoo will be chasing top honours in the junior 8km race. Kitilit described the Discovery race as one of the most competitive cross-country events that are a must-attend for most runners. “This race has produced a lot of talent and most people who have featured here have gone ahead to win major races," said Kitilit. He said the competitive nature of the race has made it difficult for some athletes to defend their titles or win more than two titles since its inception in 1991. “There are always new champions every year and come Sunday, new champions will emerge across various events, " he noted.
