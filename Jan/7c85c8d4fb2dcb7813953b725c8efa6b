Tanzanian singer Nandy has unveiled the first artiste signed under her record label, The African Princess Label. Nandy introduced her signee Yammi TZ at a star-studded event. Yammi started off with an EP calledÂ Three Hearts with three songs: 'Namchukia', 'Hanipendi' and 'Tunapendezana'. A few days ago, Nandy said she almost got signed to Diamond's Wasafi Records. Nandy said she turned down the offer, adding that many other record labels wanted to sign her. "At first, I was supposed to be signed to Wasafi Records, but then I found myself on THT. "After that, a lot of record labels did approach me but I never signed with any of them because there is a specific level as an artiste I wanted to get to."
