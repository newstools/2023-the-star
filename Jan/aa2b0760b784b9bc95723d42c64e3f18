Organisers of the rebranded Sirikwa Classic, formerly Agnes Tirop Memorial World Athletics Cross country Tour, have announced an unchanged route for this years edition at Lobo Village, Uasin Gishu County. However, Local Organising Committee (LOC) chairman Ibrahim Hussein, who is also the race technical director, said the course has undergone some works including the removal of muddy patches and inclusion of steeplechase hurdles. Hussein this was informed by feedback from athletes who participated in the inaugural edition a year ago. “We have removed the water jumps and muddy patches but introduced some few hurdles to give the race some excitement and make it interesting,” said Hussein. "We will, however, maintain the artificial hills, some logs and incorporate some tents. We have very big tents where athletes run through. We shall have spectators and coaches on each side of the tents with music, soft drinks and food also in plenty. It will be very interesting. We have also set a very entertaining finish area.” “As much as the crowds were happy when athletes toiled in the mud and water, we have realised that this posed great danger to their careers. But it will not be smooth sailing since they will have to go over some obstacles which we feel will spice up things despite being friendly to the runners,” added Hussein. Hussein is hopeful that the rebranding will not affect the turn out as witnessed last year, when the emotions were high following the murder of former world cross country champion Agnes Tirop. “People already know we have this event but we have to make it more popular. We also have a campaign done by the media and road shows to inform the locals about the event. We are targeting Eldoret, Kapsabet and Iten. We also have a launch set for January 27. We are inviting sponsors to come in their numbers,” said Hussein.
