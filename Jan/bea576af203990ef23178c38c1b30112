Senate Speaker Amason Kingi has revealed that President William Ruto has a cordial working relationship with leaders from every sector. Kingi while making a speech on new years day said Ruto's non-discriminatory working conduct is key to pushing the agenda. Kingi was in the presence of President William Ruto during prayer service to usher in the New year at State House, Mombasa on December 31, 2022. "In your leadership, you do not want to know if a leader is in the opposition or not, as long as you are a leader you are willing to extend your hand to work with them," Kingi said. The speaker declared that the coastal region will fully support Ruto in achieving the Kenya Kwanza agenda. "As a leader, we are going to work with you, walk, with you for the prosperity of this nation," he added. On his part, Ruto said the government will not shy away from making tough decisions aimed at sustainable economic growth. He revealed that the removal of subsidies on basic commodities saves the country over Sh25 billion per month. The President added that the government was also implementing a debt management plan to lessen the country's loan burden. "We are focused on investing in areas that will drive our economy forward sustainably," he said. "I am confident that we have laid a foundation that will take our economy away from dependence on debt to dependence on revenue that is raised locally."
