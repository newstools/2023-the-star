Laikipia Health Services CEC Albert Taiti has said the county is focusing on improving the health services in the Northern part of the county. Addressing the Media on Saturday, Taiti said the Northern part of the county is where a majority of residents are underprivileged. He assured residents that apart from the dialysis machines in the renal unit the county has also planned more development projects. "One is the maternity project you have seen and it will be opened to decongest the male ward which is a disaster in waiting," he said. He said the fact that more patients keep coming is a sign that they have faith in the services the hospitals offer hence the need to improve the facility. "CT scan is on the way to improve the facilities,"Taiti said Taiti said each of the 15 wards in Laikipia will have a centre of excellence to decongest Nyahururu. " We want to do an affirmative action so that we can have proper services in the North and maybe the focus being on some of those health challenges that we have been having especially with the communities in the North," Taiti said " I believe by providing those services of health and other services, we shall be able to reduce the issues of insecurity in the North."
