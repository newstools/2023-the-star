Police arrested a man accused of planting 75 stems of bhang on his farm in Kyuso, Mwingi North, Kitui county on Tuesday morning. The bhang was thus confiscated, while the farm owner, a 37-year-old man was placed under police custody at Kyuso police station awaiting arraignment on Tuesday. Police commander, Nicholas Mutua said the man has been on the police radar for suspected peddling of bhang. “We are processing the suspect to be taken to court on Tuesday. I have also established that he is a habitual bhang peddler who had previously been arrested for the offence,” Mutua said. Mutua said they conducted a 4 am raid to where they nabbed the suspect. He said the police raided the home of the suspect following a tip-off from members of the public. Mutua said the police also recovered a nylon papers bag containing dry bhang leaves that weighed 205 grams from under the suspect's bed. “After he was arrested, he took the police to his shamba where he planted the bhang. Seventy-five plants of the illicit herb were uprooted and taken to the Kyuso police station as exhibit,” Mutua said.
