The government has released Sh8.6 billion for the program targeting 1,072,226 beneficiaries across the country. The fund is set to cover July-August and September-October 2022 payment cycles. Each of the beneficiaries, according to a statement from the ministry will get Sh8, 000. “The ministry has also released a further Sh11.2 million for nutrition improvement through cash and health education (NICHE), which is a complimentary program,” read the statement.
