The National Hospital Insurance Fund has clarified that it is currently not taking in new employees. This follows a post spreading on different social platforms announcing that the insurance institution is currently hiring. The undated fake post said that applicants are to meet a deadline of January 31 for permanent and pensionable terms of employment. The fake post also showed that the organisation had 23 vacant positions ranging from Nurses, lab technicians, clinicians and social workers, auditors and nutritionists among others. In a tweet on Wednesday, the insurance institution urged Kenyans to ignore social media messages purportingÂ that the institution is hiring. "Dear Kenyans. We are not hiring at the moment. Kindly ignore this message circulating on social media and other digital platforms," they tweeted. The insurance institution added that in case of any job advertisements, Kenyans will find them on their official website. "Kindly also note, if a job advertisement is not on our website, it is not official."
