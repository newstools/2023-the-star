Former Education CS George Magoha's wife Barbara Odudu Magoha has disclosed why she chose him for a husband. Speaking at their Lavington home on Tuesday after former President Uhuru Kenyatta visited them, Barbara said Magoha was a great believer in family. "He always said the family came first. He believed in family. From the first day he said if I am up and my family is down then I am down," she said. The wife said that it was what made her get involved with the former CS. She said many people would ask her why she left so many Nigerians to marry in Kenya. Barbara said that exactly after one month of meeting, Magoha started telling people they were going to get married. "I know you will not accept because I am not Nigerian so you go tell them you can't marry me," Magoha would tell her. She said Magoha had a caring attitude which she never saw anywhere.Â  She also described him as very loyal. "If he said he was going to be there at 2 o'clock, he would be there at that exact time," she said. She adds that Magoha always helped those who needed his help and he taught her to never kick an enemy at their weakest moment. Barbara said he was so forgiving; people never knew this. "During our argument, I would say I had a headache. He would stop arguing and take care of me saying what we were arguing about was over," she narrated. She adds that he was very supportive. And whenever she supported her husband, he always showed appreciation. "He would come and say without you I would never have made it," she said. "Saying I will miss him is an understatement, but I know we used to work like two major generals, him commanding the first battalion and I the second."
