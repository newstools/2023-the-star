Two Kenyan IT startups will benefit from linkages to expert mentorship and investors. This will accelerate the scale up of assistive technologies to the market. The two include Kijenzi, a Kenyan-based company founded by John Gersheson and Rahma assistive devices (RAD) founded by Aza Mohamed. Kijenzi uses localised digital manufacturing hubs to mass produce custom fit prosthetics and orthotics in less than 24 hours for clinicians and clinics. RAD provides a FreeWheel mobility chair to be used in geriatric and palliative care in order to increase the range of mobility of its users while preventing injury. FreeWheel ensures seamless lifting and transfers of the patient while enabling them to sit and stand unassisted. Other startups include Jobility based in Egypt, Dynalimb based in Nigeria, Deaftronics based in Botswana, Cure Bionics, a Tunisian-based company, Med Ezequiel, a South African company and Alivio, a UK-based company. Innovate Now, Africa's first Assistive Technology accelerator, made the announcement of its seventh cohort of innovators, which includes the eight ventures. “These innovations address the needs of users with hearing impairment, mobility issues and disabilities across the health and wellness sectors,” Innovate Now said in a statement. The startups will also benefit from a 12-week immersive and inclusive innovation curriculum and user-centred research through the Live Labs network. The ventures will work towards pitching at a demo day scheduled for April 13, 2023. The project is a partnership between Global Disability Innovation Hub, ICT Norway, Norad and Kilimanjaro Blind Trust. They recruit the next generation of cutting-edge disability innovators to drive Africa as a technology powerhouse.
