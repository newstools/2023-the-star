Safina leader Jimi Wanjigi has said the government should action regarding the criminal allegations in the Bomas of Kenya during the 2022 election period. Wanjigi said unless President William Ruto took action, his utterances would be in vain. The allegations made include the attempted murder of outgoing IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati, the threat to the life of the electoral body's officials and their families and the attempted bribery of the officials. "The Ruto government should take action on the serious crimes alleged in the Bomas of Kenya. In his executive, his actions carry weight; they speak louder than any words could do on their own," Wanjigi said. He added: "What he said today was largely meaningless unless he is, in fact, prepared to back it up by taking steps of the alleged capital offences." Speaking when he met chairpersons and members of independent and Constitutional Commissions on Monday, Ruto revealed the aforementioned accusations. "We know that there was a direct attempt to abduct Wafula Chebukati and murder him so that the commission would be paralysed, or a compliant commissioner takes over and subvert the peopleâ€™s sovereignty," he said. Ruto further said the scheme was hatched way before the August 2022 elections, when senior politicians teamed up to manage the presidential succession. He added that the plan was to guarantee a very specific outcome. The President further claimed the plan was the last resort after Chebukati and the outgoing commissioners Abdi Guliye and Molu Boya resisted other forms of coercion including bribery and intimidation. "We now know that Chairman Wafula Chebukati, commissioners Abdi Yakub Guliye and Boya Molu as well as the CEO, Hussein Marjan, and their staff, were offered stupendous financial rewards to cooperate with the agents of impunity, but they bravely resisted," Ruto said. Chebukati, Guliye and Molu's term in office ended on Tuesday, January 17, 2023.
