Less than a week after winning Sigona Bowl title, the Kenya Amateur Golf Championships KAGC) series opener at the par 72 Sigona Golf club, Michael Karanga will be chasing back-to-back titles when he tees off at Mount Kenya Championships this weekend. Karanga was the surprise winner at Sigona after rolling in numerous birdies for 10 under par 62 in the third and final round for the title. This weekend, he will try to upstage another strong at the par 72 Nyeri Golf Club course. “My next move is to compete at the Mount Kenya championships with hopes of winning back to back titles,” said Karanga ahead of this weekend's contest at the par 72 Nyeri Golf Club course. On Sunday, Karanga defeated round one and two leader Sandeep Matharu. Reigning national KAGC champion John Lejirma from Kenya Railways hit two under par 214 to finish second while Royal Club’s Jay Sandhu squeezed a score of 222 for third. The 36-hole Nyeri tournament will tee off on Saturday where Karanga will be up against defending champion Christopher Andrea, who fired one over par 145 for the title last year. Andrea defeated Ugandan Michael Alunga to second with two shots at three over par 147 as Kenya Railways Ebill Omollo completed the podium with similar score.
