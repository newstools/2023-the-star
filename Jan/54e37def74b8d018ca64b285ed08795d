Deputy President Rigathi Gachagu on Friday opened a sensitisation workshop at the Kenya School of Government. The workshop will allow phase one counties to participate in the national fertiliser subsidy programme. "This pilot phase targets about 2.1 million farmers in 12 counties," Gachagua said. More than four million farmers have already been registered for the programme. The farmers will access the subsidised fertiliser through an e-voucher for traceability and accountability. The workshop's representatives include Deputy County Commissioners, CeCs for Agriculture and Cooperatives, and County Cooperative officers from the 12 initial counties who will ensure delivery of the subsidy programme. Gachagua pointed out that subsidising agricultural production aims at bringing down the cost of living and making Kenya food secure. "This is in line with the Bottom-Up Economic Model, which will avail cheap fertiliser to farmers ahead of the long rains," he said. The DP said the multi-sectoral framework includes ministries of Interior, Agriculture, Treasury, Cooperatives,Â  Investment and Trade. The ministries will work with the counties.
