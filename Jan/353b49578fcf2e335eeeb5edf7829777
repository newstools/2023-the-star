Controversial singer Muigai Wa Njoroge says he will seek justice for his followers who were conned through a real estate company he marketed. On Tuesday, Festus Waigwa Muraya, 38, from Nyeri, told Nation he got to know Lesedi Developers through its aggressive social media marketing last year. The Thika-based Lesedi Developers, a real estate company, has left potential land and homeowners vulnerable with millions of shillings in bank loans to repay after selling non-existent plots in various parts of the country. Muigai, who was among the famous influencers, said he had seen the story and he would rise to demand justice for his followers who, through him, trusted the company. "No matter how much I was paid by any company or individual to market or advertise something on their behalf," he said. "If they fail to honour the agreement with their customers, I will sue them for that." Human right activist Boniface Mwangi said influencers should do due diligence on what they promote to their followers.
