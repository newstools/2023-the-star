Deputy President Gachagua Rigathi has revealed details of Dennis Itumbi and what he does at State House. Speaking in Kerugoya on Sunday, Gachagua revealed that Itumbi has no designated office, but a close aide to President William Ruto. "Many of you wonder what is the work of Itumbi. His office is known as come here go there. He is a close friend of our President," he said. Gachagua was responding to critics from Azimio who had claimed that Itumbi had been sidelined by Ruto while forming his communication team at State House. "Itumbi has no office, but he is in charge of everything. He arranges everything, he is the president's handler," Gachagua said. Gachagua further told the congregation that they should thank God that Itumbi was alive. He claimed that Itumbi was almost murdered but it was through God's grace that he survived. The DP further thanked the public of being the 'whistle-blowers' when Iutmbi was kidnapped. Despite Gachagua acknowledging that  calls for forgiveness, he said some incidents were hard to forgive and forget. " Our Bishop has preached of forgiveness but some scenarios are hard to forgive," he said. In December 2020, Itumbi said he is playing an integral role in Ruto’s administration. "I have a very important role which is, come here, go there. That is a very critical role in the government,” he said. Asked to clarify rumour that he is destined for the Government Spokesperson position, Itumbi said that is a great wish but his current position is 'come here, go there'.
