The Kenya Kwanza administration has reiterated its commitment to implement affordable housing projects across the country. This comes as President Ruto begins a two-day working tour of the Nyanza region, covering Kisumu, Homa Bay and Siaya counties. According to the State House spokesperson Hussein Mohamed the President will launch the first phase of the 5,000 affordable housing programme for Homa Bay county during tour. The project is expected to not only alleviate the housing deficit in the county, but significantly boost the local economy. Mohamed said just like other launched projects, housing essentials like doors, windows, gates and hinges will be supplied by local Jua Kali associations. This he said will boost the local economy and put money in the pockets of hustlers in Homa Bay. "It is also important to mention the role of the counties in the housing agenda. Homa Bay was the first devolved county government to sign the Affordable Housing (MoU) in April 2018," he said. The President said the county has set aside 11.6 acres for the affordable housing project. This support is critical to achieving the President’s Housing agenda to house our citizens with dignity. Already, 39 counties have identified land on which the houses will be built. "As the President has said, the affordable housing programme, which is a key plank of the government’s economic transformational agenda, is not only about low-cost and decent housing needs but also meant to create jobs for thousands of youth and stimulate the economy," Mohamed said. All this is in line with the President’s commitment to reduce the housing gap, which currently stands at 2 million units. Mohamed said the target is to increase the supply from 50,000 to 200,000, a year. Cumulatively, he added that the programme has a robust and active pipeline of 376 projects set to deliver more than 599,000 housing units across the country. These projects are at various stages.
