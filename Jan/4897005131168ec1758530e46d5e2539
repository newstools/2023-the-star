Nairobi County Assembly Minority Leader Anthony Kiragu has challenged Governor Johnson Sakaja to start unpacking his manifesto. Addressing the media on Thursday, Kiragu claimed that the Governor was in too many boardroom meetings instead of going to the ground and listening to residents' needs. “Four months after elections and the Governor is overdoing boardroom meetings. nothing is happening on the ground yet our people need services,” he said. Kiragu challenged Sakaja to emulate President William Ruto and other Governors who are busy launching and inspecting projects with minimal boardroom meetings. "Governor should wake up and realize Nairobi residents want to see projects being launched and services brought closer to their houses. Sakaja should wake up and get to work," he said. The remarks come a few days after Governor Sakaja released his 100 days scorecard. Also at the same, Sakaja is leading a one-week induction session with his cabinet and chief officers in Naivasha. The minority leader has been accusing the Governor of disrespecting Deputy president Rigathi Gachagua. DP Gachagua and Sakaja had locked horns over the intended relocation of long-distance matatus from Nairobi’s CBD to GreenPark Terminus. Sakaja however said the move was to decongest the CBD as well as to restore sanity.
