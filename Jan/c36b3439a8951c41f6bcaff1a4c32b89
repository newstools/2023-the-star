The Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service has termed claims doing rounds on social media about raised varsity entry points as fake news. A Facebook user by the name Nyagoya had alleged KUCCPS has raised the university entry from C+ to B plain in the KCSE 2022 exam. Nyagoya also claimed that only male students who scored 62 points and females who attained 61 points will be placed in university. "KUCCPS has raised the university entry from C+ to B plain (boys 62 points, girls 61 points," he posted. Through their Twitter account KUCCPS said information on students placement will be communicated officially through their page, website and official social media pages. "Advisory!! Beware of false information circulating in online forums. Information on student placement will be communicated officially through this page, the KUCCPS website and official social media pages. Kaa chonjo! #FakeNews," the tweet read.
