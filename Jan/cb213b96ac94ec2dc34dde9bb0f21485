Daniel Orina has reported to duty as the Nyamira county assembly clerk after being suspended for two years over allegations of misappropriation of funds in his capacity as clerk. Orina was sent on compulsory suspension in June 2020. Gratuity for MCAs for 2013 and 2017 and car loan are among other issues that were the basis of his dismissal which he says the County Public Service Board has settled and found baseless. The county assembly has been, since then, under acting clerk Duke Onyari who has been running the affairs of the assembly in the chair of the assembly clerk. Speaking to journalists in his office on Monday, Orina said he is grateful to speaker Enock Okero, Governor Amos Nyaribo and the entire county assembly leadership who saw it fit that he reports back to the office. “Patience has paid, I have waited for four years and nine months being outside but I am grateful that the county assembly leadership has finally resolved that I be back to office,” Orina said. “I received the letter from the speaker of the county assembly that required me to report to the office with immediate effect.” The clerk promised to ensure all the county assembly staff are united so that they can offer services. “We shall facilitate our MCAs to deliver on their mandate at the wards because the face of the assembly is the staff and if the staff does not do what is right, there will be unnecessary commotion and stress which will hinder service delivery,” Orina said.
