ODM leader Raila Odinga says he draws his inspiration from former South African President Nelson Mandela's legacy. Raila, who is in South Africa on a week-long tour said on Wednesday he visited the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Johannesburg where he skimmed through the late freedom fighter and anti-apartheid hero's legacy. "I'd like to express my gratitude to the Nelson Mandela Foundation for hosting me this afternoon and guiding me through Madiba's legacy, which they have preserved," Raila said in a statement on Twitter. The Azimio leader flew out of the country last Friday, the same day President William Ruto started the two-day working tour of his Nyanza backyard. His spokesman Dennis Onyango said in a statement the ODM leader would, while in the country, hold a series of meetings in his capacity as the AU High Representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa. He has held talks withÂ South African Minister for Tourism Lindiwe Sisula as well as African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) chief executive Nardos Bekele. Raila, who personally boasts of a rich political legacy, largely drawn from his pro-multiparty democracy advocacy, said the late president who was popularly known as Madiba, continues to inspire him posthumously. "Madiba's legacy has and will continue to inspire me. Hope it inspires you too," he said. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was an anti-apartheid activist who served as the first black president of South Africa. He served between 1994 and 1999 after being elected in the country's first democratic election. Mandela died on December 5, 2013, in Johannesburg aged 95-years-old but his legacy still lives on.
