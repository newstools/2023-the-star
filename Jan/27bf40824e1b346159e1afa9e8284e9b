ICT and Digital Economy CS Eliud Owalo has pardoned a man who was arrested for impersonating him on Facebook. This is according to a statement on Thursday by Adviser, Information, Communication and Media Relations Barrack Okwaro Muluka on behalf of the CS. The CS's decision was arrived at, after the accused, Calvince Otieno Odhiambo, expressed profound remorse and sought forgiveness for running the parody account. "Having considered the matter very closely, the CS instructs that the complaint be withdrawn without prejudice, on the understanding that Odhiambo is sincerely remorseful and that he will refrain from any further impersonation of people in the social media, and/or in any other way," Okwaro said. Owalo, however, regretted that some youth are using social media negatively, like impersonating leaders. "Accordingly, the CS is pained at the possibility of a young person with immense potential paying the price of injudicious and unlawful behaviour," Okwaro said. CS Owalo pointed out that social media can be an invaluable asset to the youth if put to positive energy. He expressed hope that the youth and Kenyans at large can use social media for constructive reasons, as intended. Otieno was arrested on Thursday, January 5. He hadÂ been promising business opportunities, employment and empowerment programmes to unsuspecting Kenyans, purporting to be Owalo.
