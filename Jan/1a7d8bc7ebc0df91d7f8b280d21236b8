Nineteen-year-old Cornelius Kogo is keen to use the Africa Under 20 Championships in Lusaka, Zambia later this year as a launch-pad to a career in athletics, just like his father, former world 10km record holder Micah Kogo. Cornelius is one of the beneficiaries of the Ministry of Sports and Athletics Kenya training camp held at Complete Sports in Uasin Gishu County ahead of the continental championships. As one of the captains in the training camp, Kogo said that he has been using the opportunity to earn a scholarship as well as running well to represent the country at major championships. “I have been here for the last two week and I have gained much experience ahead of the Africa Under 20 Championships. This is a great opportunity in my career growth,” he said. “We have been here and the federation played a critical role to ensure that we sharpen our talents to the top of the world. We shall use the skills acquired here to further our careers.” Meanwhile, Cornelius revealed he has been chasing scholarship opportunities but, unfortunately, luck is yet to shine upon him. "I have tried several times (to get a scholarship) but it is not forthcoming. I will continue trying my luck,” he said. “My father has been very supportive. He has been advising me to take one step at a time.”
