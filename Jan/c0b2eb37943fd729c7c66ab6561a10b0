A Suspected thief has been lynched in Mlolongo town, Machakos county. Mlolongo assistant county commissioner Dennis Ongaga said the unidentified man was burnt to death by irate members of the public on Monday, January 9. Ongaga said the incident occurred at the Cabro area in Mlolongo phase 3 Estate at around 6.00 am. The matter was reported to the Mlolongo police station as a mob justice incident. "Today at around 6.00 am an unknown person aged around 25-30 years suspected to have stolen a motorbike from Mlolongo Hhase 3 was beaten and burned by the mob beyond recognition," Ongaga told the Star on phone on Monday. He cautioned the public against taking the law into their own hands and report suspects to relevant authorities for legal action. "We condemn the incident and warn residents against mob justice. Anyone found shall be arrested and prosecuted, suspects should be handed over to face the rule of law," Ongaga said. Judge Roselyn Aburuli last week convicted two people for lynching a suspected mobile phone thief in Siaya county.
