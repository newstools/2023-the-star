Former Mukurwe-ini MP Kabando wa Kabando has said talks between President William Ruto and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga will be beneficial to the country. Speaking on Wednesday, the former MP said Kenya cannot grow when the Luo community is always marginalised. He insisted that inclusivity is a constitutional mandate and that he backs any efforts between the President and the Opposition leader to hold talks. "Kenya can't t yield when the gallant community Luo Nation is always marginalised despite a nationalistic intellectual input to our collective benefit. Inclusivity, Face Of Nation is a constitutional obligation. I support Ruto-Raila liaison, but it should benefit Luos and the country," Kabando said. He added that his intuition tells him there will be cooperation by the two leaders. The former MP claimed that the two leaders could be in talks and it is good for the country. He, however, said that he hopes whatever agreement they will settle on will not turn out to be like the handshake between retired President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. "Intuition, Instinct, Prediction: merger, cooperation, cohabitation unveiling. LOYAL OPPOSITION unfolding. Rt Hon Raila Odinga & President William Ruto are 'talking.' It is good for the country! Hopefully, it doesn't spur impunity ..."mwosho moja" deodorisation akin to handshake." Kabando's remarks come a few days after Raila faulted Ruto for opposing the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) constitutional amendment. He stated that he would not support the President's proposal to have the constitution amended until Ruto is honest about BBI. Raila while speaking in Mombasa said he would not hold talks with the Head of State over the same.
