State Department of Gender Principal Secretary Veronica Nduva has asked women to take advantage of the Hustler Fund. Nduva said that one of the nine-point agendas that President William Ruto had promised women was economic empowerment. She said that the fund is one of the initiatives that was meant to support the economic empowerment of women. "The last time I looked at the Hustler Fund statistics, men had borrowed more than women," she said. She said 47 per cent of Hustler Fund users were women and 53 per cent were men. "That should not be the precedent because the president had said that 50 per cent of the fund was designated for women," she said. Nduva was speaking at the launch of Echo Network and Democracy Trust Fund's report on gender analysis of the 2022 elections on Monday. She said that if the women present at the launch were yet to plug into the fund, they should do so to empower themselves economically, especially to support themselves during the next campaigns. "Leadership without economic empowerment cannot happen in this country," she said. She said another opportunity for Financial Inclusion is the Women Enterprise Fund. The PS requested all women who want to be elected to ultimately roll up their sleeves and be ready to do the hard work. "Be ready to get in the middle of where everything is happening and we ensure you that we will increase our numbers and show up our representation at every level," she said.
