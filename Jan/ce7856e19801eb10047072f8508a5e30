A man died on Sunday morning after he jumped off Nyali Bridge into the Indian Ocean in Mombasa county. The middle-aged man's identity was yet to be established by press time. Witnesses said the man jumped off the bridge at around 7am and died on the spot after hitting one of the pillars at the bridge. The county's fire brigade officers have since retrieved the body and taken it to the Coast General Hospital Mortuary. Police officers are investigating the matter. The incident came days after a video emerged online showing rescuers on speed boats rescuing a lady from drowning in the Indian Ocean. The lady reportedly jumped off the ferry at the Likoni crossing channel on a suspected suicide mission.
