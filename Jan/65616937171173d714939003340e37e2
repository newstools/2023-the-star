PIMAC International Election Observer has termed IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati, CEO Hussein Marjan and Commissioner Abdi Guliye as national heroes. They said both Local and International observers were both satisfied with Chebukati and staff management of the 2022 electoral process, results and post-election report and findings. They said it was a 99 per cent success of Democracy in Kenya through the voter and stakeholders. “It is unfortunate that election heroes and heroines went into hiding, some went missing and some killed as a result of a peaceful electoral process,” they said. The observers said they were shocked to hear about the pressure, forces and challenges that affected Chebukati’s entire tenure in the Commission. Yet, he remained firm and professional to deliver transparent, accountable, verifiable and reliable election results. Additionally, Guliye and Marjan revealed that they had to go into hiding for their safety after the announcement of the winner of the presidential elections on 15th august 2022. They said that the world at large and higher learning institutions can consider using Chebukati, Guliye and Marjan as well as local and international elections observers as examples of living legends and true experienced leaders in management of electoral process. “They are our heroes, though, to some of us, it was not news because we observed some of their challenges,” they said. They said that it is their prayer that the Government can consider giving Kenyans another leader of Chebukati's caliber - a hero. “They should get omeone who is trustworthy and reliable, to fill in the shoe of the Chairperson of IEBC and new commissioners to fill the gaps as new members of the commission,” they said.
