Akothee's firstborn daughter Vesha has called out local hotel industry management for allegedly treating people inappropriately. Speaking in a Live Instagram session, Vesha said she was once told she was indecently dressed during a Friday date. "I am 25 and I am allowed to dress the way I want since I am not anyone's wife," she said. Vesha was also given a limit on how much to spend if she sits at a particular place of a restaurant she visited. She has also witnessed Kenyans being asked to go wash their hands from the toilets as white people are given warm towels at the comfort of their seats. "We will walk into those restaurants coz this is our motherland and we need to be respected the same way the white people are respected," she said.
