Kenya Sevens star Collins Injera will be inducted into the Fiji Rugby Hall of fame during this week's  Coral Sevens starting on Thursday. Kenya's top Sevens try scorer and second in the world in the shorter version of the game will join rugby legends such as David Campese and Lote Tuqiri of Australia, Waisale Serevi (Fiji), the late Jonah Lomu, Viliame Satala (Fiji), Ben Golings (England), and Karl Tenana (New Zealand) in the star-studded hall of fame. Tournament founder Jay Whyte said they are delighted to have Injera in the Hall of Fame. "We decided to reach out to Collins as he finished his 7s career as the second top try scorer in the World Series and has delighted fans around the world with his skills,” he noted. Whyte added: “The concept and genesis behind the Hall of Fame is an idea I created to recognize legends of the game of rugby who have been servants of the game and helped to grow the game around the world,” he said. “The decision regarding the choice of players is simple in that they must be retired and not playing anymore. The plaques include their playing career statistical information, including things like the number of tries, games played, key achievements, et cetera. Injera will be inducted alongside Fiji 7s star of the 90's Noa Nadruku. Nadruku was one of the stars of the Fiji 7s team in the 90s before moving to Australia to make a name for himself in Rugby League with Canberra Raiders, where he won the 1994 Grand Final. In 1993 and 1996 he was the top try-scorer in the NRL.
