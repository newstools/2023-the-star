Several leaders from Tharaka Nithi trooped to the Karen home of departed businessman and politician Francis Kiambi to issue their condolences. Led by Interior CS Kithure Kindiki they said the cruel hand of death had robbed Tharaka Nithi and the people of Meru an iconic entrepreneur. "He not only built an impeccable business empire but helped inspire a generation of business people from the region and nation," Kindiki said. "We will remember him as an astute business leader whose acumen saw him establish one of the largest manufacturing industries in Kenya employing hundreds directly and impacting thousands." The businessman who was popularly known as Matanka was found dead at his Karen home under unclear circumstances on Monday. He got the name Matanka after he introduced the watermelon fruit in the semi-arid Tharaka constituency. The fruit is known as Matanka in the vernacular language. Kiambi was one of the directors of Patiala distillers. In 2017 he unsuccessfully vied for the Senate seat against Kindiki but remained as an active opinion leader in the community. He said Kiambi made many life-changing and impactful investments that will be missed by the Tharaka community. Tharaka MP Gitonga Murugara said residents of his constituency have lost a great leader. Politician Muthomi Micheni said many businessmen looked up to Kiambi. "We all looked up to him and sometimes consulted him here and there as he had many networks across the country," Micheni said. His wife said before his death they slept in a different room after she refused to guarantee him a Sh2 billion loan.
