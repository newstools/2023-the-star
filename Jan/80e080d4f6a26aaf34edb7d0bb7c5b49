President William Ruto has urged leaders to be vigilant and serve the people diligently. Speaking during an interdenominational service at Bomet Green Stadium on Sunday, Ruto said Kenyans delivered on their part of the bargain and it is now "our opportunity to discharge our part of the election contract". "We must transform the lives of the people; it is our primary responsibility," he said. He said it is possible to move the nation forward if leaders are united and committed to their work. "We will ensure this country steps into the strides that move us forward." Saying the government is working on eliminating hunger, Ruto added that the ongoing collection of data from farmers will inform on the right moves to make to produce more food. The President was accompanied by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula, Governors Hillary Barchok (Bomet), Eric Mutai (Kericho), several MPs and MCAs.
