Migori police have launched investigations into a fire incident at Kegonga sub-county hospital in Kuria East sub-county which occurred on Thursday. Goods and property estimated to be worth over Sh10 million have been lost after the fire started at about 1 am at the hospital's laboratory section before spreading to the pharmacy and records sections. Members of the public come in to rescue items and started to put off the fire before a fire engine from the county government arrived at 3 am and managed to control the fire. Allan Munema the administrator in charge of the hospital said the incident was reported at Kegonga police station and officers have started investigations to ascertain the cause of the fire. "We have lost a lot as our laboratory is gone together with the pharmacy where drugs were kept and records office. We are however working on seeing that services at the facility run smoothly despite the loss," Munema said. He said the incident left the hospital without drugs and patients who visited the facility could not access laboratory services. "I came for treatment and after I was referred for a test, I could not proceed further and I now have to go seek treatment elsewhere," James Mwita, a patient said. Those who needed drugs had to go buy from nearby chemists. "I have been told to buy drugs outside," Mary Bhoke said. Migori deputy governor Gimunta Mahiri said already they distributed drugs to the facility to ensure it runs smoothly as they seek to restore other basic functions. “We plan to buy a second fire engine in the next months to bolster us in such incidents and play emergency measures like fire fighting equipment in public institutions,” he said. Additionally, the county is putting our structures together and such things will be contained within time, he added.
