The Council of Governors chairperson Anne Waiguru has recognised the young, patriotic Kenyans who worked for long hours and low wages during the August 9 general elections. Speaking during the Post-Election Evaluation forum hosted by IEBC on Monday, Waiguru termed them as patriots especially those who made sure the August Election was a success. "These patriots delivered the election results that made Kenya's elections the pinnacle of Africa's democratic experience. Lost in the noise at Bomas is the story of these patriots who are unappreciated and uncelebrated," she said. She recounted how some lost their lives in the fight to preserve Kenya's democracy. "Even when some pay the ultimate price for their integrity with their lives, as happened with the returning officers in Gichugu and Embakasi, their stories are quickly forgotten," she said. "To these patriots who include: Returning officers, presiding officers, polling clerks and their supporting staff. This country owes you a debt of gratitude. Only God can reward you." Waiguru said they reflected on the performance in previous elections, what failed and the lessons learned to come up with recommendations that will inform the strategies for a successful 2027 general election. "We look forward to Kenya implementing proposed policy and strategic reforms from all election stakeholders," she said.
