The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has reiterated its commitment to eliminate overloading from Kenyan roads. KeNHA senior engineer from the Axle Load Control Unit, Kennedy Ndugire said this is aimed at safeguarding roads across the country. This comes after an overloading truck was detained at the Mlolongo Weighbridge Station. It was intercepted along the Mombasa Road by officials from the KeNHA Axle Load Enforcement Unit led by Senior Superintendent of Police John Gichuhi. "The truck has been fined under the East African Community Vehicle Load Control Act, 2016," KeNHA said. The said truck, which had an overload of 24.7 tonnes, attracted an overload fine of Sh13.9 million. Earlier in January, Ndugire warned that offenders, especially those with overloaded trucks on the Northern Corridor, will be fined a minimum of Sh45 million. The road links land-locked East African countries to the Mombasa Port. It serves Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, parts of DRC and South Sudan. Drivers of overloaded trucks also risk a jail term of three years or more. "Our trunk roads have cost Kenyans Sh3 trillion. We now must protect them. If you overload your truck be ready to pay Sh45 million as a fine or keep off the Northern Corridor," he said. He added that the Authority will deploy the Axle Load Enforcement Act for class B and S roads, which states that an offender is fined Sh4 million per overloader. "KeNHA has spent a considerable amount of money sensitising Kenyans on the dangers of overloading. It is now time for enforcement," Ndugire added.
