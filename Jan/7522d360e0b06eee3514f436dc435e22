Sarah Agolla believes the latest Youth camp at Marishaw School in Isinya is an inspiration to the upcoming athletes who have been offered the chance. Agolla, who is the first female rugby referee in East Africa now turned coach, said the platform offered by National Olympic Committee-Kenya is only getting better. She challenged the youth to maximise the opportunity to properly hone the skills that are vital for their development. "The camp is in an upward trajectory if what the athletes have acquired thus far is any barometer," Agolla said. She added: “It’s been an amazing journey and mine has been that of being lifted by someone and therefore being chosen to be able to impact the lives of these young athletes. Eventually, I know I will be held accountable, so I am happy because I see this as a chance for me to give back just as I was given.” The Youth Elite Camp in Kajiado county marks the third edition of the event that came into being in 2019. The inaugural edition of 2019 was held at Lukenya, Machakos County while Kenyatta University played host to the second edition. Through the development program, national youth coaches from various sports disciplines have been able to train young athletes on the basics and fundamentals of their sports. The camp now boasts of young athletes who have been able to transition from the junior to the senior levels in different sports. Some disciplines like hockey, basketball, and handball have seen great progress as a result of being in the camp and the coaches believe things are only bound to get better with consistent camp lined up in every school holiday. Beyond athlete development, the camp also looks to ensure that the coaches in the development program get advanced training regularly to increase their level of expertise which will eventually enable them to become better coaches. The camp is expected to end on January 18.
