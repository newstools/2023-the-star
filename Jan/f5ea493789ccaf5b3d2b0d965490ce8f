Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has asked Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja to go slow in his pursuit to regulate noise pollution in the city. Speaking during the Azimio rally at Kamukunji grounds on Monday, Kalonzo said the regulation of churches and nightclubs should be done through consultation. "The Bible says come and praise the name of God. How come now those who used to say they were supporting churches are now talking about environmental pollution?" Kalonzo posed. "So my friend, go slow," he said. The Wiper leader said young Kenyans have set up expensive lounges and nightclubs in the city to beat unemployment and should be let to run their businesses uninterrupted. "The youth are setting up expensive restaurants and lounges to put bread on their tables and you are saying you will close all that," he said. On December 1, Sakaja said he would not shut down noisy churches in the city's residential areas but would hold talks with them on observation of laws and regulations. "I will not close the churches. We want them to spread the gospel by obeying rules and regulations. I will initiate talks with them because we must be reasonable and accommodate each other in the city," he said. His remarks came a few days after City Hall canceled licences for nightclubs operating in residential areas on November 25, 2022, following numerous complaints from residents. Acting county secretary Jairus Musumba said in a notice that no nightclub licence will be issued or renewed for premises operating in residential areas. "Those already issued are hereby canceled and the establishments may continue operating as bars and restaurants," Musumba said. He further instructed bars and restaurants in residential areas to operate within the specified time and control the noise emanating from their premises. "Specifically, playing of music must stop by 10 pm," Musumba said. Kalonzo said the closure of the premises must follow public consultation.
