The Kenya Footballers Welfare Association has condemned an incident where the management of Trans Nzoia Falcons FC evicted players for allegedly losing a match. The management of the club threw the players out of their residential camp after their 3-0 loss to Vihiga Queens in a KPL match on Saturday. "We strongly condemn and are deeply saddened to hear of such acts in an era where the advocacy of rights and welfare of players globally are strongly guided," KEFWA president James Situma said in a statement. In a video shared online, the club's alleged management is seen throwing bedding out of rooms as players are heard lamenting about the sorry state of affairs. Situma said nothing justifies the inhumane manner in which the players were treated. "We are working in partnership with the Kenya Football Federation (FKF) to engage the club and tackle the issue at hand," Situma said. He meanwhile reminded football management stakeholders that before being athletes, players are first humans who deserve to be treated with dignity. "Therefore, every player must be provided with a safe and secure working place and sporting environment, holistically promoting their physical, , mental and social well-being," he said.
