United Democratic Alliance party candidate Barrow Dekow Mohamed has won the Garissa Township parliamentary by-election. Dekow , who is a brother-in-law of Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale, garnered 11,572 votes to win the seat. The Returning officer for Garissa Township Constituency by-election Abdi Yunis Mohamed declared him the winner on Friday morning. His competitors, Nassir Dolal Mohamed of the UDM got 8,158 votes,   Abdikhaim Osman Mohamed of DP,Abdifaisal Amin (ODM), Muhiadin Ahmed Abdirashid (DAPKenya) and  Ibrahim Nur Malow Shurie (Narc Kenya) got 840 marks. A total of 21,218 votes were cast representing 39.84 percent voter turnout Speaking after being declared the winner, Dekow pledged to serve the people of Garissa Township fully and offer them the services they need. "I shall serve the electorate fairly in this constituency," he said. Dekow also expressed his gratitude for all those who voted for him. The by-elections were on Thursday marred by a low voter turn out. A spot check in most of the polling stations that opened at 6am in Garissa showed no queues with polling clerks idling as they waited for voters to come. The seat fell vacant following the resignation of former MP Aden Duale, who was appointed Defence CS by President William Ruto. Candidates mounted intense campaigns over the last two weeks as they crisscrossed the cosmopolitan constituency in search of votes. Duale vigorously campaigned for the UDA candidate until the last day. The race was perceived to be a two horse , between Dekow and  Nasir  Mohamed of  UDM.
