President William Ruto and his deputy Rigathi Gachagua are currently in Kisumu at the State Lodge meeting leaders from the region. The two landed within the lakeside city at the Port from Homa Bay county. From the Port, the two leaders who were welcomed by Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyongâ€™o, Kisumu Central Mp Joshua Oron and Nyando MP Jared Okello went straight to the state Lodge. The head of state is currently in a meeting with local leaders from the Nyanza region. Residents waited to see President Ruto along the major streets from the airport road, to the Central Business District. "We thought that the President was going to land at the Kisumu international airport and head to the state lodge via road, but this did not happen," said Mark Oluoch who was along Oginga Odinga Streets. He added that they hope to see the President on Saturday before he heads to Siaya county. "We are not sure whether the President will spend the night in Kisumu but if yes, then let's hope to see him tomorrow."
