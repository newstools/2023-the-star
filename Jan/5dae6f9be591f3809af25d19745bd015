FormerÂ  Mukurweini MP Kabando wa Kabando has appealed to President William Ruto to act on the continuous production of illicit brew in Central Kenya Kabando pointed out that in 2015, the Central Kenya leadership rolled out efforts to curb the menace, but it has slowly steamed out. "Dear President William Ruto: 2015 Central Kenya leadership rolled out massive crackdowns on illicit brew & dangerous drugs. Unfortunately, the effort wasn't sustained. Hell has broken loose, again," Kabando said. He also called on Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua to act on the saying the situation is leading many users into depression and death. "Tears. Cries. Deaths. Depressions. Alcoholism. Narcotics. Please act. Rigathi," he added. Kabando pointed out that he has always spoken on the issue of illicit brew which he claimed targets to exterminate the people of the Central region. He said that producers of the brew were operating with impunity. "Some of us have consistently spoken about this problem - alcoholism & illicit drugs. But suppliers of these POISONS are operating with impunity. This is clearly a targeted extermination of our community!" Kabando added. He urged President Ruto to act on the matter and ensure the culprits are not spared. "Why are producers of these harmful substances being protected? Rais, help!" he asked.
