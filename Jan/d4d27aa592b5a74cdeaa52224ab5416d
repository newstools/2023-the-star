A remote village of Muyayi in Bukembe West Ward has been elevated after Morgan Wanjala Wabwile,19, scored an A (plain) in the just announced KCSE results. Wanjala was a beneficiary of the Former Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati's scholarship. He got an A plain of 82 points. Wanjala attended Muyayi primary school in Bukembe West ward and garnered 395 marks in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE). He joined Maseno School in Kisumu County in form one. Wanjala says that he wants to study medical surgery at the University. He thanked his family for prayers and support saying that his father Francis Wabwile gave him all the necessary support he needed to succeed in his KCSE exams. Wanjala said it was not easy for him to score an A plain as most of the time he was thinking of where his family will get his varsity fees. He says that after completing his KCPE education, he applied for the Wangamati scholarship and luckily he was picked and included on the scholarship kitty until his form four. “After receiving my KCPE exams, I thought that my dream of joining Maseno School was shut but with God’s grace I was selected to be part of the Wangamati scholarship beneficiary,” Wanjala said. “If it were not for our former governor Wangamati I could not be where I am today.” His father, Francis Wabwile said he is very grateful for his son’s performance asking other education sponsors to take him and support him in realising his dream. Area MCA Antony Lusenaka said he will work closely with Governor Ken Lusaka to ensure that poor learners get sponsorship. The ward rep said that in 2021 former governor Wycliffe Wangamati supported 14 students from Bukembe westward. Lusenaka who is the minority leader at the Bungoma County assembly is serving his second term as an MCA elected in the DAP-K party.
