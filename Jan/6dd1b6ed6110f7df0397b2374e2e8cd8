Singer Akon's recent sentiment about men being 'gods' in Africa has stirred debate online. Akon appeared on 'The Joe Budden' Podcast, where he gave his thoughts on gender roles in Africa compared to America. In the podcast, the singer said men are 'the divine kings of the universe'. The singer said while women need a man to create life, men do not, and could have a child by putting their sperm in an “incubator”. "Let me tell you the science of it,” he said. "A man right now can create life without a woman, but a woman cannot create life without a man. "If I wanted to do it right now, I would shoot my sperm and put it in an incubator and give it nine months, even maybe less with today’s science, and a baby will be born." The 'Lonely' singer said women in Africa treat their men like kings compared to other countries. "We're gods, the ones that create life. Women aren’t competing with you or fighting for equality because they understand that men and women could never be equal," he said. "The roles there are very defined and very clean. Here [the US], even if I say, ‘Play your role and I play mine’, they say, ‘What the f**k you mean play my role? What role?’ "In Africa, it’s very clear, the woman plays the role of the woman. As a woman, her role is to support the man. "The men are the kings and the divine of this universe. A woman can never compare to the man."
