The Ministry of Repentance and Holiness has refuted claims that Prophet Dr. David Owuor is out of the country for treatment. In a statement, the Ministry's official radio, Jesus is LORD Radio, said the claims were fake. "Kindly be notified of fake news out there," it said. The Ministry further quoted the Bible saying: "The Messiah is coming." "Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Matthew 5:11." This comes days after the man ofÂ  God held a mega crusade at Menengai Grounds in Nakuru. During the two-day crusade on December 30 and 31,2022, the Prophet is said to have healed the blind and the crippled. The event was the ministry's fifth service at the grounds which has become the man of God's traditional site for his healing service at the end of the year.
