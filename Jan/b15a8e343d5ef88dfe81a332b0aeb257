Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has said she does not have a television in her living room. This, she said, helps separate outside politics from home affairs. “I don’t know whether you will believe this but we don’t have a TV in our living room, that way we separate the political discussions we have outside there from what goes on when we come home,” she said. Waiguru spoke in an interview with NTV on Monday night. She was first elected as the county boss in the 2017 general elections. In 2022, she defended her seat and was re-elected. In September 2022, she was elected as the CoG chair. Previously, between 2017 and 2019, she served as the first female vice chair of the COG. Waiguru said she has strived to maintain her friends, acknowledging that politics is temporary. Some of her friends, she said are her high school mates while others have been acquired over time in her political career. “I have the same friends, I have got my friend for very many years, my closest friends have been with me since high school my best friend was my deskmate in Form 1 when I was 17,” she said. “I have time for them, so I am just the same person because politics comes to an end and is not permanent but life is permanent so I try as much as possible to keep my life going as normally as possible.” The governor was working in the development world, coordinating programmes at the bank with Parliamentarians when she got an opportunity in the government. She was seconded to the Office of the President, then third President, the late Mwai Kibaki.
