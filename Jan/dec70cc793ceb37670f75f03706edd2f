A Narok court has convicted a fifty-year-old man on his own plea of guilty for marrying a nine-year-old girl in the year 2019 at Entasekera area in Narok South Sub County. Mzee Saigilu Ololosereka, who appeared before Narok Senior Resident Magistrate Phyllis Shinyada told the court that he was given the girl for marriage by the girl’s father Senteu Ole Mareu. Narok Children’s officer Pilot Khaemba told the court that the marriage was discovered after the minor, who is now 12 years old, developed complications during delivery and had to be rushed to the Narok County Referral Hospital for treatment. The minor, who was accompanied by her elderly husband to the hospital, underwent a cesarean section but unfortunately experienced a stillbirth. An age assessment carried out on the girl showed that she was only 12 years old. The children's officer prayed the court to grant his office permission to commit the young girl, who is yet to be discharged from the hospital to Taraja Children’s home in Machakos County, a prayer that was granted by the court. Following the seriousness of the matter, the Senior Resident Magistrate Shinyada called on the court clerk to read out the charges to the old man in the Maasai language that he best understood cautioning him of the stern punishment that comes with the kind of offence he had committed. Surprisingly, Mzee Ololosereka reiterated that the charges were true and that the young girl was his wife whom he dearly protected. The State Counsel prosecuting the case told the court that the elderly man was a first offender but reiterated the seriousness of the offence he had committed as it attracts life imprisonment. Ms Shinyada convicted the old man on his own plea guilty and ordered that he stays in police custody until January 11, 2023, when the judgement will be passed. The court also issued a warrant of arrest to the girl’s parents who had allegedly subjected the minor to early marriage.
