Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has promised former IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati security in retirement. Speaking on Tuesday, Gachagua said that Chebukati antagonised dangerous and powerful people during his tenure hence the need to be protected. "As a responsible government, we have made an adequate arrangement that in your retirement you have full protection and security to enjoy your life without fear so that you are safe because those are not good people," he said. Gachagua said that Chebukati, commissioners Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye stood up for Kenyans. The DP lauded President William Ruto's effort to maintain the independency of institutions. The former chairman and the two commissioners leave IEBC as their terms end on January 17 after six years of service. Chaos erupted at Bomas shortly before Chebukati announced the 2022 presidential election results. IEBC vice chairperson Juliana Cherera and four other commissioners disowned the results. Cherera and commissioners Francis Wanderi and Justus Nyang'aya later resigned from office. Commissioner Irine Masit, who is on suspension, is fighting for survival before a tribunal. Chebukati highlighted major achievements at the commission during his tenure. Speaking in his last official function on Monday, Chebukati said he has no regrets as he bowed out. “I exit contented that we gave it our best to this commission. We chartered and weathered storms that threatened the existence of the commission,” he stated. Chebukati mentioned voter register audit and deployment of a public election portal as some of the key achievements during his six-year tenure at the commission.
