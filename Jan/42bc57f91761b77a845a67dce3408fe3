Twenty-five members of the Zimbabwean opposition party, the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), have been released on bail by a court in Harare. The group - including two MPs - was arrested earlier this month and charged with holding an unlawful gathering with the intention to cause violence. The CCC says it was a private meeting in a member's home. It was the latest in a series of arrests of opposition members and government critics on similar charges. The CCC has accused the governing Zanu-PF party of using the police against its opponents ahead of an election this year. Another CCC legislator, Job Sikhala, has been in jail for more than seven months on charges including incitement to violence.
