Kenya Police edged out Butali Warriors 1-0 in the Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League season finale to book a slot for next month's  African Club Championship. Veteran defender Sammy Oungo scored the only goal from the penalty spot in the 44th minute during the match played at City Park Stadium. Police goalkeeper Joshua Omondi was the hero of the day as the law enforcers got the better of the champions as the curtains came down on the prestigious festival. Omondi denied Butali captain Constant Wakhura an equaliser after saving his spot kick as the sugar millers finally lost their first match of the season. Police join Butali for the Africa competition planned for  Nairobi from February 13-19. Despite the loss, Butali team manager Kamal Sembi said title defence was their priority. “We wanted to defend the title unbeaten but it proved tough against Police. We blame ourselves because we had many scoring chances but complacency cost us," said Sembi. In the women's top-tier match, champions Strathmore Scorpions beat Wolverines 2-0 to end the season unbeaten. Maurine Ogoche and Rachel Khamala scored in the second and 36th minute respectively. Scorpions coach Meshack Senge was elated to finally win his first league title with the girls' team saying, “I can look back and say the structures we have put in place have worked and paid us back. I’m happy that we are the first university to have won the women’s title. We hope to build on the momentum and perform well at the Africa club show but the feeling is humbling,” said Senge.
