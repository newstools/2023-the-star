A family in Emuhaya is appealing to security agents to help them find the head of their member who was killed on December 27. They want security agents to trace the head of Alfred Esilaba before he is buried. His headless body was found in his bedroom. The case was reported on December 28. According to the residents, Esilaba’s head was last seen at a nearby home before it went missing the same day. Deputy county commissioner Chuck Musau said Esilaba’s murder was engineered by people within that area. “You can’t tell me that Esilaba was murdered by people who came from far, that’s impossible and if those individuals came from far then be sure they were guided by residents here and they are within us,” he said. Musau urged residents to work with security agents to unfold the murder puzzle for their safety. “If the culprits are not brought to book, they will come back to kill other people so we must work as a team to nail them down,” OCPD Gabriel Muriu said. Muriu said individuals must take part in matters of security from their homes to the subcounty. Area MP Omboko Milemba now wants the Internal Security CS Kindiki Kithure to add more security officers within the subcounty to tame the insecurity problem. “The CS must equip our security officers with the required tools to face this problem,” he said.
