Prince Harry has said "I would like to get my father back, I would like to have my brother back" in an interview ahead of the release of his book Spare. He also says "they've shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile," although it is not clear who he is referring to. He made the comments during a sit down with ITV's Tom Bradby and has also given an interview to US broadcaster CBS. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. Both interviews will be broadcast on 8 January, two days before the autobiography is published. Speaking to CBS News journalist Anderson Cooper in a chat the broadcaster described as "explosive", Prince Harry claims he was "betrayed" with "briefings and leakings and planting of stories against me and my wife". He said: "The family motto is 'never complain, never explain', but it's just a motto. "They will feed or have a conversation with a correspondent, and that correspondent will literally be spoon-fed information and write the story, and at the bottom of it, they will say they have reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment. "But the whole story is Buckingham Palace commenting. "So when we're being told for the last six years, 'we can't put a statement out to protect you', but you do it for other members of the family, there becomes a point when silence is betrayal."
