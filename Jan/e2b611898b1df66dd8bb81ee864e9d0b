A man has been arraigned at Loitoktok law court charged with defiling two girls aged 10 years. Frank Juda, who appeared before resident magistrate Samuel Ndungu, is charged with defiling the two girls at Orngodwa village, Loitoktok subcounty, on October 20 last year. According to the girls, who are friends and come from different homes, on the material day they were sent by their parents to fetch firewood in a nearby forest. While in the forest they were approached by the accused who accosted them and introduced himself as a magician before defiling them. The accused threatened to throw a jinni to them if they revealed the ordeal to anyone before releasing them to go home. L L, father of one of the girls, told the court how his mother who had sent her granddaughter to fetch firewood called him home only to find his daughter bleeding and crying. After being informed what happened, he took her to Kimana dispensary for treatment before reporting at Kimana police post. K M, uncle to the other minor who works with Biglife Conservancy told the court how they launched a hunt of the assailant with sniffer dogs and the following day were able to arrest him and was positively identified by the girls. The accused was charged and arraigned in court where he denied the allegations. The court adjourned the matter for further hearing on February 21.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
