Late Education CS George Magoha's widow Barbara Odudu Magoha has said the toughest time of their marriage was during the Covid-19 pandemic. Odudu was speaking at their Lavington home on Tuesday after former President Uhuru Kenyatta visited them. She explained that during the pandemic, Magoha had to make frequent travels and meet people due to the nature of his work. Odudu was worried that her husband might contract the virus. "I told him if this is the way you were meant to go, then you will go. If it is not, you will pull through. You have to do what you have to do. You have to take the risk," she said. Odudu said even though Magoha was not a practising medic he was always exposed to the virus. Adding that the entire family was also exposed to the virus. " You can imagine a family of doctors; he was not a doctor, but he was so exposed. There was I with my patients, here was my son, and my daughter-in-law who are all doctors," Odudu said. She said during the time, they decided to leave everything to fate, to let nature take its course. "We were like if it happens, it happens, but we must soldier on," she said. She said she kept supporting him and they made it through the pandemic.
