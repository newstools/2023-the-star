Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi will grace the late Catherine Kasavuliâ€™s fundraising as the chief guest. Musalia will be grace the event alongside other notable chief guests at the United Kenya Club on Saturday January 7, 2023. The family is so far seeking the help of well-wishers to offset an outstanding bill of Sh4 million accrued at the Kenyatta National Hospital during her stay and treatment at the facility. The programme that has been released shows that a church service for the late TV queen will be held on Thursday January 12 , 2023 at the Friends International Church along Ngong Road with the final service taking place at her rural home at Tigoi Primary School on Saturday January 14. Kasavuli passed away on Thursday night aged 60 at the KNH after battling with cancer. Kasavuli had been admitted at the facility since October 26,2023. In November, colleagues and friends in the media industry mobilised people to donate blood for urgent transfusion after she was admitted at KNH. Kasavuli's employer KBC appealed for blood donation as she is admitted to Kenyatta hospital's Private wing. She had recently returned on TV after KBC hired her among veterans to revamp the media house. Kasavuli had taken a four-month break and returned to her Instagram in October.
