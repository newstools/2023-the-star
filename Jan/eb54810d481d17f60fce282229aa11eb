The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) ranked motorcycles as the most dangerous type of mode of transport in 2022. According to data, bodabodas contributed to the highest number of fatalities in 2022 recording 1,209 fatalities. This is an increase compared to 1,154 recorded in the previous year. Private vehicles came in second by recording 1,104 fatalities compared to 1,172 in 2021. Commercial vehicles recorded 1.079 fatalities compared to 1,019 in 2021 while Public Service Vehicles had 626 fatalities compared to 534 in 2021. Unknown vehicles had 543 fatalities compared to 608 in 2021 and Government cars recorded 43 fatalities as to 29 in 2021. In 2022, fatalities as a result of accidents cause by Tuktuk were 37 compared to 23 in 2021 while bicycles recorded 23 deaths, a drop compared to 22 in 2021. Handcart recorded seven fatalities, ambulance â€“six and train had one in 2022. At least 21,760 people were involved in road accidents last year, the National Transport and Safety Authority said. "4,690 died while the rest were left mostly with life-changing injuries," NTSA said. At least 9,933 people were seriously injured and 7,137 were slightly injured. Over the last four years, NTSA has expressed concerns over the increasing number of accidents caused by boda boda operators. On November 22, 2018, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and his Transport counterpart James Macharia gazetted a task force to introduce reforms in the boda-boda sector. The 12-member team on policy, legal and administrative reforms on public motorcycle transport were given 60 days to execute its mandate. However, little was heard from the task force. Last year, NTSA formulated rules to have bodaboda operators registered into Saccos. This, the agency said, will ensure accountability and help curb road fatalities. NTSA Deputy Director of Road Safety Programmes Duncan Kibogong said bodabodas will have to operate in a formal system and register in Saccos, just like the matatu sector, where they will have a chairperson and team leaders.
