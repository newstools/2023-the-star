United Democratic Alliance has emerged victorious after  Chege Njuguna was declared the winner for the  Kandara MP seat. Njuguna garnered 21,650 votes against Ford Asili's Titus Njau Mbuchu who got 14,678 votes in the by-election. Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro congratulated Njuguna saying that he won the seat decisively. "Congratulations to the great people of Kandara for the confidence. Tunawashukuru sana (we thank you). Chege Njuguna will work and deliver progress. We are Africans and Africa is our Business," he said. Senate Majority leader Aaron Cheruiyot said UDA had emerged victorious in three out of four seats. "The wheelbarrow still reigns supreme. Well done to all our candidates. Thanks also to the people of Garrissa, Kandara and Elgeyo Marakwet for reaffirming your belief in Kenya Kwanza," he said. The constituency fell vacant following the appointment of former MP Alice Whaome as Water Cabinet Secretary. Wahome had been elected for her third term in the August 2022 polls.
