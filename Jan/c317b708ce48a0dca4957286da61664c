Speaker of the Senate Amason Kingi has send a message of condolence to the Democratic Republic of Congo after a bomb attack at a church left five people dead. Fifteen worshippers were also wounded following the explosion at a church in the eastern city of Kasindi. "Condolences to our DRC brothers and sisters...We express solidarity with the people of DRC and pray for justice on behalf of all those affected," he said. An army spokesperson who spoke to the media said the incident is suspected to have been carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). The ADF is a Ugandan armed group that has pledged allegiance to ISIL (ISIS). "Despite the security measures put in place, the first indications show that it is the ADF which is behind this bomb attack," Anthony Mualushay told Reuters. ADF has, however, not claimed responsibility for the attack.
