President William Ruto and opposition leader Raila Odinga will Sunday hold parallel events amid a looming political showdown. The President is expected in Narok for a thanksgiving service at the William Ntimama stadium. The church service expected to be attended by top Kenya Kwanza administration politicians, could be characterised by heavy anti-Raila jibes. In the capital city, Raila will hold a mega rally at the historic Jakaranda grounds. This is the second gathering in a week as part of his political resistance against Ruto's government. Raila has claimed that Ruto did not trounce him in the August 9 polls and he therefore must resign as President. However, Ruto was declared the winner of the closely-fought polls, narrowly beating Raila with slightly over 300, 000 votes. The President's troops have trained their guns on Raila whom they have accused of scheming to sabotage the economy through his planned countrywide rallies. On Saturday, Raila's allies toured the Jacaranda ground to assess preparations for the rally. Raila will this morning attend a church service at Wanyiri area ahead of the Jakaranda rally in the afternoon. Makadara MP George Aladwa told the Star that the rally is on after the church service. "We are heading to church from 11am and I ask all the leaders to join us in the church before going to Jakaranda," Aladwa said. His Embakasi East counterpart Babu Owino termed the event the 'grandmother' of all rallies. Ruto's allies including Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua have asked the President not to be distracted by Raila's political plots and instead focus on serving Kenyans. They have, however, warned Raila and his supporters against rallies that could lead to destruction of property.
