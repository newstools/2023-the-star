Meru Governor Kawira Mwangaza has sent a message of a happy New Year to Kenyans. In a lengthy message on her Facebook account on Sunday, Mwangaza said 2023 was a year of praise, adding that Meru county will praise. "Year of Praise 2023. May your mouth, and heart be full of praise in Jesus Mighty Name. Meru county we shall praise," she said. Mwangaza, who had posted photos of herself and Meru's First Gentleman with musical instruments, added that praise is a God-given weapon in the hands of humankind with which to humiliate the devil. "It is Godâ€™s medicine against the enemy," she said. "Every time we obey the law of praise, we silence our adversaries. Everyone who lives in praise carries authority with him because he has the backing of heaven." The governor quoted 1 Samuel 17:50 on how David defeated Goliath because he had a praise connection to heaven. "This shows that praise is the path of life, the winning ticket anytime. With the anointing of praise upon our lives, we become an all-round winner in the battles of life," she said.
