A double-header at Gusii Stadium will be the highlight of the FKF National Super League (NSL) Match Day 7 on Wednesday. In the first match, Gusii FC will host Mara Sugar from 1 pm while the second match will see Shabana host Mwatate United at 3 pm. The teams recorded contrasting results over the weekend with Gusii thrashing a hapless Vihiga United 9-1 while Mara Sugar lost 1-0 against Shabana FC at Awendo Green Stadium. Shabana, under the tutelage of Sammy Okoth, hope to maintain their unbeaten run in the league so far. Last weekend, Mwatate lost 2-0 to log leaders Kibera Black Stars. Kibera Black Stars lead the log with 13 points same as Shabana but the Nairobi-based side have a better goal difference and have played one game more than Shabana. During the doubleheader, Shabana will be in charge of gate collections and will provide an ambulance while Gusii FC will provide security, according to Shabana secretary general Elzaphan Kerama. Gate charges will be Sh200 for VIPs and Sh50 for terraces. On Wednesday, Kibera Black Stars will host Naivas at Camp Toyoyo hoping to extend their lead on top of the log while Kisumu All Stars will be at home against Kajiado FC. Migori Youth will host beleaguered Vihiga United at Migori Stadium as Mully Children’s Family battle SS Assad at Thika Green Stadium. Darajani Gogo host Mombasa Elite at Hope Center while Murang’a Seal and Silibwet will collide at St. Sebastian Park. It’s still uncertain if the game between Administration Police (APS) Bomet and Fortune Sacco will go on at Bomet Stadium. The two teams have not played in the league this season, protesting the decision by FKF to annul the 2021/22 season. If Fortune Sacco fail to honour Wednesday’s fixture, they will be relegated from the second-tier league. They have so far dished two walkovers.
