Dozens of police have been mobilized to ensure security ahead of Azimio rally at Jacaranda in Nairobi. Nairobi police boss Adamson Bungei said his team had met with organizers of the event and agreed on various modalities. This will ensure it starts and ends well. “No one wants chaos. We are here for all,” he said. He said more personnel had been mobilized to also provide security for the scheduled Mashemeji Derby. Opposition leader Raila Odinga will hold a mega rally at the historic Jacaranda grounds. This is the second gathering in a week as part of his political resistance against Ruto's government. Raila has claimed that Ruto did not trounce him in the August 9 polls and he therefore must resign as President. However, Ruto was declared the winner of the closely-fought polls, narrowly beating Raila with slightly over 300, 000 votes. The President's troops have trained their guns on Raila whom they have accused of scheming to sabotage the economy through his planned countrywide rallies. On Saturday, Raila's allies toured the Jacaranda ground to assess preparations for the rally. Raila will this morning attend a church service at Wanyiri area ahead of the Jacaranda rally in the afternoon. Earlier, Gor Mahia football club urged opposition leader Raila Odinga to cancel his planned Jacaranda rally in favour of the Mashemeji Derby. Instead, they wanted Raila to grace the football match. "We the Kogalo fraternity are aware that you have planned a consultative meeting with wananchi cum demo on January 29, 2023," reads a letter addressed to Raila dated January 26, 2023.
