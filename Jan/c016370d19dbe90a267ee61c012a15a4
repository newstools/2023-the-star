The case will be mentioned on 30 January and heard on May 4. Three journalists; Elias Yaa (The Star), Daniel Peshu (NTV) and Maureen Ongala (Daily Nation) were covering a peaceful demonstration at the grounds. Some Kilifi residents were demonstrating against the hiring of two brothers by the county government. Trouble started when Nixon Muramba, the acting chief of staff in the office of Governor Gideon Mungâ€™aro arrived at the Karisa Maitha grounds with a rival group. The county Head of Inspectorate and other officers from the office of the governor accompanied Mramba. One of the officers asked the organisers of the protests to come forward and explain to the chief of staff their grievances. Muramba later took over to address the protestors, but he was cut short by his group who took him off the venue and ordered everyone including journalists to vacate the area. The group tore the placards from the protestors and started attacking journalists who were taking photos.
