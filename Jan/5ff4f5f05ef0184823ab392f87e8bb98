Ulinzi Starlets hope to bounce back to winning ways when they take on Wadadia at Ulinzi Sports Complex in one of the six matches lined up in the Kenya Women's Premier League this weekend. The soldiers lost to Nakuru City Queens 3-1 last weekend. Coach Joseph Mwanza said the team can't afford to lose further ground at the top, tipping his charges to put their rivals to the sword. Wounded Wadadia were outclassed 3-0 by a rampant Thika Queens at Mumias in their last tie, making this clash a thrilling encounter altogether. "It is a must-win for us if we have to cope with other teams at the top," Mwanza said. "We have a fully fit squad, eager to make amends after a horror show against Nakuru. We want to make Ulinzi Complex our fortress and a tough place to visit." Defending champions Vihiga Queens travel to Thika to rekindle their rivalry with Thika Queens on Sunday. Vihiga dropped their first points of the season in the goalless draw against Bunyore Starlets as the Boniface Nyamunyamu-coached side put in an insipid performance. The away match will be a litmus test for the four-time WPL champions. On-form Bunyore visit the Gems Cambridge to settle scores with Kangemi Ladies. Despite being in their second season in the top tier, Bunyore has proved a tough nut to crash especially at Mumboha. Nakuru will hope to pick up from where they left off as they welcome Zetech Sparks at the showground, Nakuru. Both sides are in rich form. Sparks annihilated Kayole Starlets 5-0 but consistency is still lacking. It remains to be seen whether Trans Nzoia Falcons will honour their match against Kayole. Falcons dished a walkover against Gaspo in mid-week with in-house issues affecting the team. Kisumu All Starlets face Gaspo at Moi stadium, Kisumu.
