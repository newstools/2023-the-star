Kenyan artiste and performer based in the US, King Kanja, has released his first single of the year, “Maliah”, featuring Brooklyn and New York native Kai Ca$h. The Afrobeats track produced by Skool Beatz flaunts the duo’s sharp lyricism and skilful wit. On this track, the two artistes spotlight the everyday ups and downs of relationships and how to cope when lied to. The rapper crossed paths with King Kanja through his father, BK Rube, the Brooklyn legend of the Notorious BIG’s Junior Mafia, and Grammy award-winning R&B/Soul legend Faith Evans. In a statement, he said he anticipated coming back to Kenya and connecting with family and friends. "Nothing, absolutely nothing and nowhere feels like home.”
