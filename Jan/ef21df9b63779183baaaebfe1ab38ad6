The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has warned the Salaries and Remuneration Commission against touching their allowances. They said SRC’s interference with members’ allowances could result in them going ahead with their previously proposed strike. Two weeks ago, the union and the state stroke a deal to suspend the nationwide strike. While speaking during a press conference in Naivasha on Saturday, they said that the SRC had plans to suspend some of their members’ allowances. Dr Davji Atellah, KMPDU Secretary General said they will not allow such unlawful action. “Non-practice allowance is an incentive and compensation to officers for the loss of earnings they forego while actively practising in the medical facilities and that is the rationale behind including the same in our CBA as a negotiable item,” he said. He said that their allowances are stipulated in their job contracts, saying removing them will result in a lack of motivation among the medical fraternity. “There will be dire consequences in the health sector,” he said. Atellah said it was unconstitutional of SRC to issue new guidelines to employers to remove doctors’ contractual earnings and remuneration without consulting them. Abidan Mwachi, KMPDU Chair, said SRC sought to cut their salaries by half and they would not allow it. “Doctors work under harsh conditions and it’s our right to get these allowances. We will not sit back as they do this,” he said He said they were ready to forego the deal they made with the state to suspend the strike.
