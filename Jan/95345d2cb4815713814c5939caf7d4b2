Cristiano Ronaldo made his competitive debut for new club Al Nassr in their 1-0 win over Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League on Sunday. The 37-year-old Portugal forward joined the club last month on a deal that runs until 2025, reportedly earning more than Â£177m per year. He led the line and played the entire game in which Brazilian midfielder Talisca scored the winner. Al Nassr are top of the Saudi league, a point above second-placed Al Hilal. Ronaldo - who has played for Manchester United, Juventus, and Real Madrid - was greeted by banners and cheers from his adoring fans at King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh. It comes after he scored twice in Riyadh All-Star XI's 5-4 defeat by Lionel Messi's Paris St-Germain in an exhibition match on Thursday.
