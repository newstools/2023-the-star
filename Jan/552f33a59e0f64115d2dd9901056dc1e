Another 2022 KCSE graduate has credited her good performance in mathematics to Embakasi East MP Babu Owino's online classes. The girl who said her name is Aggy communicated her appreciation in a video posted online in which she said prior to the MP's intervention, her performance in the subject was poor. "I was so weak in mathematics, getting D-, D constant. I decided to attend Babu Owino's classes and from those classes, I learnt a lot," she said. "I want to congratulate Babu Owino, he helped me a lot with doing practice, Like I attained a C+ all the way from a D constant, D-, D pluses and even getting an E. "Actually, I'm so happy, so happy," Aggy said and encouraged the youthful MP to continue with the classes saying many have benefitted from them. The MP acknowledged the appreciation message saying doing good to people makes one feel good. "Better than the house you live in, better than the car you drive and better than the bed you sleep on. Education breeds confidence, confidence breeds hope and hope breeds peace. Congratulations on passing exams," Babu said. This was the second time a KCSE candidate went public and acknowledged that the youthful legislator's online coaching helped them perform better in the 2022 KCSE exams. Babu started administering the online classes at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and in the middle of a lockdown that saw schools close for nine months. In December last year, a boy in Mandera who scored 370 marks in the KCPE exams gifted the MP a camel. Abdiqani Mohamed from Alluta Integrated Academy attributed his great performance to the online classes the MP was conducting for students. “I am very grateful to honourable Babu Owino. Before I joined his online classes, I was not performing well and my expectations were low,” Mohamed said in a heartfelt video message shared by the MP.
