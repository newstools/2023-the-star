Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has appointed 26-year-old Caroline Njoki Maina as a member of the Kenya Ports Authority board. Sources say Njoki was a key participant during the campaign of President Wiliam Ruto before and during the August 9 general elections. If her Twitter bio is anything to go by, she says she is a loyal member of the ruling party, UDA. "Loyal member of the ruling party UDA," her Twitter bio reads. Other members of the board are Musa Osman, Emmanuel Kibet, Consolata Lusweti and Lucas Maitha. Through a gazette notice dated January 20, 203, Murkomen said the changes take place with immediate effect. They will serve for a period of three years. Dennis Itumbi congratulated her on her appointment, saying he has no I doubt she will deliver. "Congratulations Njoki - your appointment to the board of KPA at 26 is the stuff that deserves ink on many more chapters. I have watched you work and I have no doubt you will deliver. I liked that you had an easier path, but you chose the unchartered waters. Very Proud," he said.
