Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy has been found not guilty of six counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. Jurors could not reach verdicts on one count of rape and one of attempted rape, following a six-month trial at Chester Crown Court. The prosecution sought a retrial on those counts and it has been scheduled for June 26. Louis Saha Matturie, 41, was also found not guilty of three counts of rape. Jurors failed to reach verdicts on three counts of rape and three counts of sexual assault against him. Mendy and his friend Matturie had been accused of raping and assaulting women at the player’s home in Prestbury, Cheshire, and at a Manchester flat. Prosecutors told the jury Mendy was a “predator” who turned the pursuit of women for sex into a game. But jurors were also told by defence lawyers that while the trial, involving money, sex, and celebrity, had “all the makings of a good drama”, it came with a significant “plot twist”— that the accused were innocent. Mendy covered his face with both hands as the jury foreman repeated “not guilty” to the six counts, which related to four young women or teenagers. The unanimous verdicts were delivered on Wednesday by the seven men and four women on the jury, one juror having been discharged earlier for medical reasons. The verdicts could not be reported until jurors concluded considering the remaining two counts, after they were given a majority direction by Judge Steven Everett, meaning he would accept a 10-1 majority on any verdict.
