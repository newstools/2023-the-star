Kenya Police coach Patrick Mugambi wants his charges to win their remaining four matches in the men's Kenya Hockey Union Premier League to stand a chance of gracing the African Club Championships. The free-falling law enforcers have won just once in their last five matches — an outcome the gaffer insists does not augur well with the team's ambitions. The inconsistent run allowed Western Jaguars to pip them to second place after stringing six consecutive wins. The second slot, which guarantees the holders a chance to play at the Africa Club Championships, is Jaguars' to lose after opening up a seven-point gap over third-placed Police while Butali remain favourites for the title. "The three draws we registered affected us. Losing 2-0 to Jaguars was a bitter pill to swallow but we had to take it on the chin," said Mugambi. "Missing a penalty flick in that match was our downfall since, had we scored, we would have tilted the game to our favour." "We have always bounced back strongly. The boys have recharged over the holidays and they will be in peak condition when we play Parkroad this weekend." "We hope to win all our matches and pray that Jaguars draw at least one game." Police, former champions, are still without Oliver Echenje — who is attending a Poilce course — and Sammy Oungo who is recovering from a finger fracture that has kept him out of action since September. "This could perhaps be our worst season because of the injuries and absence of players due to personal commitments. We also need to improve our finishing," he concluded.
