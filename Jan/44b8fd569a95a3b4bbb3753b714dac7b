Kiambu Senator Karungo wa Thangwa has urged Governor Kimani Wamatangi to dialogue with Kiambu MCAs to cool off the political temperature in the county. Thangwa was reacting to a Monday incident where MCAs protested outside the governor's office. “Why would you (governor) not hear out the MCAs? They want an audience with you so that they can be given answers for the questions the electorate is asking them,” Thangwa said. Thangwa thanked the MCAs for not rushing to threaten the governor with impeachment. "As a leader, you get a lot of questions from the people that need urgent answers and the governor is the one to answer since he is in charge of county funds,” Thangwa said. The senator further warned the governor that when political heat in the county rises it will hinder development and service delivery. “Accept to sit down with the MCAs and come up with amicable solutions to propel Kiambu to greater heights and end the looming impasse," Thangwa said. "Do not let political heat because when it starts it will not end soon." He further said that he will also join the MCAs to camp at the governor’s office to seek for answers on various issues. “If answers are not provided soon the electorate will storm the governor’s office and we do not want the situation to escalate to that,” Thangwa said. “Let us not reach a situation where everybody is complaining over leadership. Let us work for our people so that we can deliver what we promised during the campaigns."
