Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance leader Raila Odinga has insisted that their planned Jacaranda rally is still on. In a tweet on Saturday, the former Prime minister said he will not be intimidated by anyone. He told his supporters that they meet at the Jacaranda grounds on Sunday, for the rally dubbed "No Handshake". This comes after President William Ruto on Friday said that he will not let Azimio rallies distract him from delivering to Kenyans. Ruto said that Azimio leaders are taking advantage of Kenyans by asking them to attend rallies while their children are in Arusha and Europe. "I want to ask you that you have taken your children to parliament in Arusha and others inÂ  Europe and then children who belong to Kenyans you want to take them to Jacaranda and Kamukunji, what do you take Kenyans for?" He said. "I will not accept other people to distract me to plan their things and leave the work I am supposed to do for Kenyans. That one I will not do. We should agree on this early." Ruto said what they are doing is part of the process of their long game to remain relevant as they wait to try their luck at the top office. Raila held a rally on Monday at Kamukunji where he said that he does not recognise Ruto as the president.
