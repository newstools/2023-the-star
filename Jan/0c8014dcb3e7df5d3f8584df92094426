Kakamega County clergies have been urged to remain non-partisan on political matters and instead support efforts to preach peace and tranquillity in the county. Addressing an interdenominational prayer event at Golf Hotel Kakamega on Monday, Kakamega governor Fernandes Barasa observed that the county had witnessed peace and calm during and after the elections last year in August adding that there is a need for all partners to keep it that way. The interfaith meeting resolved to collaborate with the county government in fostering development in the region and promised to remain nonpartisan, especially in political matters. Barasa instead called on the clergy to up their prayers for the county executive and the county assembly to serve the residents effectively. He reiterated that his administration will operationalize the County Chaplaincy and equally work closely with the interfaith secretariat to enhance development and performance in faith-based learning institutions across the County. “Peace is precious and that’s why we are here. The peace we have experienced throughout the electioneering period up to date must remain so. Let's focus on developing this county. Prayers up for the county executive and assembly to serve our people better," said Barasa. The prayer meeting was coordinated by the county secretary and Head of Public Service Bonface Okoth and attended by leaders among them Members of the County Assembly led by Deputy Speaker Benard Shitiabayi.
