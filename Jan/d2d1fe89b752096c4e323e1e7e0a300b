St John Priory of Kenya officials have urged the Ministry of Health to train boda boda riders as Emergency First Responders. This comes after a meeting between Health CS Susan Nakhumicha on Wednesday with the council of St John Priory in a bid to discuss areas of cooperation. The St John Priory delegation was led by their chairperson Paul Ndung'u and CEO Haron Gikeria. Gikeria urged the Ministry of Health to initiate the process of training 200,000 boda boda riders as Emergency First Responders. He also urged the ministry to ensure all boda boda riders across the country receive medical cover through NHIF. Nakhumicha said the Health ministry will continue facilitating training of volunteers from St John on community health before co-opting them into CHV’s. "The ministry will also support St John in replenishing emergency stocks across their various rescue centres and examining and certifying St John trainees undertaking EMT," Nakhumicha said. The CS said St John Ambulance has been a key partner of the Ministry of Health. She said the society provides emergency medical care to the sick and wounded as well as promoting charitable works. Nakhumicha said the society has been instrumental in reducing human suffering.
