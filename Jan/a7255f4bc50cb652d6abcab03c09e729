The Kenya National Basketball League will resume on January 21, competition secretary, Joseph Amoko has revealed. The league took a break mid last month, few weeks after the start of the second leg fixtures. While notifying the teams, Amoko said he was working on the fixtures which will be released to the teams in due course. Five teams including Kenya Ports Authority, Thunder, Ulinzi Warriors, Equity Bank and Strathmore University are all battling for a top-four finish. The regular season will then give room for the play-offs, which will determine the winners in all the five categories. Meanwhile, status quo was the order of the day at the Kenya Basketball Referees Association (KBRA) elections. Fred Awuor retained his position as the chairman following the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held at the Jamhuri High School on Saturday. Others are first vice chairman David Maina, second vice Eric Omondi, secretary Abbas Ulaya, assistant secretary Dyna Mayaka, and treasurer Carol Ouma. Co-opted/committee members from the polls, overseen by former Kenya Basketball Federation vice chairman Henry Shihemi, are Thomas Mutuku, Maurice Omondi and Hazel Agina.
