National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung'wa has termed Monday's rally by the opposition as diversionary and testimony of panic. The Kikuyu MP who is currently abroad on official duties warned that the rally at Kamukunji by opposition leader Raila Odinga is meant to distract Kenyans. "It’s diversionary. The panic buttons are too many," Ichung'wa said of Raila's latest political moves. The MP said the decision to hold public gatherings are meant to distract Kenyans from the expected testimony by the former IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati. Chebukati could appear before the tribunal investigating the commissioners of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. "So now I hear Tinga wants to land,onto a rally at Kamukunji from wherever.Before I also land back from wherever,just wondering,Is it really Tinga or the Puppeteer who wants a distraction away from Chebukati's testimony at the tribunal?" Ichung'wa posed. Raila on Saturday said he will on Monday hold a mega rally at Nairobi's Kamukunji to respond to the alleged dossier on the rigging of the August 9 polls. The opposition leader is currently on South Africa. He is expected to respond to claims by an alleged IEBC insider who outlined how Raila allegedly won the presidential contest against President William Ruto who was declared the winner.
