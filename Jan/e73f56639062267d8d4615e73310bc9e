Chief Justice Martha Koome on Monday oversaw the swearing-in of the members of the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA). At the same time, retired Chief Justice David Maraga was sworn in as chairperson of a task force that will oversee reforms at the National Police Service and Kenya Prisons Service. Also sworn in were 22 other members of the task force, which is mandated to identify the constraints on effective service delivery by NPS and KPS. During the ceremony, Koome said CRA is a major facilitator of the realisation of the dream of establishing a “fair and just State that is embodied in the Constitution”. CRA’s principal mandate is to make recommendations on sharing of revenue collected nationally between the national and county governments.
