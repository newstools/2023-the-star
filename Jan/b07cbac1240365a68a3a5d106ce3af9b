Plans to construct an interchange at the Ngong Road-Naivasha Road interchange have gotten underway following the signing of a deal for the project. The construction, whose commencement is yet to be revealed, will be undertaken by the Spanish construction company Centunion. The Kenya Urban Roads Authority on Monday signed an Sh3.2 billion concessional loan for the project. "KURA has today signed Sh3.2 billion concessional loan with Centunion of Spain for the design and construction of Ngong Road-Naivasha Road interchange. The signing was witnessed by CS-Transport, Hon. Kipchumba Murkomen and PS-Roads, Eng. Joseph Mbugua," KURA said in a tweet. Centunion is the same company that undertook the contract to construct the four-lane fly-over on Langata Road and several footbridges at a cost of Sh3.13 billion in 2020 to ease transportation along the highway. The project which took three years to complete was financed through a bilateral financial agreement between Spain and Kenya. It included the fly-over at the T-Mall and related footbridges across Mbagathi Way and at Nyayo Stadium. KeNHA Director-General Peter Mundinia said the project was part of an integrated programme to ease traffic congestion, increase pedestrian security and improve traffic flow on Langata road. "The project is being implemented under Engineering Procurement and Construction/Turnkey Contract framework and was signed between KeNHA and the contractor, Ms Centunion Espanol de CoordinationTecnica Y Financiera. S.A of Spain at a contract sum of â‚¬23,250,000 and with timely completion of 36 months," Mundinia said in a statement on the agency's Twitter handle.
