A murder suspect allegedly committed suicide at the Kayole police cells in Nairobi. Richard Kioko is said to have hanged himself using a t-shirt. His body was discovered on Tuesday morning as police on duty conducted a roll call. Kioko had been booked at the station on December 30, and was being held pending further probe. Police said the deceased was being held in a separate cell alone after he had turned violent against other suspects. Officers who visited the scene said he hanged himself on the ventilation grills using his t-shirt. Nairobi police boss Adamson Bungei said they are yet to know the motive of the incident. He said they are investigating the incident. The body was moved to the mortuary. Other suspects who were being held in the cells said they don't know what happened as the deceased was moved to a separate cell. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority said they are investigating the incident to take appropriate action. The agency is mandated by law to investigate such incidents and make recommendations to the Office of Director of Public Prosecution. Officials want to ascertain the possibility that the man died by suicide using a t-shirt or whether police negligence is to blame. Such incidents have been on the rise in some stations in the city amid probe.
