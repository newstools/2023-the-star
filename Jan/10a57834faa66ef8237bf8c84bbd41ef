The national championships is set for January 21 at Prisons Staff Training College, Ruiru. Kiyaka, an experienced mountain runner clocked 36:42.41 to win the title during the race held at Kisumu National Polytechnic on Saturday. “I have been to the nationals twice but I did not do well. However, this time I want to perform better and maybe finish in the top 10,” said Kiyaka, who trains in Nyamira County. “I did not post a good time here because the competition was not stiff and the course was not good because the grass was tall. It was also too hot. I wish we ran this race at 9 am.” Kiyaka, 33, said he is also looking forward to the mountain running season. The diminutive led from gun to tape to beat Bernard Bii (37:12.93) to second place while Victor Otieno (37:44.61) completed the podium finish.  Brian Otieno was fourth (38:51.21) and Evans Omandi fifth (41:31.62).

Immaculate Akinyi bagged the junior women’s 6km race in 31:59.05 followed by Yvonne Awino ( 34:04.63 ) and Emily Achieng ( 34:10.98). Athletics Kenya Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng said they will send a lean to Nairobi for the national championships. “In some races especially senior women, we are not fielding athletes because they posted poor time. However, in the junior category we shall take more athletes to give them exposure,” said Ochieng. Ochieng at the same time said he was impressed by ongoing renovation works at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. He said they are even contemplating moving the first Athletics Kenya track and field weekend meeting from Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology to Kisumu.
