Health CS Susan Nakhumicha has said that there is no condom shortage in the country. Speaking with Nation on Wednesday, the CS said that the country has 38 million pieces of condoms. "I would like to clarify to Kenyans that we do not have a shortage of condoms in the country," she said. "As of this morning we have 38 million pieces of condoms. In relation to the population of Kenyans, you can see we are overstocked depending on how many are used at a go. We have sufficient quantities." The CS says that condoms are available but the challenge is how to get them to Kenyans. "We have the challenge because of the process that a health facility, and dispensary have to request for condoms by consolidating their orders to the county and then we get one order from the county which is sent to Kemsa," she said. She added that there is a lapse in terms of managing the process of condom requests. The CS also said that the government has inspected the quality of condoms. She said that 38 million pieces have been confirmed to be of good quality and ready for use. She urged Kenyans not to be worried because condoms are available.
