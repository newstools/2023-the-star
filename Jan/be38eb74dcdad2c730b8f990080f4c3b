The action at the 2023 Magical Kenya Ladies Open is set to tee off on Wednesday at the par-72 PGA Baobab course at Vipingo Ridge, with the Pro-Am tournament taking centre stage. The Pro-Am, which has attracted a field of 152 players including 74 professionals, begins at 7am. 24-year-old Ana Pelaez Trivino of Spain, defending champion Esther Henseleit and Pia Babnik— the highest-ranked player at the Magical Kenya Ladies Open, are set to be the main attractions among the professionals. Avani Prashanth of India, who is ranked 96th on the World Amateur rankings, and the Kenyan duo of fast-rising juniors Mariam Mwakitawa and Rohini Shah will also be on the course. Former Kenya Sevens rugby star Lavin Asego will also be competing, having made the switch from the rugby pitch to the golf course five years ago. U.COM Event Managing Director Dirk Glittenberg said: “The Pro-Am is a great opportunity for the professionals to get a last feel of the course before the tournament tees off. It is also a great chance for the amateurs to measure up their game against the professionals. We have a very exciting mix for this year’s event, which should set the stage for a great week of golf.” The main tournament is set for Thursday with a field of 96 players, including six amateurs. The full field will play for two days before the cut, which will determine the players to play through the weekend to crown the 2023 Magical Kenya Open Ladies winner on Sunday.
