Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mithika Linturi on Wednesday launched the Training of Trainers of Assistant County Commissioners. The event that took place at Kenya School of Government, Lower Kabete will see farmers register in the government subsidy fertiliser scheme. Interior Principal secretary Raymond Omollo had graced the event. Omollo said the exercise will be voluntary and urged NGAOs to uphold inclusivity, integrity and fairness throughout the registration process. During the month-long exercise, fertiliser will be distributed to registered farmers ahead of the planting season. Omollo said no one will be coerced into giving their personal details when the process begins. Issuing a stern warning to the national government administrative officers who will participate in the process, the PS told them to act diligently and avoid misusing the information for other purposes or gains. "Registration is free and we shall be decisive on dereliction of duty by any of our officers," he said.
