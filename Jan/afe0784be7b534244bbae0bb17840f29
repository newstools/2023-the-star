West Mugirango MP Stephen Mogaka on Monday launched an online application platform for bursaries to improve access to education funding for students in secondary schools and colleges. Speaking during the launch at the NGCDF office in Nyamira town, he said he is determined to ensure no student remains at home due to lack of school fees. “It is the role of the national government to ensure students are in school. As the representative of the national government at the constituency level, I'm working towards fulfilling the needs of the needy in society to get education,” Mogaka said. The MP said education was among his priorities in the constituency and he is working towards achieving his target by ensuring all students get support to fulfil their dreams. “I'm focusing on every student in this constituency, more so those from humble backgrounds to ensure nothing hinders them from accessing education,” he said. Nyamira South subcounty deputy county commissioner Florence Obunga said the government will take stern action against any parent found keeping children of schoolgoing age at home. She said every child has a right to education and parents should take advantage of the free education to ensure children go to school. “We will move from house to house now that schools are reopening next week to ensure no child is at home. If we find any child at home who is supposed to be in school then the parents will be held responsible for the offence and action will be taken against them,” Obunga warned.
