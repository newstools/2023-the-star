Gor Mahia head coach, Jonathan McKinistry, has urged his players to keep their winning mentality going as they eye their 20th Kenyan Premier League title this season. McKinistry spoke after the record Kenyan champions thrashed Talanta 3-0 at Moi Stadium, Kasarani to go third in the standings and keep their title hopes alive. Joshua Onyango put Gor ahead in the ninth minute while Benson Omalla doubled the lead ten minutes later. On the stroke of halftime, Talanta's fate was sealed by quick-footed offensive midfielder John Macharia. "The boys gave their all this afternoon, and we are pleased that we were able to secure a big win that has put us back in contention," McKinistry said. The former Uganda Cranes and Amavubi Warriors tactician warned their bitter rivals AFC Leopards that K'Ogalo will not settle for anything less than a win on Sunday. "This result has provided significant motivation to the squad as they prepare to face AFC Leopards in our next league match on Sunday." McKinistry urged the massive Green Army fan base to turn out in force and fill the Nyayo Stadium stands to the brim. "We will be out there not only to look for victory but also to entertain our fans with spectacular football. Our fans have given us the motivation we need to continue this season, and we need them to cheer us on during the Mashemeji derby." Talanta head coach Ken Kenyatta attributed their loss to laxity. “We need to be consistent in the league if we expect to register any meaningful results. We fell short of expectations this afternoon. The departments were disjointed. “All in all, we live to fight another day. We are going back to the training immediately to amend our shortcomings before our next fixture."
