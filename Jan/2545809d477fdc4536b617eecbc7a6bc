The government is committed to exploiting the full potential of the Kisumu port, President William Ruto has said. The President noted that the Port stands to change the economic fortunes of the East African region. Ruto spoke when he met the Kisumu county leadership led by Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyongâ€™o and his deputy Mathew's Owili. The President said they discussed the development of the port. While on his tour of the Port on Saturday morning before heading to Siaya, the President inspected the construction of the Wagon Ferry. The Wagon Ferry and the Kisumu Shipyard which he commissioned, he said, will enhance transport and facilitate cross-border trade in the East African region. "This will have a catalytic effect on the growth of the economy and the generation of jobs in our country." Already, the renovation of the MV Uhuru I linkspan is at an advanced stage. It is an important installation that allows for the loading and unloading of wagons. The Kisumu Shipyard Limited continues to offer new build, maintenance, repair and overhaul of marine vessels for ministries, departments and agencies and private and public clients. On August 2, 2022, former President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the Kisumu Shipyard Limited at Kisumu Pier. During that period, he also officially oversaw the floatation of the MV Uhuru II ship which was nearing completion. The Sh2.4 billion vessel with a capacity of 1,800 tonnes was being built by Kenyan agencies, including the KDF, in partnership with Dutch firm Damen Shipyards. This was the first ship to be constructed and locally assembled in the country and elevated Kenya to great milestones as it positions itself to tap into the potential of Lake transport and the blue economy. The ship will complement the old MV Uhuru 1 built in 1966, which currently ferries mainly petroleum products to Uganda. MV Uhuru 1 has a capacity of 1,260 tonnes.
