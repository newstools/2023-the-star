The incident captured in a viral video showing a girl being clobbered by a group of men did not happen in Kenya. Many Kenyans have been circulating the video on social media claiming that it happened in Migori county among the Kuria community. Among those who shared the video is former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko who claimed he had dispatched a team of lawyers to act on the matter. The Star fact check desk has however established that the video did not happen in Kenya. The iVerify Network of Fact-Checking Desks reported that the young lady was being clobbered by the Mayi-Mayi Malaïka militias of the  Maniema province in the east of DRC. The report said the girl was being attacked for wearing too-short skirts but not FGM as widely claimed. The militiamen have a reproach for women in short dresses and skirts, Iverify indicated. The militia mainly operates in the territory of Kabambare, which includes the district of Salamabila.
