Patrick Musyoka is a troubled man after his wife and son were brutally murdered. Musyoka said his wife was hacked with a panga at their Nguutani home on October 1, last year. A month later, his 20-year-old son was also killed. "It is someone well known to us and is doing this because he is monied and has vast connections," Musyoka said. The man who has been hospitalised for some months now says his life is also in danger stating he has been threatened severally that once he gets well, he will be next. Musyoka said no single suspect has been arrested following the two incidences. "We gave police officer names of the suspects but not even a single one has been arrested," he said. He called on the DCI to step in and help in investigations as his life and that of his other children are in danger. The eldest daughter said a neighbour had told her mother that there were people after her son days before she was murdered. "My father's relatives hate us so much. We are no longer happy in our land, we are viewed as outsiders," she said Musyoka Kaloki, a brother-in-law accused police of laxity pleading with the national government to intervene. Contacted for a comment, Migwani OCPD,Kazungu Charo said he is on leave but will follow up with the matter.
