The High court has temporarily suspended the implementation of Sh350 million Mandera county Bursary fund program dubbed 'Elimu kwa Wote Initiative'. Lady Justice Hedwig Ong'undi issued the order following a case filed by a Mandera resident-Abdullahi Mohammed Ahmed. The Judge said the order will be in force until February 2 when the matter will be mentioned. She however transferred the file to Garissa High Court. Ahmed in his court papers says there wa no budget allocation for the program launched on January 116 this year. "..and if there is any the same did not comply with article 10 of the constitution on public participation before the same is approved." The purpose of the initiative he says is to pay tuition fees for all students in the 59 government secondary schools within Mandera county, a role already being played by the national government. He has also termed the program as discriminative as theÂ  county intends to implement it in line with tribal lines as the majority tribe will get more funds than the minority tribe
