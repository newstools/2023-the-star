The High Court has blocked a petition to have Safaricom stopped from having their customer loyalty points commonly known as Bonga points, expire. The petition by Dr Magare Gikenyi, a Nakuru-based surgeon, sought to stop Safaricom’s decision to put an expiry date to Bonga points starting January 1. Dr Gikenyi said the decision was reached without input from subscribers. “The action of Safaricom will affect over 40 million Safaricom subscribers and over Sh4.5 billion worth of Bonga points are going to be lost by January 1,” he had said. “Considering the verse geographical background of Kenya, high illiteracy level in some parts of the country, lack of internet in some areas and many other factors, many Kenyans will suffer due to the poor administrative action of the respondents,” he added. The petition filed on December 30 last says that the announcement caught the public unaware. However, High Court Justice Mugure Thande declined his request to stop Safaricom from issuing the expiry date on Bonga points. He noted that the petition was filed at the last minute. “The petition and application which have been filed at the very last minute be served upon all parties by January 16 and be mentioned for directions on March 6,” he said.
