Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has urged Mt Kenya residents to be satisfied with the positions that President William Ruto has given the region. Gachagua spoke on Sunday during an interdenominational church service held at Nanyuki Stadium. He said a good number of seats have already been allocated to the region. “We have been given something. Let us be contented with the little we have got. Mr President, I am grateful for the seats you have given us,” the DP said. Gachagua urged the residents to remain calm and avoid complaining about the recent allocation of government positions. He said there has been an uproar about the many seats given to the region. “Let’s not shout much, we will miss other seats, you heard that the President had been taken to court because of giving us many seats. So let's accept to be given in little portions. A man reaps what he sows,” he said. Last month, the DP commended his boss for honouring the agreement they had when forming the Kenya Kwanza Coalition. Speaking to residents of Nyandarua during a function, Gachagua said the President had allocated various Cabinet positions to the region as promised. "When we were forming a coalition with Ruto, we told him we will give him all the votes, but when he wins, he will give us jobs and government positions," he said. Gachagua said Ruto is a gentleman as he has kept his promise. He further assured residents that President Ruto is committed to rewarding the region with more positions in the future. "He has given us many ministers and principal secretaries and others are still to come. You will hear about Njeri, Wahito, Kamau, Ndiang'ui, Muchiri.. where is the problem?. You will hear it announced," the DP said. Last September, there was a huge uproar after Ruto picked at least seven Cabinet secretaries from the Mt Kenya region. The Mt Kenya and Rift Valley regions also dominated the list of PS nominees back in November.
