Knut Tharaka Nithi branch secretary Njeru Mutani has said the government should employ teachers according to shortage. He said the uniform allocation of the 30,000 tutors by the Teachers Service Commission will disadvantage some regions. Mutani  spoke to the star on Tuesday at his office in Chuka, Tharaka Nithi. "The only hitch in the employment is they are employing uniformly instead of employing according to the understaffing. For instance the level of understaffing in Tharaka Nithi is not similar to other counties," Mutani said. He said Tharaka Nithi Primary School has an understaffing of 357 teachers and 655 in secondary. The official said the Kenya National Union of Teachers should have been included in the teachers employing committee for checks and balances. "We hope the interviews would be transparent in future and we would be included. We are the people who represent the teachers. We know the challenges teachers face and the affirmative action per area," he said. Mutani said in Tharaka Nithi, the previous recruitments they had were transparent. He also said teachers are uncomfortable with the current medical scheme. The official said teachers are covered by NHIF and AON. However, he said the AON cover expires in October. "We had requested that because of many issues with AON, we should be covered with a comprehensive or enhanced NHIF, which is superior than AON," Mutani said. He further urged the government through legislation to increase the allocation of medical insurance from Sh15 billion to Sh23 billion. "When the government was advertising for the tender for a comprehensive cover, NHIF asked for Sh23 billion. However, AON got the tender after it quoted Sh15 billion," the official said. "We are now requesting the government to add the deficit of Sh8 billion so that teachers can be comfortable with the medical scheme of NHIF."
