Police said that despite the efforts of emergency services, he was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed. Police, paramedics and air ambulance workers were all at the scene, as were about 25 firefighters. The telescopic urinal is close to the Palace Theatre, home to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Some roads in the area have been closed, with buses diverted. Closures are expected to remain in place for a number of hours, police at the scene said. A man died after he was crushed and trapped underneath a telescopic public urinal while working on the device in central London. He was pronounced dead at the scene at Cambridge Circus during a rescue effort at the junction between Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road. Pop-up toilets are stored beneath the ground and brought to street level at night for people to use. Emergency crews were sent to the scene at 13:05 GMT. Fire crews used a winch to free the man. He was released from the urinal by 15:40, London Fire Brigade said.
