Police in Kisumu have recovered five guns in the last month, county commissioner Josephine Ouko has said. Ouko said out of the recovered guns, three were Ak47, G3riffles while two others were pistols. She said an operation has already been launched to flash out the criminals, saying the culprits will not be spared. The commissioner said already 32 people have been arrested in connection with the criminal activities and presented in court. "We have also confiscated 28 motorbikes. They are currently being held by the police over suspicion that they were being used to commit crime," Ouko said. Speaking during a public Baraza at Nyamasaria, she called on the public to work with the police to ensure issues of crime are reduced. "This issue of insecurity within Kisumu East must come to an end, it's unfortunate that those terrorising residents are young boys aged 16 and below 25 years," she said. Ouko said they will strengthen community policing and Nyumba Kumi initiatives to tackle the insecurity problem. Residents appealed for the implementation of measures to address the rising cases of insecurity. They include the creation of more police posts in the area.
