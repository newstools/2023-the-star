Jubilee secretary general Jeremiah Kioni has said President William Ruto is uncertain of the powers he has as the president. Kioni was referringÂ to Ruto's claim on plot to kill former IEBC commissioner Wafula Chebukati at Bomas. Speaking on Wednesday, Kioni said confidential information shared with the President, whether accurate or not, should be processed by agencies responsible. "When the Head of State came out yesterday and said you wanted to murder this person. That is very scary," he said during an interview at Spice FM. "You would want him to inform the agencies to deal with the information he receives not come and say it. To me, he is a person who is not certain of the powers that he has." Kioni added that the President should be a source of hope for every Kenyan whether they voted for him or not. "When you move from being the source of hope for us and become an object of fear, it is like you are loosing the country," he said. Ruto had alleged of a plot to abduct, torture and kill Chebukati at the Bomas of Kenya. Ruto's sentiments elicited mixed reactions from a section of leaders and Kenyans. He said the plot was hatched by a political syndicate that was managing the presidential succession, as the ultimate move to force their preferred candidate on Kenyans. Ruto said Chebukati's assassination would then pave way to overturn the will of the people. "We all know there was a direct attempt to abduct Wafula Chebukati and murder him, so that the commission would be paralysed or a compliant commission takes over and subvert the people's sovereignty," he said. "It was a hard, cold and lonely time. The threats were dire, the promised rewards lavish and the pressure relentless." The President said the scheme was hatched a while earlier when senior politicians teamed up to manage the presidential succession that was due in 2022.
