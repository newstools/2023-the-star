Bunyore Starlets' coach Daniel Arunga wants his charges to be more clinical in attack after their goalless draw with Gaspo in the Women's Kenya Women's Premier League at Momboha grounds on Sunday. Both teams could not find a breakthrough after missing a penalty apiece. Priscah Ambale failed to convert from 12 yards for Bunyore while Diana Kosgei was equally a culprit for Gaspo from the spot. "We have to burn the midnight oil to ensure our attack functions like a well-oiled machineâ€”just like our midfield and defence," Arunga noted. "We face Kangemi next and we want to see an improvement. There's no way you can win matches without scoring. A point is a bonus considering we lost six points against Gaspo last season." His counterpart Mohamed Ibrahim lauded their opponent for their steely determination to prove a point. "Bunyore have come of age. We easily beat them last season but they have proved a tough nut to crack. It means there's something unique they are doing." "We had our moments while Bunyore also did well to keep my strikers at bay." Juliet Adibo, Pauline Musungu and Chris Kach were on target as Thika Queens cruised to a comfortable 3-0 win against Wadadia at Mumias Sports Complex. Thika coach Fred Majani commended his team for bouncing back to winning ways after coming short against Bunyore in the last encounter. "Going forward, the focus is on acquiring maximum points. However, there's no room for complacency," he said.
