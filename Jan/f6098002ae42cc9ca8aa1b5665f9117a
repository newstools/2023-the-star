After a successful Fight Night in Nairobi last Saturday, the organisers - Solid Rock Promotions - want to spread their wings to the grassroots in sech of raw talent. Solid Rock's Mike Odongo said the attendance at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre, featuring boxers from four countries, showed great promise and they feel challenged to stage more. On the short-term, Odongo said they are working with corporate companies to have an even bigger event in April in Nairobi. Odongo spoke as he received a cheque of Sh100,000 from betting company Betnare to be shared amongst four boxers to help them prepare for future bouts. The boxers to benefit from the donation are Lucien Botumbe, Bernard Oduor, Praxides Anyango and Vincent Ouma. Odongo said it is from the large turnout and good organisation witnessed at KICC that corporates are willing to embrace boxing and offer support to boxers. “We appreciate the goodwill from Betnare in donating Sh100,000 to the four boxers to help in their training and preparations. We, promoters, urge more corporates to come and support boxing from the grassroots level up,” Odongo said. It is estimated that over 2,500 fans attended last weekend’s event, the largest turnout in a boxing event in over a decade. Solid Rock is also looking at signing TV rights in future to have the boxing events broadcast live. The promotion company is alsi planning to hold a series of boxing events in different parts of the country to uplift the standards of the game. Lydia Njeri, the Betnare Public Relations representative said the company will work closely with Solid Rock and the Kenya Professional Boxing Commission in their mission. “Betnare is committed to bringing back the glory of boxing by continually supporting the sport down to the grassroots level,” said Njeri.
