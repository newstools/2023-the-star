Uganda President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has urged Ugandans to work hard before expecting a reward in 2023. In his New Year message, Museveni narrated one of his early life stories, reminding them that there was time for everything. "This year, let us put in equal effort in the work at hand before expecting an equal reward. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8. Happy New Year!" he said. The President recalled how at one point as a young boy, he "mixed" work with pleasure and how it cost him and his father. He said the only time he entered into a Court of Law, was in 1956, when, being attracted by a game of football, he joined the other boys to enjoy the sport, because he was a good footballer. He later discovered that the cattle he was herding had descended on another's "luscious" millet garden. "Running at full speed, I tried to save whatever was remaining of the millet. It was, however, too late," Museveni narrated. "I had committed the offence of okwonesa. From a layman's understanding, it means one’s livestock eating the crop of another citizen." Museveni said the temporary attraction to village football qualified him to appear before the Parish Court at Kikoni, under a mutooma tree – omutuba – ficus nantelensis – in one Mzee Katojo’s rutookye (banana plantation). He explained that there, he was coached to say: “omushaango ningwikyiriiza”, which means "I plead guilty to the charge". The President does not recall his trainer, who told him it was better for everybody for him to plead guilty. He adds that he thinks his father, Mzee Kaguta had to pay the millet owner some enkaitsi (compensation). "Hence, Bazukulu: there is time for everything”, a time to work and a time to play," he concluded the message.
