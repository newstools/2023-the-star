Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot has said that Azimio is taking the country in a dangerous direction. In a statement on Thursday, Aukot said that Azimio should find a better way of seeking justice. "The direction Azimio is taking is dangerous for the country. There are better ways of seeking justice. Incitement isn't one of them. UDA on the hand, must also now focus on delivery as per your plan," he said. This is after Azimio planned a series of rallies, one that happened on Monday at Kamukunji grounds and another one scheduled for Sunday, January 29. Azimio leader Raila Odinga announced that the Sunday rally to be held at Jakaranda grounds will be part of his build-up for his pushback against President William Ruto's government. "On Sunday we will hold a rally at Jakaranda, we have a right to speak to Kenyans, but if they want to jail us, we are even ready," Raila said. On Tuesday Makadara MP George Aladwa said the opposition coalition will push with its plans to fight for justice after 'stolen victory'. "The next few weeks will be decisive for the country, we shall not turn back," he told the Star. "We shall hold rallies in every corner of this country."
