The Kenya Rugby Union Championship resumes on Saturday after a three-week festive season break. The second-tier league took a break on December 17 for the Christmas and New Year festivities. On Saturday, leaders Nondescripts will seek to extend their winning run when they host Kabarak University as they seek a quick return to the Kenya Cup after falling under the axe last season. They have signalled their intention to return to Kenya Cup by signing five players among them Kenya Sevens ace Alvin Marube from Impala. Others are Bonface Ochieng and Ivan Chebo from Harlequins, Levis Ochieng from Homeboyz and Philemon Olang from Strathmore Leos. They remain unbeaten after four matches to amass 19 points, six better of challengers Kisumu RFC. Kisumu are set for showdown against Daystar Falcons. However, Falcons coach, Caleb Bosire had made a request to KRU to postpone the encounter. Kisumu also strengthened their team by signing five players. They raided fellow Championship side Kabarak University for Elmard Obiero, George Osiri and Carlos Magara. Caxton Aresi and Charles Odhiambo also joined the former Kenya Cup side from Eldoret and Nakuru respectively. In return, Kisumu lost Charles Osgood to Kenya Cup side Menengai Oilers. Former Kenya Cup side Impala welcome University of Eldoret as South Coast Pirates host Eldoret RFC. Last year’s semifinalists Shamas Rugby Foundation battle former Kenya Cup side Western Bulls. United States International University Africa’s Martials (USIU-A) will seek their first win of the season when they face Zetech University on Wednesday next week. Martials coach Tom Lagat said they agreed with Zetech to postpone the match since most universities are set to return to class on Monday.
