Nyandarua Governor Dr. Kiarie Badilsha has expressed optimism that county staff will clinch a number of trophies in various disciplines ahead of the 9th edition of the Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association (KICOSCA) games starting in Kisumu on Monday. While flagging off the Nyandarua team, Badilisha said the activities will provide county staff with an avenue to interact with others with the objective to enhance national cohesion, teamwork, talent development and benchmarking on best devolution practices. He said KICOSCA games have been instrumental for the county governments to network and share ideas for an enhanced relationship. On his part, his Deputy John Mathara noted that sports are not meant for leisure alone but also as a tool to transform lives and a driver for transformation in society. He added that there are a host of benefits in participating in games and exercise as they also contribute much towards body health. The leaders at the same time wished good luck to the Nyandarua team, affirming their support throughout the games. The county will be competing in 14 disciplines with the Nyandarua county football team expected to face Kisumu county in the opening match.
