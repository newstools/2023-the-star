Two-time Magical Kenya Ladies Open winner Esther Henseleit is hoping to make it three wins on the trot as she leads a strong field of 96 players for the 2023 edition at the PGA Baobab Course at Vipingo Ridge from  February 2-5. The 24-year-old German will be joined by Marta Sanz Barrio of Spain, Linnea Strom(Sweden) and Sophie Hausmann(Germany), who finished in the top five positions last year. Henseleit, who is the defending champion, said: “I’m looking forward to returning to Kenya and defending my title. It’s a special place for me because it’s where I won my first professional tournament and I’ve always found a great atmosphere with many friendly faces. A great way to start the season!” The Magical Kenya Ladies Open will have a prize fund of €300,000 and will be the first in a series of 39 events on the 2023 Ladies European Tour calendar – the most fixtures ever held on the Tour. Spectators will be encouraged to attend the four-day event and cheer on the professional players. The field will also feature five Kenyan golfers led by Naomi Wafula and Mercy Nyanchama who will be playing in their third tournament. Nancy Wairimu will be making her second appearance at Vipingo with Chanelle Wangari and Jacqueline Walter making their debuts. The action is set to kick off on Wednesday, February 1 with a Pro-Am tournament, before the field of 96 takes on the Vipingo Ridge course over four rounds, to crown the winner on Sunday 5th February. Spectators can purchase tickets to the four-day tournament through the online platform www.ticketsasa.com which retails for Sh500 per day.
