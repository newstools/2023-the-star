A policeman who was attacked by a gardener while on duty at President William Ruto’s Karen home has died. Corporal Timothy Mugendi Rucha died last week at the Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital (KUTRRH) from injuries he sustained during the attack last year, police said. He was physically assaulted by the gardener on July 21, 2022, and later admitted to the hospital. The officer has since been in hospital nursing the wounds. Police headquarters said they were informed of the death and the family is aware. Rucha was hit by the gardener on the rear part of the head with an object after the altercation turned physical. It is not clear what caused the altercation that went physical at the residence at the dead hour of the night. Ruto who was then a Deputy President was not present at the time of the incident but some of his family members were sleeping then. The gardener identified as Nicholas Kibiwot Rono was then arrested pending arraignment. Senior police officers visited the scene after they received a report of the said assault. Those who visited the officer from Security Government Buildings said he was in stable condition in the hospital then. He died months later. Police hoped to wait for the injured officer to recover and record his statement, and process his P3 form for the possible arraignment of the accused. The family of the deceased officer is seeking justice in the matter.
