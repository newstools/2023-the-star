A man was on Thursday morning killed by his neighbour for having an affair with his wife at Takitech village. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations said Julius Kipkurui, 42, knocked at the woman's door minutes past 3 am, calling her name, and asking her to open it. At the time, Kipkurui did not know that the woman's husband, who worked far from home, had arrived home on Wednesday. "Chero, yaat kurget, ane pepis neng’ung (Chero open the door, it’s me your babe) the voice continued," DCI said. The deceased's call woke the husband up, prompting a confrontation. The commotion attracted the intervention of the village Sub Chief and nyumba kumi elders who made moves to restore order. The victim, who was badly injured was rushed to Kapkatet hospital where he succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment. DCI said the wife fled the homestead to neighbouring farms. The husband has since been arrested and is currently held at Abossi police station.
