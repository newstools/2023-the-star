National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula has asked the Opposition to refrain from making fresh claims that August 9, 2022, presidential election was rigged. Wetang’ula said Kenyans have other issues that concern them and not last year’s elections. “I am asking those resurrecting the claims they won to go slow,” the National Assembly Speaker said. He said leaders claiming that Azimio leader Raila Odinga beat President William Ruto should give the government the space to serve Kenyans. “We want to move forward and meet the challenges of the day. We need to address the shortage of food, water and improve the productivity of farmers,” he said. Wetang’ula appealed to members of the clergy to pray for the country and make contributions to improve the welfare of Kenyans. “Continue to pray for the country. We did not fight after elections and those who were not contented went to court where the matter was decided,” he said. He spoke in Trans Nzoia during the episcopal ordination of Bishop Henry Juma Odonya of the Catholic Diocese of Kitale. Pope Francis appointed Odonya as the new bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Kitale in November 2022. Odonya is succeeding Bishop Maurice Anthony Crowley who retired after reaching the clerical mandatory age having held the position since 1998. President William Ruto, Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, Trans Nzoia governor George Natembeya and a hold of local and national leaders. Wetang’ula assured Odonya that he will get the support he needs from the government in executing his mandate. “You will enjoy our support so that you can have your work done. You are filling the shoes of a giant and I have no doubt that you will foot the bill,” he stated. He asked the new bishop to pay close attention to education and ensure schools get the right support.
