Chaos erupted in Kericho County Assembly after MCAs disagreed over House leadership. In a video clip that has since gone viral on social media, some Members of the County Assembly are seen attacking each other as others try to separate them. A lady is heard screaming as she topples over a chair while two men beside her are seemingly fighting. Another MCAs lifts a chair and throws it in the direction of the fight before the clip ends. The county assembly had held a special sitting to determine a new majority leader when the wrangles ensued. Barely four days ago, the house unveiled its leadership for the third time. On January 9, Kamasian MCA Philip Rono was elected Majority leader while Kapsuser member Peter Kemoi was named Majority Whip. This followed the stepping down of the second house leadership, following opposition and disagreements. Before them, the Majority leader was Londiani MCA Vincent Korir with the Whip being Haron Rotich. Their leadership was challenged as the MCAs voted in Kapsoit MCA Paul Chirchir and his Kisiara counterpart Gilbert Ngetich as Majority leader and whip respectively. This did not however stick as Deputy Speaker Eric Bett penned to UDA about the changes. Korir and Rotich were then reinstated. Speaking after the unveiling of Rono and Kemoi's leadership on Sunday, the Deputy Speaker said the House had agreed to end the wrangles. "We have agreed in a consensus with the majority that the two will represent us at the assembly. The leadership had been marred with wrangles and we do not want to go back there," Bett said. The two, who are now being challenged, were voted in by 27 out of 44 MCAs.
