Former nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura has said Kenyans lack integrity, especially those in politics. He said integrity is the quality of being honest and having strong values. Appearing in KTN's "We Debate", Mwaura, who was in the affirmative that Kenyans do not value integrity, said lack of integrity is one of the qualifications one needs to win an election in Kenya. "The best way to lose an election is to have high integrity. Not that which is pronounced publicly, but that which is done privately," he said. Acknowledging Chapter Six of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity, Mwaura said it has not been beneficial in persuading Kenyans to embrace virtue. "So, integrity in Kenya is a foreign concept," he said. Mwaura said Kenyans have been characterized by the fact that they are brought together to form a state but not a nation. In August 2022, Kenya ranked 128 out of 180, with a 30 on the Corruption Perceptions Index as of 2021. The performance was evaluated on a scale of 0-100, where zero meant highly corrupt and 100 very clean. Mwaura was debating against Amnesty International Kenya executive director Houghton Irungu. Irungu who has on the negative side said there was nothing hereditary about corruption. "We mustn't equate a disappointment, frightened and mistrustful population for a population that does not value integrity," he said.
