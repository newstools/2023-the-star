Prime CS Musalia Mudavadi has urged prosecutors to come up with technology driven ways of combating crime. He said the rule of law is critical for the country to function and can be more effective if coupled with tech-based approach. Speaking in Mombasa on Monday, Mudavadi said this will help expedite the war against various forms of crime. "The rule of law is absolutely critical for a country and region to function effectively. I encourage participants to take a keen look into, and develop workable approaches on how technology can be used to track and neutralise perpetrators of organised transnational crime and how to tackle money laundering across borders," he said. The Prime CS had accompanied President William Ruto at the 16th Annual General Meeting and Africa Prosecutorsâ€™ Association Conference in Mombasa. He also commend the leadership and membership of the Association for the consistency with which they have pursued continuous development of the prosecutorial discipline within Africa. This is the first time Kenya is hosting the conference, with participants from across 40 member states.
