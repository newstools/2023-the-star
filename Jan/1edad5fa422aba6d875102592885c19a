The United States Department has condemned violence against LGBTQ persons saying it is unacceptable. This comes after an LGBTQI+ activist Edwin Chiloba was murdered and his body stashed in a metallic box along the Kipenyo-Kaptinga road, in Kapsaret, Uasin Gishu. Speaking at a press conference, Department Spokesperson Ned Price said that the US is ready to assist in the investigations. "Violence against LGBTQI+ persons or anyone, of course, is unacceptable. But when violence stems from possible bias or stigma, it indirectly harms all members of the targeted community," he said. "The ultimate act of intolerance has no place in free and open societies. We urge and expect Kenyans to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation into his death. And of course, if there’s anything we can do to assist, we stand ready to do that." Price said that many people in Kenya benefited from Chiloba's leadership, visibility and support. Five suspects have been detained as part of a probe into the murder of Chiloba. Senior Principal Magistrate Richard Odenyo granted the police 21 days to hold the suspects to facilitate the completion of investigations. The five include Jackton Odhiambo who is the prime suspect alongside three minors. Odhiambo had sought to be released on bail, claiming that his family will not survive if he remains in custody. "I request to be released on bond so that I can continue with my work to support my family," he said. The case will be mentioned on January 31.
