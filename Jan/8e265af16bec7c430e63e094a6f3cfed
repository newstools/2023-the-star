Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua now says that political affiliations will not stop the Kenya Kwanza government from working with all elected leaders. Speaking on Saturday, Gachagua said the affiliations are only brought about by ideological differences and they will work with all leaders to solve challenges facing Kenyans. He insisted that Kenya can only develop through positive partnerships. "The Kenya Kwanza Government led by H.E President William Samoei Ruto is committed to working with all leaders to positively affect the lives of each and every Kenyan," he said. "Party affiliations brought about by ideological differences will not hinder us from seeking to partner with all elected leaders to find solutions to challenges currently facing Kenyans. Together and through positive partnerships, we will take Kenya to greater heights." The DP's remarks came on the third day of the ongoing Cabinet retreat and senior ranks of the Executive at the Fairmont Mt Kenya Safari Club in Nanyuki. The retreat is expected to continue for the next two days. Other than members of the Cabinet, advisers, Principal secretaries and Governor representatives also attended the retreat on Saturday. The president is also expected to hold a separate meeting with the leadership from the Senate and National Assembly. He will emphasise his agenda and explore ways in which the two Houses can work with his cabinet.
