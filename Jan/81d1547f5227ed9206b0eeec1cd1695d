Content creator Azziad Nasenya has distanced herself from an alleged intimate video. Through her Instagram page, Nasenya asked Kenyans to stop peddling fake news. Nasenya has on several occasions been a victim of cyberbullying. "I am grateful to my online family for coming forward and saying that is not me," she explained in a video. "We should not be in the business of creating false information around such topics because if you are spreading such information, then you are being an enabler to cyber bullying, which is not cool," she said in part. The talented dancer told her followers to embrace positivity. "Be happy about things that make you a better individual rather than rejoicing in things that make you feel they are going to lead to the downfall of another person," she said.
