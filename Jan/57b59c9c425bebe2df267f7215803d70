UDA Nairobi MCA has bashed Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja on the ongoing tiff between him and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. The Nairobi county assembly Minority leader Anthony Kiragu has said Sakaja was using politicians from the opposition to attack DP Gachagua. "It's unfortunate that our Governor has now started sideshows and using opposition leaders to attack the DP," he said on Tuesday. Kiragu claimed that Sakaja was "afraid" of directly attacking the DP because he knows UDA leaders will not accept. "Using other politicians to attack the DP is not only disrespect but also a sign of sideshows," he said. In addition, the minority leader is urging Sakaja to face Gachagua head-on and address the issues he has with him, instead of talking about it to the media. DP Gachagua and Sakaja have locked horns over the intended relocation of long-distance matatus from Nairobiâ€™s CBD to GreenPark Terminus. Sakaja said the move was to decongest the CBD as well as to restore sanity. However, Gachagua warned Sakaja against implementing the plan to relocate matatus. He termed the move as ill-intentioned, claiming it was aimed at persecuting the Mt Kenya business community, adding that it will disrupt businesses. Over the weekend, Gachagua asked matatu operators and other businesspeople to remain put and continue with their businesses assuring them of government protection. He cautioned Sakaja against removing public service vehicles from the CBD in a move to decongest the city. Pundits have said the war of words between the two leaders has little to do with matatus and traders' welfare but political interests. Sakaja said there is no bad blood between him and the Deputy President. The tiff has roped in politicians from the government and the opposition, where they have taken sides defending either Sakaja or Gachagua.
