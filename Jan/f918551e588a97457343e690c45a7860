Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has asked President William Ruto to be ready to "pack out of State House". The Azimio runningmate in the last presidential election said opposition Raila Odinga's victory was stolen in the last polls. "We are making one declaration here that William Ruto must go," Karua said as crowed roared back: 'Ruto must go'. Karua who spoke during an Azimio rally at Jacaranda grounds on Sunday warned President Ruto against insulting other leaders. 'We have seen him tryingÂ  to lecture us with insults, yet he is busy addressing his rallies," Karua said. "We are telling Ruto to stop trying to advise us, let him address his people and allow Baba to talk to his supporters." The Narc Kenya leader insisted that Raila was denied of his victory despite voters "voting overwhelming Azimio".
