Turkana county first lady Lilian Ekamasi now wants President Ruto to release petty offenders. Ekamasi said they should be considered for release. "Talk to your government, look at Lodwar police station and see to it that some petty offenders are released," Ekamasi said. The first lady said most of the prisoners have reformed after staying in prison. She spoke during the new year celebration with the prisoners. Ekamasi delivered several basic commodities to the prisoners. Lodwar has at least 800 prisoners. Former President Uhuru Kenyatta had pardoned 3,908 inmates who were serving sentences of less than three months. “I, therefore, direct that their sentences be commuted by the end of next week in full compliance with all legal procedures and processes,” he said during the 59th Madaraka Day fete. The release of petty offenders and inmates is also in cognisance of their probation report. The former President had then urged the pardoned inmates to be change-makers in society while also offering confidence in the criminal justice system. “Reciprocate the generosity of your motherland through this act of mercy with a high sense of civic duty and service to your country,” he said then. Uhuru's acceptance to pardon the inmates is a response to petitioners in the justice and legal sector. “In line with our commitment to restorative justice and reintegration of offenders; on the recommendation of the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee,” he said then.
