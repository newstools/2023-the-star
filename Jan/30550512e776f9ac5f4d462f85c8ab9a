There is a need to put interventions to address the issue of drug abuse in the country, Health CS Susan Wafula has said. Wafula on Monday said despite drug abuse fueling HIV infections in the country, it remains highly stigmatised. According to the CS, 26,673 of people who inject drugs in the country have received preventive and treatment services over the last eight years, with more than 4,000 clients currently in active follow-up. “We have allowed science to guide the response and design programmes, particularly for marginalised and vulnerable populations,” the CS said. “We have designed strategies and services that are stigma-free and responsive to the realities of clients and their families." People injecting drugs share needles and syringes leading to a rise in HIV infections, especially among the youth. According to experts, sharing needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment puts people at risk of getting or transmitting HIV and other infections. Data from the Ministry of Health shows that more than 1.1 million people living with HIV in Kenya are on Antiretroviral therapy with 73 per cent achieving viral suppression. More than 1.4 million people are living with HIV with about 10 per cent being children aged 0-14. The country has however, witnessed a 68 per cent reduction in new HIV infections and 57 per cent reduction in AIDS-related deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that HIV can survive in a used syringe for up to 42 days, depending on temperature and other factors. Substance use disorder has also been linked to risky sexual behavior and puts users at risk of getting viral hepatitis. Kenya started a programme dubbed Medically Assisted Therapy in 2014 to look at how to manage the large number of people who inject drugs in the country. The programme employs use of methadone as a harm reduction. There are 11 clinics in seven counties across the country that provide medication daily to this group.
