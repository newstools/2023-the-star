Former Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has praised the Nyanza region for embracing the government and lobbying for development in style. This is after President William Ruto on Friday made a visit to the Nyanza region. In a statement on Friday, Ngunjiri said that Nyanza has shown the country what unity means. "Today Nyanza has taken people to school about how lobbying for development projects is done and what unity of purpose looks like," he said. The President will tour different counties in Nyanza on Saturday also. Ruto has initiated some development projects which are aimed at opening up the region economically and improving the living standards of the residents. He said his administration will undertake the development in the region and other parts of Kenya as well regardless of how they voted in the last elections. Nyanza region is the home turf of Azimio leader Raila Odinga. Residents have been overwhelmingly voting for him the many times he has vied for the presidency. Ruto who competed with Raila in the last elections recalled that he got minimal votes from Nyanza and especially Homa Bay where he said he got only one per cent of votes. In the company of his Deputy Rigathi Gachagua, Ruto got a warm reception from residents and leaders in the county. Area leaders who received him included Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, Senator Moses Kajwang’, MPs Lilian Gogo, John Mbadi,  Millie Odhiambo, Ong’ondo Were and Eve Obara, Adipo Okuome and Caroli Omondi.
