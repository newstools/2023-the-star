Youth hockey team have stepped up preparation for the 4th edition of the Africa Youth Games slotted for the Easter Holidays in Congo, Brazzaville. With less than three months to go, the team of 12 in camp is on an intense training program to ensure the youth will be ready for duty by the time the competition serves off. The championship will also be a direct cast for the Youth Commonwealth Games to be staged in August. Speaking after a morning session, coach Kelvin Lugalia said: “Out of the 12 players, three of them have been in the past two editions so it’s a challenge to ensure there is compatibility." He added: "This camp has also helped athletes focus more with ease; no thinking of home nor their friends. It’s also a sensitive age group to deal with so I’m glad the Elite Development Commission is here.” The Coach believes once the camp is over, there will be continuity until they come together in April for another camp set just before they depart for the Games. “I’m in touch with coaches from all the schools where they study. I teach at St Anthony’s Kitale, the national coach Mike Malungu trains Musingu High school and the coaches at Maseno School and St. Charles.” Alex Maranka, 14, is elated to be part of the program. He said: “It’s been such a helpful camp and we’re been impacted with skills to help us in the future. Our aim is to join our brothers in the national team.” Lugalia is also in charge of the national men's hockey five-a-side team,  'Chui' who qualified for the 2024 World Cup, in Oman. The five-a-side  World Cup is a 16-team tournament that will be the first-ever in the Hockey5's format.
