Retired Chief Justice David Maraga on Thursday attended a Cabinet retreat hosted by President William Ruto at Mt Kenya Safari Club. It was not immediately clear under what position did Maraga attend the retreat for all Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and advisers. The Attorney General, the government's chief legal adviser, also attended the meeting that runs through Friday. The agenda of the retreat is to adopt the administration's economic transformation plan based on priorities of the Kenya Kwanza administration, dubbed 'The Plan' In December 2022, through a gazette notice, Ruto appointed Maraga to chair a 23-member task force whose main mandate is to oversee the improvement of reforms for members of the National Police Service and Kenya Prisons Service. In September 2022, Maraga also attended the swearing-in of six judges appointed by Ruto immediately after his inauguration. The six were recommended by Judicial Service Commission for an appointment but former President Uhuru Kenyatta refused to appoint them. The matter was a subject of a push and pull between Maraga and Uhuru with the former CJ at one time holding a press conference to castigate the president. Maraga's elevated role in Ruto's administration signifies their close ties. Initially, their were signals that Ruto and Maraga were not the best of buddies following the nullification of the presidential election in 2017.
