Foreign and Diaspora Affairs CS Alfred Mutua on Monday held talks with the Representative and Country Director of World Food Programme (WFP) Lauren Landis at his office in the Old Treasury building along Harambee Avenue. The two discussed and deliberated on issues of mutual importance to both Kenya and the World Food Programme, Kenya. "The deliberations centred on issues of food security, particularly in the context of the ongoing droughts in the region," Mutua said. In relation to the drought, CS Mutua said he informed Landis that the country was keen on mutually beneficial partnerships that would help alleviate extreme hunger. He also pointed out to the effective School Feeding Programme that had successfully transitioned into a Home-Grown School Meals Programme. "I pledged Foreign Affairs Office support to the object and purpose of World Food Programme," he said. On her part, Landis welcomed and lauded Kenyaâ€™s support of the work of Organisation's work. She further noted that Kenya had been a model for the rest of the continent in that respect. Landis committed to sharing information with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that would be vital in the workings of WFP Kenya in the country.
