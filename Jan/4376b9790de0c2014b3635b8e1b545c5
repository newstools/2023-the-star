Machakos governor Wavinya Ndeti has weighed in on the wrangles that have rocked Meru county. Ndeti in an interview on Citizen TV on Monday called on equal treatment of first husbands just the same way first ladies are treated. “….Let Kawira’s husband be accorded what he is supposed to be accorded just the same way first ladies are treated. Let them be accorded the respect and be facilitated the way they are supposed to be facilitated,” Ndeti said. She said it is unfortunate that men want female governors to treat their husbands differently from the way the male counterparts treat their first ladies. “If you look at Kawira, those men have a problem; someone has their first lady, and accords her all they want. Kawira has her husband, why would these men want to treat their women differently than the way we women will treat our husbands?” she paused. Last week, Mwangaza survived impeachment after the Senate rejected all charges levelled against her by the MCAs. Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, who chaired the special committee that investigated the charges last Friday said that none of the six charges and 62 grounds fronted against her were substantiated. "All the 11 members agreed and recommended to this house that all the charges were not proved or substantiated," Khalwale said. This implies that Kawira will continue with her duties as governor. Mwangaza was impeached on December 14, 2022 after 68 MCAs voted in favour of a motion sponsored by Abogeta MCA Denis Kiogora. She was accused of nepotism, illegal appointments, unlawful dismissal of the constitution and statutory functions of county organs. She denied all the allegations.
