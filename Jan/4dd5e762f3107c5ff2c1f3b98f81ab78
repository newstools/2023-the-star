President William Ruto has revealed his role in reforming Trade Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria. Ruto said that when he decided to work with Kuria he had a candid discussion with him about how he wanted him to reform. “If you look at Kuria today, his eyes are clear, I have reformed Moses Kuria,” the President said during the burial of Kuria's sister on Monday. “I sat down with Moses and told him you are a good man, but you have one problem, if you stop that then here is the pen that will employ you.” The President without speaking about the CS's previous alleged love for one too many, said Kuria promised to reform. “Kuria told me that if one of our friends, whom I can't name had reformed, then he would also reform,” Ruto said. "Kuria's wife and family are now happy he is now one of my best performing ministers,” the President remarked. The president a teetotaler, is said to have ordered his ministers to stop alcohol if they wanted to serve in his government.
