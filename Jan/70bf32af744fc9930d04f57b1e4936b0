Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has said Azimio's evidence that was suppressed by Supreme Court is now before the court of public. This comes as Azimio is holding a series of anti-President William Ruto rallies. Azimio leader Raila Odinga has led two rallies, the first one at Kamukunji on January 23 and another at Jacaranda on January 29. In a statement on Monday, Karua said that the court of public opinion is the highest court. "The evidence suppressed by the Supreme Court is now before the highest court, the court of public opinion," she said. After Ruto was declared the president-elect in the August 9, polls, Azimio filed a petition at the Supreme Court challenging  Ruto’s win but the petition was dismissed. Karua later moved to the East African Court of Justice seeking to overturn Ruto's  victory. The petition was filed at the Court's registry in Arusha, Tanzania on November 3. In a statement then, Karua and the Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) lobby maintained that both the Supreme Court and the IEBC failed Kenya's democracy and infringed on the human rights of Kenyans when they ratified Ruto's win. Raila has called for the resignation of Ruto saying he did not win the presidential election and that he is in office illegally. He said they have facts showing that he won the election. Raila claimed that a whistleblower who works for the IEBC had provided them with evidence that he won the election with more than 2 million votes but he was rigged out. The Directorate of Criminal Investigation has opened investigations into the alleged claims.
