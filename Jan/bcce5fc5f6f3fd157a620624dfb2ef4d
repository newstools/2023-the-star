A multi-agency team in Laikipia County on Friday recovered stolen livestock in Tiaty. The livestock had been stolen from a homestead in Loniek Area within Kirima Sub-County The National Police Service said the recovery was made after a heavy exchange of gunfire between the security team and the cattle rustlers at Chapelonin Area. "The livestock including nine cows and 18 goats have since been returned to the owner in the Loniek area," NPS said. NPS assured that the security teams remain committed to the fight against banditry and cattle rustling. This, the Service said, will ensure lasting peace in the affected areas. On January 8, President William Ruto said the government was going to deploy an additional 360 police reservists to the county. He said they will augment the efforts by security officers in seeking to end the rampant cattle rustling and banditry. "In the next few months, the reservists will be joining those already here because we want to control insecurity in the region," he said while speaking during an interdenominational service at Nanyuki Stadium. Several people have been killed and thousands of livestock stolen in the area. Also addressing the issue of banditry and cattle rustling, Interior CS Kithure Kindiki said the government is deploying a multi-faceted and multi-agency response. Speaking on January 3, he added that the government will pursue financiers and beneficiaries of the cattle rustling menace which has led to deaths and mass displacement of hundreds of citizens. "We are coming to dismantle not only the criminals themselves but also to bring down the entire chain that has been the cattle and livestock rustling industry," he said.
