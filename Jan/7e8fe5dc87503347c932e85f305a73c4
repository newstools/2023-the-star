University lecturers and researchers from the minority Kuria community in Migori county have formed an association to push for development in the area. Under the Kuria Dons Association, the group said they will hold a development conference later this year to check on the progress of the agenda. Migori deputy governor Dr Joseph Mahiri Gimunta, who was a lecturer at Kenyatta University before joining politics said the association has been an idea for a long time. “We realised most research findings gather dust in shelves instead of being used for development, we have a channel where we will work with scholars to spur development,” Gimunta said. Speaking in Kehancha town on Wednesday, Gimunta said they will push through research and donor mobilisation especially in education and health. “We will use what scholars have and translate it to development to aid the group,” he said, "We are keen to involve university lecturers in the development agendas of our community, after the formation of this association we will hold a development conference later this year to give impact on research done to aid the county," Mahiri said. In a memorandum, the group said they will also seek to mentor young scholars from the community and push through the establishment of a campus in the area by a university. The meeting was also attended by Prof Chacha Nyaigoti the chairman of the Commission of University Education and Professor George Chacha, the Vice Chancellor at Maasai Mara University among others. “Governments and institutions should rely more on research in pushing through an informed perspective in development, as researchers this association will give us a voice,” Nyaigoti said. He said research should never be gathering dust on shelves, but should be used effectively for policy formulation. “This association will have an annual meeting to articulate our views and agree on how best to boost development in the area,” Nyaigoti said.
