Kenyan boxer Rayton 'Boom Boom' Okwiri has signed a sponsorship agreement with Finix Casino. The company announced the news in a statement issued on Monday. “We are delighted that Finix Casino has agreed to sponsor Okwiri's boxing career and has gone above and beyond to ensure Okwiri has a good team to manage his affairs both inside and outside of boxing,” the statement read in part. Okwiri has appointed a team to manage his affairs both inside and outside the ring as a result of the deal. “Rayton has assembled a team that will be responsible for ensuring his success in the ring as well as a role model athlete outside of the ring.” They include Mark Wakanyaga (legal advisor), Tim Adeka (brand manager), and Cliff Mboya (operations manager). “The appointed team will collaborate closely with his trainers to ensure  the boxer is well-managed for him to achieve tangible success.” According to Finix Casino, the decision was made after considering past boxers who failed to maximize their full potential when presented with opportunities outside of the sport. Okwiri electrified the home crowd with an exhilarating performance to thump Tanzanian Ally Ndaro in their action-packed middleweight battle staged at Nairobi's KICC Tsavo ballroom a week ago. Despite Okwiri's determination to annihilate his opponent early in the combat, the two fought to the decisive round, with the Tanzanian putting up a valiant effort. A dissatisfied Okwiri, however, claimed his adversary employed shady strategies to drag the battle out. With 11 fights now under his belt, Okwiri has a record of nine wins (including six knockouts), a tie, and one defeat ( 9-1-1).
