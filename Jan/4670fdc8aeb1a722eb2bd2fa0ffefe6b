President William Ruto has censured Kericho members of the county Assembly for the recent fights witnessed last week over leadership positions. Ruto expressed his shock at the events that unfolded at the assembly saying leaders should focus on their job. He regretted that even as the country strives to leave politics aside, some leaders are still fighting for roles. "You are wasting the Assembly's time fighting for roles instead of doing the job that Kenyans gave you," Ruto said. He warned the leaders for prioritizing their needs and forgetting the voters who elected them. "Shame on you, I want all your leaders to come together and solve the woes in that assembly," he said. Ruto cited an example of the recent two-day tour of the Nyanza region. He said the opposition is for leaders and not Kenyans, who he said are equal. "No Kenyan is from the opposition, all Kenyans are our citizens, only leaders are in opposition," he said. Chaos erupted in Kericho County Assembly after MCAs disagreed over House leadership. In a video clip that went viral on social media, some MCAs were seen attacking each other as others try to separate them. The county assembly had held a special sitting to determine a new majority leader when the wrangles ensued. The house had unveiled its leadership for the third time when the row erupted. On January 9, Kamasian MCA Philip Rono was elected Majority leader while Kapsuser member Peter Kemoi was named Majority Whip. This followed the stepping down of the second house leadership, following opposition and disagreements. Before them, the Majority leader was Londiani MCA Vincent Korir with the Whip being Haron Rotich. Their leadership was challenged as the MCAs voted in Kapsoit MCA Paul Chirchir and his Kisiara counterpart Gilbert Ngetich as Majority leader and whip respectively.
