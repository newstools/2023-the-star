The National Olympic Committee of Kenya wants teams to prepare early for Paris 2024 Olympic Games. NOCK held a consultative meeting with 21 federations on Thursday at the Pride Inn, Westlands to chart the way forward with just 546 days left. The two-hour meeting also included the 2023 Games among them; the African Youth Games, Commonwealth Youth Games, Africa Beach Games and World Beach Games. “We have asked federations for their continental and international rankings. We have looked at their roadmap towards Paris 2024, their previous performance at the Games, and how we can improve on Team Kenya's performance,” said secretary general, Francis Mutuku. Eliud Kariuki, the NOCK treasurer took federations through the finance pathway of the Games with an emphasis on qualification travels of the Olympic Games. Humphrey Kayange, the Athlete Representative, spoke on the objectives of the committee, including increasing the medal tally for Team Kenya.  The legendary former Kenya Sevens star player also shed light on funding for qualifications and two additional sports that haven’t been to the Olympics. The meeting was presided over by NOC-K executive led by 1st deputy president Shadrack Maluki. President Dr. Paul Tergat was unavailable as he is in Uganda for an International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting with the Olympic Refugee Foundation team. The first step towards Paris 2024 Olympics preparations will be the announcement of the Management team including the chef de mission, chief executive officer, general team manager, and chief medical officer on Monday.
