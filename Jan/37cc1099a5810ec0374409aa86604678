Mathare United head coach, Boniface Omondi, has lauded his charges for displaying great character in their Kenyan Premier League match against  Posta Rangers at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Wednesday. The Slum Boys brushed aside a torrid start to the season and fought valiantly to earn their first point of the season in the hotly-contested rescheduled Round One match. Cavin Odongo scored for Posta Rangers in the 39th minute, but Chris Owino equalised for the Slum Boys in the 65th minute to secure the crucial point. "We're finally getting our act together, and I'm glad the boys showed a lot of improvement this afternoon," Omondi said. "If we keep the kind of spirit we showed in today's match, we'll be able to collect more points in our subsequent matches," he added. The manager, on the other hand, challenged top-flight referees to play their roles effectively so that all teams could compete on a level playing field. "In some cases, we have been defeated due to questionable officiating, and our most recent match against Ulinzi Stars was a prime example. "Only fair officiating can make the league competitive," Omondi stated. Posta Rangers' John Kamau claimed that they squandered another victory by allowing an easy goal that they could have easily defended. "We must remain focused throughout the game. Our opponents took advantage of our laziness, and we were severely punished "Kamau bemoaned. “Furthermore, we must maintain our composure in front of the goal and ensure that we capitalize on all of our scoring opportunities. We squandered clear chances in today's match, just as we did in our previous match against Gor Mahia," Kamau stated. Wednesday's match was part of the Round One KPL fixtures that were supposed to begin late last year but were postponed after five clubs filed a complaint with the Sports Disputes Tribunal challenging FKF's decision to reinstate Mathare United to top-flight action.
