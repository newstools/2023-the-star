Cabinet Secretary for Sports Ababu Namwamba says Kenya is ready to stage another world-class World Rally Championships Safari Rally in June. While addressing motorsports enthusiasts who have gathered in Monaco for the 91st Rallye Monte-Carlo, Namwamba urged the world to come and experience the Kenyan leg, which is making incredible gains on return from a 19-year absence.. He joined Monaco’s Interior Minister, Patrice Cellario, in flagging off the event, which marked the launch of the  2023 FIA WRC series. “From June 22-25, we will organise the Safari Rally which is the seventh in the WRC circuit. The organisers have deliberately run this meeting to include the Hell’s Gate wildlife range which is home to the Olkaria Geothermal project,” Namwamba said. "I invite you to come and experience the most amazing, challenging,memorable and adrenaline-pumping rally on the WRC circuit." In June, we will be celebrating 70 years of Safari and I look forward to welcoming you all to Kenya, the land of ‘Hakuna Matata’ (peace). When Namwamba took office last year, he expressed a desire to ramp up the mileage of the event across the country so that more Kenyans could share in the experience. Kenya has already applied for an exemption from the International Automobile Federation to increase the distance from 198 to 226 miles. The current FIA standard for each WRC round is 350km (217 miles). The Safari Rally was included in the 2020 World Rally Championship, marking the return of the World Rally Championships to Kenya and Africa, after a 19-year absence.
