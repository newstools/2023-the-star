The Cabinet on Thursday night surprised Health CS Susan Nakhumicha with a cake as she celebrated her birthday. During the dinner, where all CSs, Principal Secretaries and other government officials were present, Namukicha was caught by surprise when the hotel staff brought her a birthday cake. "Kata keki tukule sasa (Cut the cake, we eat)," the government officials were heard singing. CS Nakhumicha was seated next to Josphat Nanok, the State House comptroller. The Health boss proceeded to share a piece of cake with President William Ruto and his deputy Rigathi Gachagua who were seated at the next table. All top government officials are away for a five-day retreat, whose agenda is to adopt the administration's economic transformation plan based on priorities such as food security and job creation. President Ruto andÂ  Gachagua are set to address the meeting on Friday and Saturday.
