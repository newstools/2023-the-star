Pastor Dorcas Rigathi has urged women to be agents of change, as they are the centre piece that brings the world together. "Women are the changing agents. You are the transforming agent. We are the centre piece that will bring the world together," she said. Speaking in Gujarat, India, while addressing over 10,000 women, Pastor Rigathi said her mother instilled in her the discipline that she has. "She raised me and pointed to the future, and I live today despite coming from a very poor family where we did not have all the privileges. I understand what it means to not have enough food to eat, clothes to wear, but my mother (widow) put the family together," she said. Pastor Rigathi gave a passionate speech on the need to have balanced families and the role of women in society. She attended the Pramukh Swami Maharaj Shatabdi Mahotsav 100-year celebrations, which included presentations on recycling, entrepreneurship, blood donation, theatre shows and drama about drug addiction, alcoholism, unconnected families, choosing friends, and other topics. Present during the women-only meeting were Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, government officials, authors, and business leaders. She also engaged with diverse methods employed in India to fight against alcohol and drug abuse, and build strong families that included artistic works, theatre and video productions, and health interventions. She made a rallying call to the women in India to "be involved in the mentoring of the boy child" a statement she has repeated in Kenya in public forums. "If you want to change and transform the world, you must become the agent of transformation and change. Bring up the child and show them how to love. Teach them to respect and honour women as well as their parents. And when that boy child grows up, they will be able to respect women. At the formation stage, mothers shape the child through the right teachings, and this is our (women's) purpose," she added.
