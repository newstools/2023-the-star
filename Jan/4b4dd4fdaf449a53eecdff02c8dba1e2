Senator Homa Bay Moses Kajwang has said the Senate did well in saving Meru Governor Kawira Mwangaza from impeachment. Kajwang in an interview on Tuesday said problems will arise once in a while in the government because of differing opinions, and the governor should have been given more grace seeing she was a first-time governor. "The Senate in its wisdom found the charges that were brought against Mwangaza were not substantiated," he said. "The key thing is even if there were issues within that county, Â the Senate has set a high threshold for impeachment. It's not every rumour that is going to lead to impeachment," he said. He said MCAs should find better ways of conflict resolution rather than making impeachment their first option whenever misunderstandings arise in their counties. "Every government must have a little bit of imperfection. Not every single imperfection should find its way to the Senate for impeachment," he said. "There must be an approach for dispute resolution and county assemblies must be encouraged to find alternative ways of resolving issues between them and governors whenever they arise without resulting to impeachment." Kawira had on December 14 been impeached by 67 of the 69 MCAs accusing her of gross misconduct and abuse of office, all broken down to five charges. After the three-day hearing on Mwangaza's case, the Senate rejected the impeachment of Mwangaza on the basis that the charges were not substantiated on December 30, 2023. In a report tabled by the Committee chairperson Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, it said MCAs failed to provide enough evidence to back their allegations.
