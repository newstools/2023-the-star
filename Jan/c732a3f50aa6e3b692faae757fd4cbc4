Azimio leader Raila Odinga has dared the Chebukati three Commissioners to tell Kenyans why they visited his home. Speaking during the Jacaranda Rally, Raila said the former Commissioner claim that some people tried to bribe them but they have not said why they visited his home. He also disclosed that they asked him for something, and he has evidence. Raila added that he has pictures of their visit and he will make it Public if he has to. "Bwana Chebukati anasema kuna watu ambao walikuwa wanataka kumhonga. Hata wale wenzake Bwana Guliye na Bwana Molu. Nataka niwaulize mlikuja kwangu kufanya nini? Waliniomba nini? Niko na picha yao wakicheza nitatoa," the former Prime Minister said. This loosely translates to, "Chebukati is saying there are people who tried to bribe him, even his other colleagues Guliye and molu. I want to ask them what did you come to do in my house? What did they ask me for? I have pictures and if they continue playing I will make them public." RailaÂ  said they also visited former CS Raphael Tuju's home and he has video evidence. He insisted that Chebukati, the former IEBC chair belongs to jail. Raila was responding to allegation by Wafula Chebukati that officials from the National Security Advisory Council together Tuju tried to bribe them into announcing a Raila victory. According to the former Commissioners, they discouraged any continued talk of the same. The revelation was made during the Tribunal hearing. The Tribunal was formed to investigate the rebel commissioners.
