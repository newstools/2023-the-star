Chairperson of the Finance and Economic Affairs Committee at the Council of Governors Fernandes Barasa has called on the National Treasury to release county funds. Speaking at the COG offices on Thursday, Barasa said the governors have held a meeting with Treasury CS Njuguna Ndungu regarding the matter and plan to reach Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on the same. The Kakamega Governor said some counties have not received a disbursement from the month of October. "Right now, we are having arrears of almost Sh103 billion, "Barasa said. He raised concern over the delays in the disbursement of county funds which he said is crippling activities and operations in the counties. "We are calling upon the CS national treasury to expedite the release of funds so that at least counties are not having challenges delivering their activities," Barasa said. Barasa said without the release of money, governors can't fulfill their manifestos. He said staff really need to be looked at as they cannot go months without their salaries. "We can't afford to have counties waiting for three months for us to get our funds," Barasa said. He said a long-lasting solution needs to be sought for the issue. The governor said from the Budget policy statement draft 2023,"the amount to be allocated to counties is sh380 billion. " Barasa decried that though this was Sh10 billion increase, the amount still won't be enough for counties. "Many counties are in bad state, and many governors are following up on pending bills," Kisii Governor Simba Arati said. Arati said up to 16 counties have not received disbursement since October. "There are 16 counties which have not received disbursement for 4 months while the rest have not for 3 months, " Arati said.
