Education Cabinet Secretary Ezekiel Machogu on Friday flagged off textbooks for Grade 7 learners. Machogu said primary schools will next week receive 17,423,514 towards. "Every learner will receive one textbook for core subjects and optional subjects they will choose," he said. The government has spent Sh3.1 billion on the distribution of books. He added that the books will be distributed between January 30 and February 17. “The process targets all the schools that have been identified to host Junior Secondary school after the conclusion of the recent assessment by the Ministry,” he said. The event took place at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD).
