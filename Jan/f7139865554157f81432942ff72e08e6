UDM party leader Ali Roba has urged Garissa residents to remain peaceful during, before and after the January 5 by-election. The by-election comes following the resignation of Aden Duale who was appointed Defence Cabinet Secretary. The last few days have witnessed intensified campaigns from candidates as they traverse the constituency in search of votes. Roba said that politics was about a healthy competition for ideas. He spoke in Sankuri, Balambala on January 1 during the homecoming ceremony of MCA Abdirahman Borr who was elected to the UDM party. "I want to appeal to Garissa residents to maintain peace during the entire process and even after a winner is declared. At the end of the day, we remain brothers and sisters," he said. "You should not at all allow politics or this by-election to divide you." UDM has fielded Nasir Mohamed Dolal. Roba used the opportunity to champion the party saying it was the fifth-strongest party in the country in terms of elected leaders and the numbers it brought on board. "We have 11 MPs, eight in the National Assembly and three in the Senate. We also have two governors, two county assembly speakers and 64 MCAs. We want to continue growing," he said. Borr said that UDM was not only a national party but one that was championing the interests of the pastoralist community. "UDM is the party of choice for our people and one that truly pushes for our interests as a community. We feel much at home in it. As local leaders we will make sure that it grows and becomes even much bigger," he said. Former Wajir Senator Abdullahi Ali urged residents from Northern Kenya to join the party to make it strong. The by-election has attracted eight candidates.
