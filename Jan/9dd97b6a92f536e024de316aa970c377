Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua and Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja met for the first time since their 'cold war' over Nairobi started. The two were among the state officials who accompanied President William Ruto in Embakasi for the Administration Police Passing out Parade on Tuesday. Gachagua and Sakaja greeted each other with a handshake, smiling at one another, as they waited for Ruto's arrival. The two UDA leaders, have not been  seeing eye to eye over their different opinions on decongesting Nairobi’s Central Business District. In December 2022, Sakaja announced that long-distance matatus will be relocated from the CBD to Green Park terminus. However, according to the DP, Sakaja ought to have consulted him before making decisions, which affect the businesses of the people of Mt Kenya - who gave him votes. Governor Sakaja who has insisted that there is no cold ware between him and the DP said some matters should be addressed away from the public. "I respect Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua as holding a senior position in our party...let me not speak too much about this issue...but there are areas we are not agreeing," he said. "There are things that we are supposed to do away from public glare and I am concerned that these politics of today are introducing me to tribal dimensions, while all along I have never even imagined profiling tribes," Sakaja added. On Sunday, Gachagua during an interview at Inooro TV said he has no problem with Sakaja but he is only looking out for the wellness of Kenyans. He added that he is the bridge between county and the national government, so he has the mandate to speak up when things are not going well. "I cannot just sit when things are going wrong, our government is keen on supporting businesses and not fighting them. I have no problem with  Sakaja,"Gachagua said.
