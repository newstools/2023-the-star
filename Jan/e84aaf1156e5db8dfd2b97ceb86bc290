Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua will preside over the ninth edition of the annual Kenya Inter-Counties Sports and Cultural Association games in Kisumu on Monday. More than 8,000 guest and participants are expected to grace the occasion. Governor Anyang Nyong’o disclosed this on Thursday during a briefing on the county’s preparedness to host the inter counties games. “I want to thank the Deputy President for accepting to be our host of the games and to open it when the games start,” he said. Nyong’o said Gachagua will arrive in the lakeside city in due course, ahead of the game set for Monday 16. “Even though President William Ruto will be around tomorrow (Friday), I want to assure you the DP will be in Kisumu to officiate the games. He is our chief guest,” he said. This is the second time the county will be hosting the Deputy President. Last September, Nyong’o hosted the DP who presided over the 94th edition of the Kenya Music Festival in Kisumu. KICOSCA games was founded in 2013 at the onset of devolution. It morphed from the old association, previously known as the Kenya Inter-Municipalities Sports and Cultural Association- KIMSCA. The games aim to give an opportunity to employees from the 47 county governments, to exhibit their sporting talents and to interact and learn from each other’s cultural orientations. It also enables the staff to benchmark and have a health break to help drive productivity. Since its inception, Kicosca games have been hosted by Nairobi, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Kiambu, Machakos, Kisii, Kericho and Embu counties.
