LGBTQ activist Edwin Chiloba's adoptive and spiritual parents Peter and Donna Pfaltzgraff have penned touching tributes to him, asking for prayers. "Edwin, we love you," Peter said on Facebook. They wrote this on learning he had been brutally murdered in Eldoret. The motive is yet to be known. “Our hearts are broken tonight. Will give more details when we can share more. Please pray for us.” The couple was close to Chiloba and referred to him as their spiritual son. The elderly couple originating from the US and running the Grace and Faith Family Ministry expressed their disbelief, asking for prayers during this period. Edwin's adoptive parents supported his passion for fashion by purchasing equipment for him to start his career as a designer in 2021. "Glory be to God, to my dear parents getting parents like you by my side makes me what I am today. Thank you so much for supporting me unconditionally. Thank you for helping me to shape my life with positivity and passion. Without you, I’d never have been the person I am today. Thank you for everything, thank you for always praying for me and building me with the word of God. One day I will make you proud," he said in a post dated January 2021. Chiloba's body was discovered in a metallic box on Kipenyo-Katinga Road in Uasin Gishu County by boda boda riders, who saw an unmarked vehicle dumping the box on the side of the road. A suspect was arrested on Friday over the murder. Police are looking for two more suspects. The suspect was known to the deceased as a partner and had travelled to Eldoret to join the deceased for New Year celebrations. Police suspect money or love gone bad as the motive in the murder.
