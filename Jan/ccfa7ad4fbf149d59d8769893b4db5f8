Harmonize has asked Rwandese people to forgive his former boss Diamond Platnumz. The WCB CEO was supposed to perform at the 'One People' concert on December 23 at the Bk Arena but he didn't show up. Speaking on Rwanda TV, Harmonize asked the people of Rwanda to forgive his ex-mentor. "I don't know what the problem was but I just want to take this opportunity on behalf of all Tanzanians to ask you to forgive him because you don't know what happens in life sometimes," he said. "I call upon all Rwandese to forgive him. I know next time he will make it. Let's take our music to the world." Harmonize and Diamond have not been seeing eye to eye since Harmonize exited Diamond's music label WCB.
