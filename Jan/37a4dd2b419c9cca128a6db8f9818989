A man charged with child sexual abuse has pleaded not guilty. Appearing before Chief Magistrate Honorable Elizabeth Osui at the Malindi law courts, Patrick Mbauni alias Pat ARV denied the charges of against him. The 28-year -old was arraigned by DCI Child Protection Unit, on suspicions of being a paedophile. The Directorate of Criminal Investigation said Mbauni had been abusing young boys sexually. The suspect was arrested in Malindi last Wednesday, January 11, for harbouring four boys aged between 10 and 12 in his house. This was after detectives based at the DCI Academy intercepted disturbing content online, portraying him abusing the minors. The sleuths using specialized software for flagging such content online went for the suspect who runs a football foundation in Malindi, which he has been using to lure innocent minors before engaging them in the beastly act. "Medical tests later confirmed that two of the minors had been sexually abused," DCI said. On Tuesday, Mbauni pleaded not guilty to two counts of defilement, four counts of child pornography and four counts of child trafficking. He will remain in custody until February 7, for a pre-bail hearing.
