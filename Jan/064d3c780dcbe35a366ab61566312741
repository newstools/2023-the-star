Kakamega county governor, Fernandez Barasa, has rewarded his football team with Sh100,000 for winning the title at the just concluded 2023 Kenya Inter County Sports and Cultural Association Games. Kakamega emerged champions after thrashing Busia County 3-1 in action-packed finals hosted at Jomo Kenyatta Stadium in Kisumu County over the weekend. In a statement, Barasa congratulated his players, trainers, and managers, for a job well done, saying the small token was meant to lift their spirits in the subsequent events. “On matters of social development, one of my manifesto pillars is nurturing talents and supporting the youth sporting activities and the team's participation in Kicosca is in line with that,” Barasa said The county boss hinted that president William Ruto is planning to organise a national sports program from the grassroots and it's most likely to be launched in the course of the year in Kakamega. “This will be soccer and other sports events from the ward level and will seek to nurture raw talent that is in plenty in this county,” he stated. Barasa said he is in discussion with Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba to support some of the infrastructural projects in the county, especially Bukhungu Stadium. The national government is expected to fund Phase Three of the Bukhungu Stadium to make it a fully-fledged international stadium. "We have also agreed with the national government to support the renovation of 14 stadia around the county,” Barasa added. The county chief further said three soccer academies in three regions within Kakamega county will be established courtesy of the national government.
