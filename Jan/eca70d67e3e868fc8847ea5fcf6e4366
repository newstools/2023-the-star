It's all systems go for president William Ruto Narok's thanksgiving celebrations at William ole Ntimama stadium in Narok Town on Sunday. Narok Governor Patrick ole Ntutu, county commissioner Isaac Masinde led the county security team and officials from both county and National governments to inspect the scene and gave a node to the setup. "We are ready to host the president and his delegation in Narok for prayers, which will start at 9 am and end at 12:30 noon," said Ntutu during a briefing at Zebu hotel in Narok town. Ntutu said the event is purely a prayer service and there will be no politics. "For other matters, the president will be coming at a later date, where we can launch development projects and politics," said Ntutu. Masinde on his part said security in the Town has been heightened before, during and after the president's tour and proper plans have been put in place for the flow of traffic and people in the town. He said the president will be expected to land at Maasai Girls playground at 8:30 before he proceeds to the Stadium. All churches including protestant, evangelical churches and Catholic churches have been asked to direct their congregants to the stadium for prayers. Narok Chamber of Commerce and Industry David Mpatiany asked people to turn up in large numbers and accord the President a warm reception. "This is the best opportunity for our leaders to tell the Head of State the problem we are facing. "Issues of roads, water and the economy are the problems really biting people which leaders need to tell the president," said Mpatiany. The chairman called on the business community to use the opportunity by being strategic in their businesses so as to accommodate all the visitors who will tour the town from all over the country.
