Ryan Burl's late knock of 30 helped hosts Zimbabwe clinch a 2-1 win over Ireland in the T20 series in Harare. Harry Tector's 47 contributed to Ireland posting 141-9 with Curtis Campher hitting 27 before becoming one of all-rounder Burl's two victims. Despite skipper Craig Ervine's 54, Ireland kept Zimbabwe's batting in check until Burl's 18th over heroics. Burl fired two sixes and a four off successive George Dockrell deliveries to help the hosts win by four wickets. Luke Jongwe, who also took two wickets in the Ireland innings, hit the winning four in the final ball of the 19th over but it was Burl's knock which proved key as he finished unbeaten on 30. The sides will begin a three-match one-day series in Harare on Wednesday.
