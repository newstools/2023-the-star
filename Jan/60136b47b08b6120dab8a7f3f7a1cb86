Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has urged President William Ruto to ignore the sideshows by Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance. Mudavadi said the president should stay focused and not be destructed by the happenings being propagated by the Azimio camp led by Raila Odinga. Speaking at the William Ole Ntimama Stadium in Narok county during an Interdenominational prayer service, he said the Azimio theatrics are out to cause unnecessary anxiety and signalling a recipe of economic instability that could result into threatening national peace and unity. “Mr President, keep your eye on the ball. As your foot soldiers we will support you fully in the quest to move Kenya to the next level of economic prosperity,” Mudavadi said. “Any program or agenda that somebody is pursuing now to disrupt the economy in the middle of a drought is an ill-advised agenda." He said it was now evident that many Azimio supporters have not accepted the reality of things after the August 2022 Kenya Kwanza victory. Mudavadi added that time for engaging in political mind games is long gone where a few people want to instil political fear among citizens with an aim of disrupting normalcy. The Prime CS appealed to the media to stop creating scenarios in the minds of Kenyans through calculated, shrewd and unprecedented narratives regarding the outcome of the 2022 general election. He said such moves may once again fuel negative energy among Kenyans. “We had a peaceful election, and I want to appeal to the members of the 4th estate please let us get out of the election mode," Mudavadi said. He noted that the Kenya Kwanza government is putting in place steady plans and policies to return the country into a stable economic state.
