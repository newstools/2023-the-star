Azimio la Umoja One Kenya affiliate parties are now accused of plotting to cripple its operations. Led by Jubilee party secretary general Jeremiah Kioni and his ODM counterpartÂ  Edwin Sifuna, the leaders on Friday said they are yet to receive the political parties' funds. Kioni said that all 48 qualifying parties have not received the funds. "Political parties have not received the first, second and third quarter funding even after the political parties dispute tribunal directed on December 6 2022 the Registrar of Political Parties to release the first quarter funding covering the period July to September 2022," Kioni said. "The funds were to be released to all qualifying parties pending the full determination of UDA application for a review of allocation formula." Sifuna accused the government of trying to cripple the opposition political parties by withholding the funds. Nairobi Senator said that President William Ruto had earlier said the funds were released. "We as secretaries-general of the qualifying parties have had a meeting with the Registrar of Political Parties and she confirmed that in fact, treasury has still not disbursed the money," Sifuna said. "When the President says that he expects a very robust opposition, he is lying to Kenyans because his actions are directed towards ensuring that they cripple political parties, especially the opposition political parties." They spoke at a joint press conference on Friday. The entire kitty for the political parties in the 2022/23 financial year will benefit at least 48 political parties.
