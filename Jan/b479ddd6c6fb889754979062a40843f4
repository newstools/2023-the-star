Makadara MP George Aladwa has declared his interest to contest the Vihiga Governor in the 2027 general elections. Aladwa said he had initially planned to contest the seat in 2022 under ODM party but changed his mind along the way. “I had plans to contest for that governor seat but I felt it was not the right time, so I had to go back and defend my Makadara MP seat,” he said. The lawmaker said he has all the experience to work as a county boss as managing five constituencies and 25 wards won’t give him a headache. Aladwa says if he managed to run Nairobi county with 17 constituencies and 85 wards he is best placed to develop Vihiga. “I want to give my people credible services as I have done for the city people when I served as a councillor, deputy mayor, acting mayor and mayor,” Aladwa said. “Am not undermining those who are in leadership at the moment they have done their best within their capacity and resources available." The lawmaker has currently served as a city politician for 30 years. Aladwa has been meeting women groups, youths and clerics in Vihiga county and has also been participating in community functions and funerals as well. “Mapema ndio best’ I decided to come as early as this to make a statement ahead of the 2027 governor race so that people should know me, see me and for me to understand them well,” he said.
