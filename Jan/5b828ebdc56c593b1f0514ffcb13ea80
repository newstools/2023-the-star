Tusker head coach Robert Matano has lashed out at his players for the dismal performance that saw them crash 3-0 to Kenya Police at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Saturday. The Ruaraka-based brewers surrendered their command of the Kenyan Premier League table, following the humiliating defeat. Elvis Rupia's hat trick in the first half was all Police needed to secure their fifth victory of the season. "We underperformed in the first half and awoke too late in the second half when the damage was already done," Matano said. "We got off to a slow start and let our opponents take control of the game. "Despite the huge setback, Matano expects his charges to recover and win their next games. "Winning the championship is never an easy road. We have to keep our heads up and keep working," he added. Police head coach, Francis Baraza extolled his charges for fighting gallantly to outplay their opponents. “It was a commendable performance this afternoon. Hopefully, we will keep the momentum going for the rest of the season to boost our chances to remain in title contention," Baraza said. As Tusker faltered in their crunch tie,  Nzoia Sugar reclaimed the top spot after rallying from behind to upset Ulinzi Stars 2-1 at Ulinzi Complex in Nairobi. Kakamega Homeboyz handed Mathare United their heaviest defeat of the season after thrashing them 5-1 at Ruaraka grounds in Nairobi. KCB and Wazito settled for a one-all draw at Muhoroni Stadium in Kisumu while Talanta registered the same scoreline against Posta Rangers at Thika Stadium.
