800 ECD teachers have been employed on permanent and pensionable terms by the County government of Vihiga. The 800 were initially serving on contract in the county for the last two years under Governor Wilber Ottichilo’s administration. Initially, the ECD teachers have been depending on tokens from parents to sustain themselves. “These teachers have gone through a lot and when I came in as the governor, I promised to change their lives, from depending on handouts to stipends,” Ottichilo said. “So we gave out two-year contracts and the interviews were conducted by the County Public Service Board (CPSB) and 800 got right,” he added. The governor said that putting those teachers on the contract was a way of weighing if the county could have managed to pay them if they are employed on a permanent basis. He urged the teachers to focus on helping learners achieve their dreams in life citing that they (ECD teachers) are key to the county's education centre. “What we are going to give out might not be enough but it's better off than nothing, it will help you grow in different ways,” The county boss told the teachers. The county boss was addressing the ECD teachers at Kidundu Stadium on Friday before issuing the permanent and pensionable letters. While receiving the letters majority of the teachers said it has not been a walk in the park surviving on empty hands. “Governor let God reward you. We have been tormented, we have been abused, some of us spend nights with no food but we are working,” one of them said. Ottichilo hired 800 ECD teachers across the county starting from Hamisi, Sabatia, Vihiga, Luanda and Emuhaya. However, the governor was urged to reconsider those who were not picked on the contract terms so that they can also enjoy the benefits their colleagues are going to enjoy.
