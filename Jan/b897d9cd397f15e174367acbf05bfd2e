In the new Executive order of 2023 issued on Monday, Ruto said Hussein will now have his own office at State House. This means that the Office of State House Spokesperson is delinked from the office of the Presidential Communication Service. Hussein's office which will be under Ruto will mainly communicate matters of the State House. His main mandate will be to release statements on functions and projects at the State House as assigned. Other functions include coordinating digital messaging, branding research and press at State House. Hussein took over from Kanze Dena who was the official spokes-lady for former president Uhuru Kenyatta. While accepting the appointment, Hussein pledged to tirelessly work in supporting Ruto to deliver Kenya Kwanza's agenda. "Mr President, I’m grateful and humbled by the honour you have bestowed upon me to serve as State House Spokesperson, I pledge to tirelessly work. Thanks patriots for your congratulatory messages," he said.
