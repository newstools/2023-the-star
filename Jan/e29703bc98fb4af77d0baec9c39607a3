Manchester United staged a stunning late turnaround to come from behind and beat Manchester City in a dramatic derby at Old Trafford. City looked to be closing the gap on Premier League leaders Arsenal after substitute Jack Grealish headed them in front from Kevin de Bruyne's cross on the hour, only for United to send their fans into raptures with a superb recovery. Erik ten Hag's side drew level in contentious fashion with 12 minutes left as Bruno Fernandes scored despite the presence of Marcus Rashford in an offside position, City's protests that he had interfered with play ignored despite the flag going up. Rashford was the central figure again four minutes later when he swept in substitute Alejandro Garnacho's cross at the Stretford End to move United to within one point of City, who remain five points adrift of Arsenal.
