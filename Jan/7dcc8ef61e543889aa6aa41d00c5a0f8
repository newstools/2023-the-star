The Directorate of Criminal Investigation women's volleyball team will use Kasarani Indoor facilities in preparations for the playoffs that will be held at the same venue next weekend, coach Daniel Bor has confirmed. The sleuths resume training on Monday following the pass-out of 14 players as police constables from Kiganjo Police Training College early this week. The team is trying to get their act together ahead of the three-day championship slated for January 20-22. DCI face a herculean task against African Club champions KCB, defending league champions Kenya Prisons who have won the past four editions of the competition in a row, and an in-form Kenya Pipeline team coached by Paul Gitau that last bagged the prestigious accolade in 2017. Bor added that DCI are eager to upset the form book, adding that they have what it takes to claim a historic title glory. "They have had enough rest for sure. We will be back at work on Monday. Players need to make good use of the Kasarani gymnasium and I believe they will be match ready for the playoffs." "We are going to bring the toughest challenge in this year's championship. It's not going to be business as usual. DCI won't just be escorts. I believe my charges will go for the gong." Despite the team not training together for a while, the gaffer said his players are in good physical condition. He promised to push his charges harder in training for them to be at their peak in order to exploit their potential. "Qualifying for the playoffs means the team is improving. They now must get out of their comfort zone." "Lack of synergy could be a factor during the games but we pray that coordination among different departments will work in our favour." DCI finished third in the regular season behind Pipeline, who topped the seven-team log unbeaten and KCB, who settled for second position. Prisons claimed the last playoff slot and this is the first time in four yearsÂ  Prisons have finished outside the top three.
