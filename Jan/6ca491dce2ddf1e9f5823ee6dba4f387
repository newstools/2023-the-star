Ugandan singer Jose Chameleone has said he is not perfect after a video of him whipping a boda boda rider surfaced online last week. Speaking to Ugandan media on Monday, the 'Valu Valu' hitmaker said the boda boda industry also has bad people. "I am not an angel, and the boda man is also not an angel," he said. Chameleone's ex-wife Danielle demanded justice for the boda boda rider, adding that no one is immune from prosecution. "Zero tolerance for violence," Atim shared on Instagram, captioning an artwork that read: "Violence will not be tolerated." His public relations team also released a statement regarding the incident, saying he beat up the rider in self-defence. He alleged that the rider damaged the left side of his Range Rover. He apologised to his fans, promising to handle such scenarios in a better way. "The incident is regrettable and could have been avoided. Similar incidents will be handled better going forward," Chameleone said through his PR team.
