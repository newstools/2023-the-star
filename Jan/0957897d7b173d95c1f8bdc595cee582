There will be no extrajudicial killings in my government, President William Ruto has assured. The president said that is a chapter they have closed since he took over power. He said they have agreed with police bosses that they will operate within the law. "I have sat down with the commander of police from the IG downwards and we have agreed that they will operate within the law." The President however noted that operating within the law includes defending themselves. "They are licensed to use firearms to deal with criminals and defend themselves too. If they don't defend themselves they won't be there to sort out the criminals." The President was responding to questions from journalists during a roundtable interview, where he was asked to comment on sentiments by his officers that police must defend themselves by use of a firearm. "I don't think what the Deputy President or IG said was meant to mean that they want to continue with extrajudicial killings. That is not our policy and we have aligned as a government." President Ruto added that as an administration they are going to respect and work with all institutions that make sure that government works by respecting the rule of law. "So Ipoa has our support, we are going to fund and support them. In fact, already I have told them that they must begin to give us a program on the investigation of how we ended up with close to 200 people being killed and dumped." He added: "So when you find this institution saying something contrary to another institution that is the beauty of democracy it does not mean we are at war but it's how the system is meant to work. Every institution is supposed to check the other to make sure that everybody has a Constitutional mandate and operates within them."
