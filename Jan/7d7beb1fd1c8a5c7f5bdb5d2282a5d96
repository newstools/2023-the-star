A Kisii landlord has narrated tearfully how a County Ward Rep who had been his tenant for years allegedly fled at night leaving huge rental arrears. Philip Matoke told journalists that the Kisii Central Ward Rep - Duke Nyarango- allegedly slithered out in the wee hours of Monday night after he got a whiff of a planned visit by auctioneers Tuesday. He allegedly packed his belongings and walked out in the dead of the night. He had incurred Sh32,000 in rent arrears according to the landlord. The landlord said he pestered the two-time MCA over the cumulative rent in vain forcing him to seek the court for help. On Tuesday morning, the landlord said he, police officers and the auctioneer got the shock of their life when they found the house empty and deserted "What we found was a yawning house, nothing was there, he just fled," Matoke told journalists outside the house. The MCA and the landlord had agreed that he pays Sh10,000 per month in rent only for him to allegedly pay Sh9,000 monthly. It was the reminder that kept the arrears climbing to Sh32,000. "He had never shown signs of commitment to pay and that is why I resorted to court," said Matoke. At times, the Ward Rep allegedly skipped paying rent for over five months. During the campaign, he is accused of saying he was running low on cash to pay due to the campaigns. And after he was elected, he allegedly never bothered to pay. At some point, the landlord said he blocked his calls forcing him to use his friends' phones. Matoke moved to court last month and obtained a court order to evict him. The MCA declined to comment after the Star contacted him for a comment. We pledge to give his side of the story once he talks to the Star.
