The stage is set for the 9th edition of the Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association (Kicosca) which gets underway today (Monday) in Kisumu City. More than 32 counties will battle it out for top honours in 21 disciplines. About 8, 000 participants are expected at the week-long event. The opening ceremony will be held at Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Mamboleo.  Several governors including the host Anyang’ Nyong’o are expected to grace the event. According to Nyong’o, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua will preside over the opening ceremony. After the opening ceremony, Kisumu will start their campaign for the football title against Nyandarua. There will also be three tug-of-war duels pitting Kakamega against Kiambu in the women’s category. Nairobi will test their mettle against Nakuru while Kisumu and Bungoma will contest for a foothold in the men’s category. Buoyant Nairobi will be seeking to retain their title which they won in Embu last year but they will face stiff competition from perennial rivals Uasin Gishu and hosts Kisumu. Nairobi beat Kisumu to second place with Uasin Gishu finishing third and Laikipia fourth. Winning teams will represent Kenya at the East Africa Local Authorities (Ealasca) to be held in Kigali, Rwanda.
