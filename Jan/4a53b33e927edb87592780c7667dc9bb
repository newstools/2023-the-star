Mombasa Deputy Governor Francis Thoya has challenged residents to get involved in waste management. Thoya, who led the Rapid Response Initiative to clean Mombasa within their 100 days in office, said the youth in the region should be at the forefront and be involved in cleaning the region. He spoke during the launch of the finalist phase of the Mombasa Plastics Prize at the SwahiliPot Hub amphitheatre in Mombasa on Thursday. Mombasa has employed about 2,000 youth, under the Mombasa Ni Yangu Programme, to ensure the county remains clean. “The responsibility of waste management is entirely the responsibility of the local community and not of the county government. Therefore, we want the youth to be at the forefront to ensure that they stay in a clean neighbourhood,” Thoya said. According to Thoya, the 100 Rapid Results Initiative to clean Mombasa has yielded some positive results and the coastal city looks remarkably clean compared to before they took over county leadership. However, he said a few individuals are still dumping garbage along the busy roads. "The cleaning exercise in Mombasa has come at a heavy cost, yet some members of the community have declined to change their mindset," Thoya said. “Every morning, you will find sacks of garbage placed along Bondeni area. How do you allow someone to dump waste openly and in public? This should stop.” The Mombasa Plastics Prize, which is backed by USAID and the government of Canada, is run by Challenge Works. It aims to inspire young innovators to tackle marine plastic waste within the county. Aurelia Micko, the director of USAID Kenya and East Africa Environment office, said they are proud to be part and parcel of the programme. “We are partners and together with many sponsors, this is our first programme to engage in. We have prioritised informal settlements and engaged the youth in this project,” she said.
