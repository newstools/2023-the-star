Juma Jux has been spotted with a woman who closely resembles his ex-girlfriend Vanessa Mdee. In a video on social media, one can see Jux toasting with a lady who turns out to be Karen Bujulu, whom he dated last year, and was his video vixen. In case you don't know, the singer also showed off the romantic moment on his Instagram. Karen on her part captioned a plane picture, "This time around I’m catching both feelings and flights." The couple is headed to Paris, a favorite vacation destination of Juma Jux. Even their fans were excited that the two are back together. Read some of those comments below; tontofloxy...Msalimie jumaaa dorice_8four..Mama Jux go in paris salazahke...Si ndio juma jux huyu hapa lynee_mtandi...Kumbe upo na juma napenda couple yenu 😍😍 In subsequent videos, Juma Jux shows he has arrived in France, as he shows off a friend and the location they were at. They also had dinner and we could see there were other friends, but he did not turn the camera in that direction. He only showed the male friend having his sumptuous dinner. Juma and Karen went viral in 2022 when he soft-launched her as his Valentine's date which turned out to be a song. They also went on vacation together. She is a Tanzanian Rwandese woman who loves traveling and does fitness content. Jux then at some point suddenly stopped sharing her content on his platforms, sending signals that it was over. Soon after, Huddah Monroe came onto the scene.
