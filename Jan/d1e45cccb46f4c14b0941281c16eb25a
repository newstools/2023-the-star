Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Saturday visited the family of late former Education CS George Magoha at their home in Lavington Estate, Nairobi. He was accompanied by some members of the cabinetÂ and top Government officials in condoling with the family. "I conveyed heartfelt condolences from President William Samoei Ruto." "He described the late Prof Magoha as a distinguished public servant who demonstrated utmost dedication, patriotism, and commitment to work. His service will be greatly missed," he said. The DP said the government will assist the family in every way possible to ensure a befitting send-off for the former Education Cabinet Secretary. Several leaders have continued to troop to the home to condole with the family over the loss even as tributes continue to pour. Magoha, 71, passed on Tuesday evening at the Nairobi Hospital.
