The Football Kenya Federation National Super League (NSL) resumes on Friday after the festive season break. Two games are scheduled for Friday in round six of the fixtures. At Wundanyi Stadium in Taita, Mwatate United FC will host top-of-the-table Kibera Black Stars FC. Kibera Black Stars will hope to extend their lead on top of the table. They lead the log with 10 points, same as Shabana, who have an inferior goal difference. In another encounter scheduled for Friday, SS Assad FC will welcome Darajani Gogo FC at Shamu Grounds in Ukunda, Kwale County. On Saturday, Shabana will hope to maintain their unbeaten run when they play Mara Sugar FC at Awendo Green Stadium in Migori. In their last fixture last year, Shabana were held to a goalless draw by a stubborn Vihiga United side. Shabana coach Sammy Okoth challenged his charges to convert the chances they create, observing that his strikers have been misfiring in the four games played so far. “I hope my strikers will start converting the many chances we are creating,” said Okoth.
