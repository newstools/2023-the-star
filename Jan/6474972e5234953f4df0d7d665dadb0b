The building bridges initiative (BBI) was a ploy aimed at deceiving Kenyans, President William Ruto has claimed. Ruto who was speaking during a TV interview said there were no constitutional recommendations proposed by former president Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga who were the proponents. "BBI ilikuwa ba ukora mtupu, wale majamaa waliweka ukora mwingi halafu sukari juu ya ati sijui mambo ya kina mama hapo," he said. Ruto said his decision to have the Constitution amended was informed by the need to accomplish what his predecessor had initiated. He noted, "Among the things I found on the table was the recommendation to have parliament dissolved due to failure to realize the two-third gender rule". He said having assumed office it was incumbent upon him to find ways how to ensure this succeeds so that he can fulfil the pledges he made to the women hence his decision to write to both Houses. The head of state at the same said he is not planning to reward the ODM leader through his proposal to create the office of an official opposition leader. "Mimi simtafutii mtu kazi? Nikisema the office of the opposition leader is an institution, not a person, mimi natafuta accountability," he remarked. He said if he was a selfish man he would have a problem with individuals opposing his administration arguing in a democracy, the opposition ought to have a place in government.
