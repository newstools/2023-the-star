Traders in Gikomba are running their daily business despite the market being crowded. Gikomba Market, East Africa’s largest open-air market, has experienced unpredictable fires annually. A section of the market went up in flames on December 28, 2022, leaving traders counting losses. Construction is ongoing in some parts of the market that caught fire. In October, Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja pledged to set up a fire station at the market to deal with recurrent fires. He also said he will have the land surveyed and title deeds issued saying land grabbers and speculators are some of those behind the fires. For decades, Gikomba market has been a source of income for many including food vendors, second-hand clothes traders, carpenters, business people, and many more.
