President William Ruto now wants Kenya Power to stop disconnecting Kenyans from the grid over illegal connections. Speaking on Friday, the head of state said it is their responsibility to see to it that all Kenyans have electricity, and at no point should a whole estate be disconnected because of a few individuals. He directed that if anyone is found using electricity, regardless of how they got connected, Kenya Power should have a meter connected and start charging them for the electricity used. "My good friends at the Kenya power and lighting company, it is your responsibility to connect Kenyans to electricity. If you find a citizen has been connected to electricity by whatever means go and put a meter and begin to charge them. Don't switch off a whole estate," he said. Ruto spoke in Shauri Moyo during the launch of affordable housing projects. He was responding to an issue that has seen several city estates go for weeks without electricity. The president called on Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja to have a sit down with Kenya Power to have the matter resolved. "I want to repeat here, Kenya power should sit with Nairobi County Government so that we know which area has been disconnected and why." He added, "These areas should be reconnected and Kenyans told how they can pay for the electricity. How do you penalise someone for using electricity yet you have not asked them to pay and they refused?" Ruto said they should ensure every homestead that uses electricity has a meter.
