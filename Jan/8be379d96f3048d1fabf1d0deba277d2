Keroche heiress Anerlisa Muigai and her ex-husband Ben Pol have been making headlines for a couple of weeks. This is after an explosive interview withÂ Millard AyoÂ in which Ben Pol said he did not enjoy his marriage with the Keroche heiress. Anerlisa did not take it lightly and was forced to give a stern warning to Ben Pol asking him to move on as there was no hope they would ever reconcile and be back together. Anerlisa also asked Ben Pol to stop using her name to stay relevant and even leaked simp messages he had sent back in December. Ben Pol has since apologized saying he did not intend to hurt his ex-lover adding thatÂ his intention was to share his experience on the marriage. "I want to apologize for the things I said about my marriage during my series of interviews with Millard Ayo, which started broadcasting on the 13th of January, 2023. My intention was never to hurt but to share my experience of the marriage, an experience I take full responsibility for,"Â he said. Ben added that he wanted to articulate how it affected his mental health. He said he will be mindful in speaking about the topic and his experience. Fans have had a mixed reaction towards the apology with many saying there was no need for him to apologize.Â Here is what some have said; mcbel_jr:Â As men we are becoming weak. hiram_._: Where the whips Kinuthia. mtunecessary:Â Ben Simpson Paulo itabidi umetafuta Sila alipo mlango wa mapenzi ufunguke. thetrendymood_254:Â This institution called marriage is the only place where enemies stay together.. _law_____:Â ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚Andwer kibe mtu ana apologies kwa bibi yake ni nani. icekeedonthetrack:Â Huyu Ben Pol anafaa zile whips za Kibe. feih_faith:Â Watu waheal tu na wamove onðŸ˜±.
