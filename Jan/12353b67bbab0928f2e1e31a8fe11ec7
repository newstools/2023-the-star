Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission on Wednesday hosted the Head of Public Service Felix Koskei at the Integrity Center. Koskei, who met with EACC chairperson Eliud Wabukala, CEO Twalib Mbarak, commissioners and the executive management, was accompanied by a delegation from his office. He lauded EACC for the progress made in fighting graft, urging it to always remain professional and impartial as an independent body. The Head of PSC and his delegation were taken through EACC's mandate, the milestones realized, challenges experienced and opportunities for collaboration. Sources within the anti-graft body further said Koskei assured the Commission that the government is committed to supporting EACC's mandate. This is aimed at advancing good governance in the country. Koskei pledged to explore mechanisms, including administrative ones, for the effective enforcement of EACC recommendations arising from system reviews. The reviews are undertaken by the integrity body with the aim to deter and prevent corruption in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). EACC is legally mandated with examining the systems, policies and practices of public bodies to detect any loopholes conducive to corruption, so as to inform appropriate interventions. This includes securing revision of methods of work. "Pursuant to this mandate, the Commission undertakes these reviews either on its own motion or invitation of the MDAs and counties," the source said. Upon the reviews, EACC makes recommendations to be implemented by the reviewed agencies. The Commission does not, however, have an enforcement mechanism to ensure the implementation of the reform recommendations. "Implementation of the EACC system review recommendations would greatly reduce corruption in the public service," the source added. In the last three years, EACC has undertaken reviews in 26 MDAs and 24 county governments. It identified corruption loopholes mainly in financial management, procurement and recruitment.
