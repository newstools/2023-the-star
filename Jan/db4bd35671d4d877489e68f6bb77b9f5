Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has revealed he used his own money to erect 'Welcome Back' billboards around the city. Sakaja was responding to a Twitter user who questioned the source of funds used in erecting the billboards which elicited mixed reactions on social media. Sakaja responded by saying the money came from his pocket, adding that most Nairobians appreciated the move. "Yes, I used my own money. You may not like it, but many appreciate it," Sakaja tweeted. The billboards have been spotted along Waiyaki Way, Thika Super Highway and Mombasa Road. Sakaja and his deputy Njoroge Muchiri wished Nairobians who are coming back to Nairobi following the long Christmas holiday, a prosperous new year. "Welcome back, Prosperous 2023! Let's make Nairobi work," the billboard reads. The move has received love and hate in equal measures as Kenyans on Twitter lamented about the poor state of the city. They said the money used to put up the billboards should have been used elsewhere.
