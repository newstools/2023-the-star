Meru Governor Kawira Mwangaza made her first public appearance in Meru town since the Senate saved her from impeachment. Mwangaza said she felt handcuffed and could not effectively work for the people. "My children it's like I was in the desert or in remand but now I am back to you. I will work for you, I will make Meru happy," Mwangaza said. Mwangaza was accompanied by Roads chief officer George Kimathi where she promised to repair the drainage system in Meru town. The governor warned all cartels to pack their bags and leave before she starts working effectively for the people. She also placed shoddy contractors on notice saying their days are numbered. "I will not accept shoddy work or development,"Mwangaza said. She said her Okolea programme will go on and she will be conducting it every Sunday with the First Gentleman Murega Baichu. "I will do all my work as governor on weekdays and on Sundays. I will be doing the Okolea programme," Mwangaza said. Mwangaza was warned to delink the Okolea programme with her duties as county boss. Mwangaza met Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua last week. The DP is mediating to end the tussle between the county chief and the MCAs.
