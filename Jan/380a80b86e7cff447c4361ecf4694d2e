Narok Senator Ledama Olekina has heaped praise on the ODM leader Raila Odinga labelling him as his inspiration. In a tweet on Thursday, Ledama shared kind words for the opposition chief saying: "Your agility and dedication to service is my inspiration @RailaOdinga … the dream will come true someday! We are the dream! It’s coming my Mentor." Ledama, who has hinted at vying for the presidency in 2027, has supported the ODM leader for the presidency in at least two presidential elections. The second-term senator has been a member of the ODM party for over a decade. He was first elected to serve the people of Narok county as a senator in 2017. Raila has been contesting for the presidency since 1997, save for 2002. His recent loss is on August 9, 2022, against President William Ruto. The Chief Opposition leader however blamed the recent election's loss on an unfair process. "Kenyans elected their leaders, from MCAs all the way to the president. The process was fairly smooth, people turned up and voted. The only issue that went wrong was the management of the presidential election," he said during an interview with Citizen TV. On December 27, 2022, Raila said he was committed to clearing up the issue, which he believes was the fault of the IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati. "We want an audit of these results so that Kenyans can have confidence in the IEBC ahead of the 2027 and subsequent elections," he said. He however did not reveal his plan in 2027, saying if he does not run, someone else will. "I don’t have to run for president in 2027. If I don’t run, somebody else would. But I haven't said I won't run."
