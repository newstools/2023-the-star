Wema Sepetu's bae Whozu will convert to Islam before their wedding later this year. Speaking in a radio interview, Whozu said nothing will stop him from marrying Wema. "I will convert and get married to her this year," he said. Wema and Whozu have been friends for long before they announced their marriage in 2022. Sepetu told the doubters she is very much in love. "Let the haters hate. Love is beautiful. You don't know the meaning of love because you've not been loved." She added that she is now happy thanks to her new lover. "All that matters is my happiness. My happiness comes first and the rest follows." The couple suffered a miscarriage three months into the pregnancy last year.
