Slain LGBTQ activist Edwin Kiprotich Kiptoo alias Chiloba had a girlfriend. This has been revealed by his childhood and long-time friend Jesca Kiprop. Kiprop said they had not talked much about his relationship, adding that he grew up "just like any other normal person." "He had a girlfriend. That is what I know," she said in an interview with Citizen TV. This is contrary to the belief that Chiloba was part of the LGBTQ+ community. Kiprop further said the model was a social person who related well with his friends from both genders. She added that she knew Chiloba as a morally upright and spiritual man. She said they referred to him as 'Pastor', narrating how at one time he visited her and requested that they pray before taking tea. "Besides kuomba, alikuwa anataguide, vyenye mtu anaeza kupea moral support (Besides Praying, he would guide us in a way that one offers another moral support)," Kiprop said. Chiloba was buried on Tuesday at his parent's home at Sergoit village in Elgeyo Marakwet County. He was found murdered and his body stashed in a metal box which was dumped at Hurlingham village near Kipkaren on the outskirts of Eldoret on January 3, 2023. The investigation into his murder is still ongoing. Five suspects were arrested in connection with Chiloba's murder, including one who confessed to being his lover. Jackton Odhiambo confessed to killing the fashionista for allegedly cheating on him. He told police in Eldoret that he murdered the male model as revenge for betraying him.
