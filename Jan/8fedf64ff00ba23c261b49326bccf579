Retired President Uhuru has for the first time responded to his successor William Ruto's criticism of the Competency-Based Curriculum. The former President on Tuesday said Ruto's Kenya Kwanza government, which vowed to review CBC, will hit a dead end and embrace the curriculum. Uhuru, who spoke when he condoled with former Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha's family, said those who opposed CBC will make an about turn in due time. "People may say whatever they want to say. They will talk and make noise and return to where they were before. Let us give them time to talk, and they will return to where they were before. CBC was not unveiled to hate or spite anyone. It was unveiled to help the children of this Republic," Uhuru said. The President said CBC was designed to prepare Kenyan children for a  radically different future. "It would also prepare Kenyans to face the challenge of this changing world, and we are grateful to him (Magoha) for that. This country has lost a great soldier, a great man, and a sincere individual. He was a loyal man who loved what he truly did," he said. Ruto appointed a task force that is reviewing the CBC curriculum and is expected to submit its final report by next month. The team recommended in December to do away with the Grade 6  tests as the benchmark for transition to Junior Secondary. It also reversed the policy to domicile the JSS in secondary schools. Uhuru hailed Magoha as a gallant servant who drove reforms in the education sector without fear. "He did not have time to enjoy the office. For him, it was about work," he added. "I believe that when I made him a minister, I made the right choice in putting him at the helm of the education sector. He was a man who deserved that position, and he continued to address curriculum challenges and brought on board a new education system,' he said.
