Eldas MP Adan Keynan has denounced a letter purporting that he has resigned. The letter that had been making rounds on social media platforms on Friday stated that the legislator had resigned as the MP for Eldas. Keynan took to Twitter on Saturday describing the content of the letter as unfounded and patchy. "My attention has been drawn to a widespread fake letter with unfounded and patchy information, circulating on social media by purveyors of deceit and misleaders," the MP said. He added that he seeks to bring the matter to the relevant authorities for further investigation. "I wish to notify members of the public to consider the letter fake and disregard the baseless details. I seek to bring the matter to the attention of relevant investigative agencies to swiftly act and pursue the matter to its ultimate end," Keynan said. The letter, which the MP has denied writing, states that he resigns with immediate effect thought the decision was a difficult one to make.
