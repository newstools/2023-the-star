The Fina Stabilisation Committee for Kenya have had their mandated extended by six months to June this year. The mandate was expected to end last December with the national elections but due to technical and administrative challenges including counties' failure to register with the Sports Registrar, the committee have been given a new lease of life by World Aquatics. Speaking on Tuesday Committee member Francis Mutuku said they hope the long-awaited elections in March. "One of the biggest challenges we had is that most counties were not registered with the Sports Registrar as of December. However, most of them have picked up their registration forms and I hope they will be fully compliant by next month," said Mutuku. As of December, only Nairobi, Mombasa, Kajiado and Kiambu had registered with the Sports Registrar. A minimum of eight counties can participate in the elections. Mutuku said they will start the electioneering process as soon as they attain the threshold. This will include sending out the notice for the elections as well as the registration and verification of interested individuals. A stakeholders' meeting is set for February 18. "We will have a meeting with the stakeholders to appraise every one of where we are," Mutuku said. Meanwhile, Mutuku has appealed those involved in the process to move with utmost speed in preparing for the elections in March. â€œI told the stakeholders we can't wait any longer. It's long overdue. We need to get done with the elections as we seek to give the world governing body a reason to lift the current suspension to allow our swimmers return to continue with what they know best," said Mutuku. Kenyan swimmers are at the moment competing under a neutral flag, while they cannot access scholarships and grants from World Aquatics and the IOC, due to the suspension. He said they are also working on a draft calendar of activities for the season and which is expected to be circulated in the next few weeks.
