Debora Cherono and Emily Jerop hope to perform well in this weekend's Athletics Kenya Central Rift cross country championships to earn tickets to the national championships slated for January 21 at Kenya Prisons Staff Training College, Ruiru. The regional meeting is set for Lobo Village, Kapseret where the duo will fly the Uasin Gishu County flag. The pair also expects a quality field from neighbouring Nandi and Baringo counties. Cherono defeated Jerop to lift the Uasin Gishu County title in the 10km senior women’s race on Saturday. The two were the only women participants in the cadre. Cherono timed 40:24.40 with Jerop more than seven minutes 47:03.1. “My specialty is 1,500m but I compete in cross country for speed and endurance. Winning at the county level was good for me even though there was no stiff competition. I look forward to a tougher challenge at the regional level but the aim will be to make it to the nationals," Cherono said. “I am also keen on making Team Kenya, especially on track now that we have the World Championships this year." Jerop said: “So far so good for me in training. I want to make a name in long-distance running even though I specialise in 400m and 800m races. The target is to represent Kenya at some point this year." In the senior men's category, Uasin Gishu will be led by Alvin Kipkorir, Julius Kipkoech and Kelvin Kumutai. In the 8km junior men, Raphael Kelian will team up with Kenneth Kiprop and Elias Kiptoo among others, while Sarah Jepkoech will marshall forces with Dorcas Chesiro and Linah Chebet in the women's race.
