Vipingo's Titianna Atieno has received a golf handicap of 14 — two years after picking up a golf club for the first time during the junior golf clinic run by the Ladies European Tour at Vipingo Ridge in December 2019. The 16-year-old Titianna was invited to try her golf skills under the instruction of the professional players as part of the on-site activities during the inaugural Magical Kenya Ladies Open. Atieno fell in love with the game and started to train twice a week at the exclusive PGA Academy with close mentorship by PGA professional and director of golf Saleem Haji. At the 2022 MKLO, Atieno received further guidance from her golf idols during the second edition of the junior golf clinic held at the PGA Academy in February. Alexandra Swayne, who conducted the clinic in 2022 said: “It was good to teach the kids and show them that no matter where you are or where you come from, it’s good to stick with golf.” Gabrielle MacDonald from Scotland added: “Hopefully we have inspired the kids to play more golf and to enjoy it. It’s great to have role models and have this event in the country to hopefully grow the game.” Atieno has been training on daily basis since sitting for Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations in November last year. She has also spent time at the gym, which has helped in her growth. It is hoped that Atieno’s commitment and talent will see her rise as a strong player on the tournament circuit and become a national success story. It is also hoped that she can take her place alongside Naomi Wafula, Chanelle Wangari, Mercy Nyanchama and other Kenyan junior players at the MKLO 2024. Another 12 junior golfers are expected in this year's clinic slated for February 4.
