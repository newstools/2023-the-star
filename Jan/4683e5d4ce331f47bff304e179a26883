Azimio spokesperson Makau Mutua has said that President William Ruto wants Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi to surpass his Deputy Rigathi Gachagua. In a statement on Saturday, Mutua said that Ruto wants Mudavadi at the top by making Gachagua ineffective. "The so-called gentleman of Kenyan politics Musalia Mudavadi has rarely won a significant political confrontation mano-a-man but he will floor Rigathi because that’s what William Ruto wants. Mr Ruto wants to be the kingpin of Mount Kenya. That’s why he must neuter Mr Gachagua," he said. Recently, Ruto made changes in government by reassigning functions to leaders. Mudavadi was handed sweeping roles at the centre of the delivery of his agenda. Mudavadi's expected larger-than-life stature in the Kenya Kwanza government could offer him political latitude to build a national profile as a formidable force in the Ruto succession matrix. Ruto put Mudavadi in charge of government delivery, technically becoming the man to watch in the execution of President Ruto's development agenda across the country. Gachagua was left to coordinate devolution and chair Cabinet Committees with the actual planning, monitoring, evaluation and delivery of state projects under Mudavadi. Analysts say the President's move is strategic to partly manage expectations in Western Kenya and also assert his authority as the de facto leader of the Kenya Kwanza administration. Other leaders have claimed that Gachagua is being sidelined by President William Ruto. Narok Senator Ledama Olekina said Gachagua will cry the most when the current perceived political happening comes to an end.
