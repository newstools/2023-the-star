Former WCB's Rayvanny has hinted that he might run for a political seat in Mbeya Urban in the forthcoming Tanzanian elections. Through a video shared on his TikTok account, Rayvanny said if all goes well, then he’ll be representing constituents very soon. "Mbunge wa Mbeya Mjini (Member of Parliament of Mbeya Urban)," he said. "Hey, people from Mbeya Urban… God willing, then we will serve you," Vanny Boy announced. The Next Level Music boss seems confident about serving his Mbeya Urban people. In the 2015 elections, hip hop singer Joseph Haule 'Professor Jay', was elected as the MP for Mikuni District on a Chadema (Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo) ticket. Diamond's manager Babu Tale was also elected the MP for the Morogoro Southeast constituency in 2020.
