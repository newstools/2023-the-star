A labour court in Nairobi has suspended the interdiction of IEBC deputy CEO Ruth Kulundu. In its ruling, Employment and Labour Relations Judge Linet Ndolo said Kulundu's dismissal was unlawful. The court noted that IEBC CEO Marjan Marjan violated the IEBC HR policy when the interdiction letter was issued to Kulundu last year. The letter accused Kulundu of impersonation and arranging an illegal commission plenary meeting. During the meeting, four commissioners who disputed the 2022 presidential election results picked law firms that would represent the commission in the presidential election petition filed by Azimio la Umoja One Kenya State House contender Raila Odinga.
