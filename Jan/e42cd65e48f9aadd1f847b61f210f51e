President William Ruto was Wednesday put to task to explain why he missed a wedding ring in an interview with journalists. The President on Wednesday held a two-session interview, in Swahili and English, during which he opened up on a wide range of issues. During the first interview, the ring was conspicuously missing from Ruto's finger. But in the English version interview,Â  Citizen journalist Sam Gituku took notice of the President wearing the ring and inquired why he was missing it earlier. "As we were taking a break from the Swahili episode, you were not wearing a ring and now you have one," he posed. The president laughed off the question and went on to explain himself on the matter. He said he was in a hurry to make it to the interview on time and that is when he forgot the ring. "Sam, you are also the only one wearing a ring here, this one does not have a ring," he said. "I was in a hurry to come here, I was having some meetings in the office and I had to come here. So they told me you have to dress up and go, so in the process of all that, I forgot my ring." He on a light note asked how a serious discussion turned out to be about a missing ring. "It's very interesting that it became a subject of discussion, I thought we were having a very serious conversation here," he said in jest. The president went on to give a brief story of him having a ring. "Let me tell you the story of the ring now that you have asked. You know when Rachel and I got married, we went to a fellow hapo River Road, so we bought rings there, by then it was Sh700. It got tired along the way so ikavunjika(got broken). Rachel is the one who took longer to get a replacement," Ruto narrated.
