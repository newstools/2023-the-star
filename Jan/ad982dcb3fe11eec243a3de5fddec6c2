Narok Senator Ledama Olekina has told off former Nairobi Senator Evans Kidero over his remarks on the Azimio La Umoja rally at Jacaranda. Ledama said he knew about Kidero's "dealing" in the county during his tenure ( 2013-2017), warning him to stop attacking Raila Odinga. "My friend Kidero Evans you know that I Know all about the dealing in Nairobi County 2013-17 things don’t go away easily," he said. "...- please stop boot-licking Williams Ruto by attacking Raila Odinga usiwache mbachao kwa Msala upitao Ndugu! Don't throw away your old rag for a borrowed mat brother," Ledama added. On Sunday, Kidero said Raila should quit with the claims that he won the August 2022, presidential elections. He said elections are won at the polling stations and no one petitioned on the results from the 46,299 stations in the August 2022 elections. "We have 46,299 polling stations and it was the result of the polling stations that were announced. No one came out and said that the votes of certain polling stations were surpassed," he said. Kidero further pointed out that Azimio rejected the results and filed a petition which was dealt with at the Supreme Court. "The elections were done, contested and went to the supreme court. 16 petitions were made and we got our president who is William Ruto. Now claiming that Ruto didn't win is like chasing the wind," he added. Raila on Sunday asked President William Ruto to accept that he did not win the August 2022 presidential elections. "Accept that you were defeated in the election, leave State House for Baba to get in. We are speaking the truth, we do not want war, and we do not want threats. We have our rights as Kenyans, and they can not be snatched by a hawk, Kenyans deserve a leader that they elected," Raila said. In a rejoinder, the former Governor said it was unrealistic to demand that  Ruto vacates the State House. "You have to be elected and be sworn in before you move into the State House," he said.
