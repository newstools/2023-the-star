President William Ruto has scheduled a meeting with the leadership of the council of governors (COG) today as the ongoing Cabinet retreat enters its third day. It is during the meeting where the head of state will discuss areas of collaboration between the two levels of government. Health is among the functions shared between the two levels and the president has promised to ensure the bottlenecks hampering effective service delivery are addressed. “The health sector is one that needs change. The universal health coverage (UHC) plan cannot wait... I had to delay my health plan so that I can sort out issues at the NHIF first,” said Ruto during a media interview on Wednesday. The president is also expected to hold a separate meeting with the leadership from the Senate and National Assembly. He will emphasise his agenda and explore ways in which the two Houses can work with his cabinet. He has already signalled his intentions of having the CSs appear in parliament to answer questions. "We are going to agree with them how they are going to work with us so that it is possible for the cabinet secretaries to go before parliament and explain our plan and prosecute it," Ruto said Friday. "Our administration is as good as the checks and balances that exist and therefore we are ready to subject ourselves to accountability and to oversight so that before it is too late we can know whether things are going right or not so right and we can be able to know what to do."
