Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has told popular Mugithi star Samuel Muchoki also known as Samidoh to take control of his relationships and avert perennial chaos. The DP was referringÂ to the drama that ensued between him, his wife Edday Nderitu and nominated Senator Karen Nyamu in Dubai. Gachagua Samidoh has earned the respect of many through his music compositions and should now restore order in his family and ensure decency prevails. "Sasa wewe Samidoh ucontrol watu wako. Panga panga hiyo maneno yako na ukishindwa, tutakukataza kwenda ng'ambo," said Gachagua in jest. Loosely translates to: "Samidoh control your people. Control your people and if you fail we shall ban you from travelling abroad". He said that when he goes out to perform in a foreign country, he should keep in mind many foreign countries do not appreciate polygamy. Gachagua was speaking during the funeral service of Trade CS Moses Kuria's sister Pauline Nyokabi. Samidoh was present. In December, a video clip went viral online showing Nyamu and Samido's wife Edday embroiled in a bitter fight at a concert in Dubai where Samidoh was performing. The clash between the two saw Nyamu forcibly ejected from the dias and whisked away by the security guard. In a separate clip, Nyamu was filmed dancing on stage as Samidoh and Akorino singer Karangu Muraya entertained revellers. It was during that moment that she was whisked away after another altercation ensued. The senator later blamed her actions on alcohol, a habit she vowed to quit come January this year. A section of Kenyans called for her expulsion from the party saying she had breached Chapter Six of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity. Nyamu was summoned to appear before UDA Disciplinary Committee probing her recent conduct. The senator had been scheduled to appear before the committee on Friday morning but she wrote to the committee requesting a postponement of the hearing. She appeared before the committee on Friday 20, 2023.
