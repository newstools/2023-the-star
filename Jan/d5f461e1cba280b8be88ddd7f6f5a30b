Inspector General of police Japhet Koome has told off political leaders claiming they can influence the transfer of his police officers. He said there are politicians addressing members of the public while claiming that they are going to transfer or dismiss some police officers. He said nothing of the sort will happen. “Such utterances are null and void. The National Police Service is an independent Constitutional Office with direction and command under the Inspector General,” he said. He told the leaders, especially politicians, to refrain from making public utterances likely to cause disaffection within the National Police Service. He directed all Police Commanders to continue discharging their official duties professionally without favor or fear of intimidation. A section of political leaders especially in some places in Rift Valley have been threatening police officers with transfers and sacking for unknown reasons. Others have cited insecurity in their areas to issue threats to police officers.
