Mean Machine coach Nick Abok says the team needs to improve their set-piece and defensive play as the Kenya Cup resumes on Saturday. The three-time Kenya Cup champions are currently 11th on the log with just two points following a winless streak four matches into the new season. Abok believes they are headed in the right direction, optimistic that they can get themselves off the drop zone by getting results in their three matches this month. "From the four matches played, we have had an indifferent display in set-pieces and our scrum and line-out have not been good. These facets form the bedrock of 15s rugby and if we get it right, then we can start winning matches and get off the relegation zone,” noted Abok. On defence, the former Impala academy coach said change of players has seen them struggle and believes a settled squad heading to the new year will help them improve. “We have shipped in 175 points due to the unavailability of some players but I am confident we have had valuable training sessions and strategic meetings that will help us improve on our performances this year, especially our alignment in defence,” said Abok. The varsity side opened their campaign with a 42-6 loss to Menengai Oilers before falling 41-0 to champions Kabras. They then drew 17-17 with Catholic Monks before losing 45-20 to Quins. Abok said the club's target for the season is to avoid relegation. “Our goal is to ensure we play top flight rugby next season," said Abok. Machine are scheduled to play Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST), Homeboyz and Nakuru, matches Abok considers winnable. 'They are all matches we can win. I am happy that our attack is scoring tries and we just need to tighten our defensive end, scrum and line-out to ensure we are competitive in those three matches,” noted Abok. The top four teams in the league will head to the semifinals with the bottom two relegated to the Championship.
