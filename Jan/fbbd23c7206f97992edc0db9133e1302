Rapper Khaligraph Jones says patience has made him a great rapper globally. Speaking in an interview while in Sierra Leone, Khaligraph said his journey in the industry has not been smooth. "I believe in patience and that is why I am considered great and the best rapper in Kenya so far," he said. Khaligraph said he no longer takes trolls seriously. "I have also learnt to be calm about everything that is said about me online," he said. The rapper performed to a packed crowd of thousands that were hyped throughout the night and sang along to all his songs as he owned the stage, bringing his lyrics to life. He wrote on his social media handles: "Sierra Leone guys love Hip Hop! I performed 'Lwanda Magere Legacy' for the first time and they were rapping along."
