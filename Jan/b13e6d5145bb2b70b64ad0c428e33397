An elderly man living outside Kiambu level five hospital in Kiambu county for two months is appealing for help from well-wishers to help trace back his home in Taita Taveta county. Joseph Mureithi said that he ended up on the streets after he was discharged from Kiambu level five hospital where he had been admitted and left by his kin. “I was brought by people known to me from Taita Taveta to Kiambu hospital where I was left and since I was discharged I have nowhere to go that is why I have pitched camp outside the hospital,” Mureithi said. Mureithi said that he sent a well-wisher who offered to help to find his sister who lives in Mwea Kirinyaga county. “Someone came here and I do not know him and offered to find my sister who lives in Mwea. I wanted to go live with her as I have no other siblings. All of them have passed away,” Mureithi said. Mureithi said that he has been depending on handouts from well-wishers to survive. Serah Wanjiru a Kiambu town resident said that the man risks getting sick as he spends nights in the cold. “The man seems not to have a recollection of his home since he says all his kin died. Another time he says that he has a sister in Mwea. He lives in the cold with no one looking after him and seems not to be in his right senses,” wanjiru said. She called on wellwishers to unite and help the old man get into an elderly people’s home as he awaits to be traced by his people. “Two months living out in the cold for a man who looks like he is over 80 years old is not good and we need to come together and help the man enter an elderly home.”
