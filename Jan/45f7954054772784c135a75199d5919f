Tusker FC head coach Robert Matano wants his players to be at their best fitness-wise as they head to Mbaraki Stadium for a clash against hosts Bandari on Sunday. Matano said the Kenyan Premier League leaders struggled at home in Wednesday's 2-1 victory over the bottom-placed Vihiga Bullets. Tusker looked rusty in the match, despite having come off a six-match-winning streak that saw them top the log and Matano is now concerned. The seasoned gaffer attributed the team's drop in form to the long holiday break, which left them gasping for breath against their inexperienced opponents. "We've just come off the holiday season and most players appear to be struggling to regain match sharpness.Â To win in football, you must put in a lot of effort and maintain the momentum," Matano stated. "It has always been our tradition to play with purpose but I noticed that we didn't know what to do with the ball against Vihiga. This, I believe, is due to a lack of team training." Despite the pitfalls, Matano has promised to improve their act. "On the plus side, we identified our weak points, which we will address before traveling to Mombasa to face Bandari. We panicked a lot in front of goal and wasted a lot of chances (against Vihiga)," he said. "That must change in our next game. We should reduce unnecessary excitement and anxiety as we prepare to attack," he added. Other matches on Sunday include Posta Rangers hosting Gor Mahia at Thika Stadium.
