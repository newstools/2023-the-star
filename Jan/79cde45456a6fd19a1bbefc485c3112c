Opposition leader Raila Odinga claims there is  a "political standoff" in Kenya and has called on the UN and Commonwealth Secretariat to come in and resolve it. In reality, there is no standoff and the business of government is proceeding smoothly (but not perfectly). Indeed Raila himself instructed governors in Nyanza to cooperate with President Ruto when he visited the region earlier this month. The so-called 'standoff' is just a series of rallies, which most of Raila's lieutenants decline to attend. Raila claims the August 9 presidential election was rigged, although the Supreme Court and IEBC disagreed. Raila was effectively the state candidate so it would be surprising if the outsider managed to rig the election in his favour. Political expert Charles Hornsby has examined the anonymous whistleblower report from Vanguard Africa and concluded that it is largely a forgery. Azimio has not produced a single altered Form 34A, arguing that the rigging took place with the consolidated Form 34Bs. But Ruto was the winner, if you add up all the Form 34As on the IEBC website. Raila should accept that he lost the election and concentrate on being an effective leader of the official opposition.
