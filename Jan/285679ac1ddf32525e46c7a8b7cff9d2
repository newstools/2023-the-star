Kenya Red Cross has continued to distribute food stuffs among the most vulnerable populations in Isiolo county. On Friday and Saturday, the agency distributed food to residents in Burat on the outskirts of Isiolo town, Kipsing and Lenguruma villages in Isiolo North. Kenya Red Cross Isiolo county coordinator Gregory Macharia said that many residents remain in dire situation in the county. "As a branch we have gotten assistance from Kenya Association of Manufacturers to assist 1000 households with food aid," he said. "The food package contains 20kg of rice, 5kg green grams, 1kg of salt and one litre of oil to reduce impact of drought to communities," he added. Macharia noted that approximately 60 per cent of Isiolo population are said to be food insecure as a result of the drought. Lunguruma resident Purity Namaiyo urged for more aid. "The drought has killed cattle and camels which we depend on. The rains have not come and we are continuing to lose cattle, so we urge county and national governments to continue intervening," she said. During a press briefing on drought update earlier this week, EAC, ASALS and Regional Development CS Rebecca Miano said the drought situation remains critical in 22 of the 23 Asal counties. She said at least 4.35 million Kenyans are in dire need of relief food. Isiolo is one of the nine counties said to be in alarm drought phase.
