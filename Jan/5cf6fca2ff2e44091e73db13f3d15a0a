Tanzania's former presidential candidate, Tundu Lissu, is expected to return to his home country on Wednesday from exile in Belgium. The opposition leader returns home after the government recently lifted a ban on political rallies, and he is expected to address supporters later in the afternoon. The ban, imposed by former president John Magufuli in 2016, allowed only elected politicians to conduct rallies in their constituencies. Lissu was shot 16 times in an assassination attempt in 2017 in the country's capital, Dodoma, and has spent most of the years since in Belgium. He then returned for a few months in 2020 to challenge Mr Magufuli in a presidential election where he only secured 13% of the votes. His Chadema party rejected the outcome over claims of widespread irregularities.
