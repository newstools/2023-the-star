A couple has drowned in a dam at Toll area within Juja, Kiambu county after their car plunged into the dam in a suspected suicide case. The lovebirds were making merry inside their car which they had parked near the dam before the incident occurred on Tuesday evening. Revellers have been thronging the area for "park and chill" activities while indulging in merry-making. According to witnesses, an argument broke out between the two and the man ignited the car and reversed into the dam. Martin Ngugi, a diver, told the Star that they managed to retrieve the body of the middle-aged woman on Tuesday evening but failed to locate the man's body and the car. However, they managed to locate the man's body and the car on Wednesday morning, Ngugi said. "We only managed to retrieve the body of the woman. She had tried to swim and had moved towards the bank but didn't make it. We have already located where the car is and the man's body," Ngugi said. The man's body was finally retrieved on Wednesday and taken to General Kago Funeral Home together with the woman's body. By the time of going to press efforts to retrieve the car were ongoing. Some residents called on the relevant authorities including the Kiambu county government to ensure the dam is fenced to avert such incidents. George Kagochi, a resident said that the dam has become a death trap to residents and visitors. He said one year ago four students drowned while having fun. "There have been countless incidences where people have lost their lives in this dam. It's high time our leaders expedite fencing of the dam to put an end to these incidences," Kagochi said. Murera Ward MCA Moses Ngatha said they will move a motion at the county assembly to compel the county government to fence the dam. "We will also explore ways in which we can turn the dam into an income or revenue-generating facility," Ngatha said.
