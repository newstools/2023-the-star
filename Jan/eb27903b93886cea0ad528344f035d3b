@Alicewangechi Only 25 per cent of Kandara voters had cast their ballots by 1 pm on Thursday. UDA secretary general Veronica Maina who visited the constituency to inspect the voting process said though the turnout has been extremely low. “The exercise is peaceful and we are looking forward to a successful day but the only challenge is low voter turnout,” she said. However, Maina was hopeful that voters will come out in numbers in the afternoon to exercise their constitutional right and vote for their candidate. She said there were few claims of voter bribery by some of the candidates but that the information has not been verified. “We are on the lookout to ensure the process is not interfered with and the voice of Kandara people is heard,” Maina said. The constituency has 105,148 voters and 197 polling centres spread out in six wards.
