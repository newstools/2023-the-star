Kenya Wildlife Service Director General Erastus Kanga has announced that there are plans to upgrade the Kasala Gate at Tsavo East National Park. This will help increase visitation to the area, through the gate used by visitors coming in through Kitui County. "We plan to upgrade this gate to increase visitation and support the livelihoods of local communities living adjacent to the park," he said. Kanga spoke on Sunday, January 1,2023 when he visited Ithumba in the Northern part of Tsavo East National Park. He lauded the staff for their work, saying their dedication to the remote part of the park made them an inspiration, to work with. "We shared New Year's lunch, and I reaffirmed my support for ranger welfare, facilitation, and empowerment," Kanga said.
