President William Ruto has come clean on the recently dropped cases by the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji saying he played no role in any of them. His reaction comes after cases facing several of his allies were dropped by the DPP. The DPP dropped cases against DP Rigathi Gachagua, CS Public Service and Gender Aisha Jumwa and Agriculture CS Mithika Linturi among others. The cases were dropped weeks after Ruto was sworn in as President. "The people of Kenya, William Ruto your President had nothing to do with the dropped cases by DPP against not just the three but any other case," he said. The President however came to the defence of the accused saying that Kenyans know that the criminal justice system was mobilized by the previous administration to achieve political ends. "Otherwise for your information with all these cases, how did we get ourselves elected," he questioned "And if all this was true, are you telling me the seven million plus Kenyans who said no, these are the right people to lead our country were in darkness or in the dark?" The president explained that the people of Kenya can determine what is right from what is wrong. "If Gachagua had anything to do with that matter these people would have jailed him a long time ago," he stated.
