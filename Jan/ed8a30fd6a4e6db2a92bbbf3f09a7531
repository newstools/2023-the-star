Football Kenya Federation(FKF) Kakamega branch chairman Allan Muhando wants leaders across the county to come up with sports academies in a bid to tap into the large raw talent that is readily available in the region. Speaking during Charles Lwanga's football tournament at Mukumu Boys High School, Muhando said there are many talented young boys and girls in the region who need support. He said FKF will help in scouting talented footballers through grassroots tournaments with a view to expose them to local clubs. “If leaders and the government can put emphasis on talent search and nurturing, it will help solve the issue of unemployment in this country," he added. "FKF is ready to work with the government and all leaders in this county to ensure talented youngsters are supported," said Muhando. Isukha South MCA, who organized the tournament, said the tourney was not for political gain but to showcase talent in his ward. “Apart from showcasing our talented boys and girls in this ward, I want to support those interested in refereeing. I will liaise with the FKF officials to have them trained as referees to the level they want,” he added. He promised to ensure the famous Khayega Sports ground is renovated. The same ground has produced the likes of internationals Nick Yakhama, Reginald Asibwa, Boniface Ambani, and Washington Muhanji among others.
