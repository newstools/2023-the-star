President William Ruto's daughter Charlene Ruto has said 2022 taught her to accept who she is. In her New Year's message, Charlene urged others to do the same, accepting and embracing themselves wholly. "2022 taught me to accept who I am. Accept who you are. Embrace and love that greatness within you, the influence you wield and the compassion you have for others," she said. The President's third-born daughter urged others to learn to acknowledge that at times, they will lack answers to challenges in life. She, however, said one has to be willing to take the risks needed to leave their legacy. Charlene became a subject on social media since her father won the August 2022 presidential elections. Just after Ruto took office, Kenyans wondered what her role was in the new government. This followed her visits to different county assemblies, holding meetings with governors and running different initiatives. She was compared to former US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump. Further, Charlene trended on social media after a video of her claiming that she sold 'smokies' while at the university, emerged. This was at the time when Ruto was Deputy President. "I was in Daystar University and smokie kachumbari was the only thing that was selling, I was encouraged to take up the small business," she said. The video received mixed reactions among Kenyans, with some tweeps claiming that she was lying. However, she defended her claims by saying that she had witnessed it. "I was somewhere talking to some university students. We were talking about savings and investment, so I thought to encourage them and tell them my story when I used to sell smokie kachumbari at Daystar," she said. On yet another occasion, Charlene caused another social media storm after she said that she holds the Office of the First Daughter. She however clarified that the office is not taxpayer funded.
