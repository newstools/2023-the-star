Residents of Murang'a will start accessing county services digitally, as the county government automates its services. Governor Irungu Kang'ata on December 31, 2022 announced that as of January 1, 2023 all county government services will be automated. "From January 1, 2023 county government of Murang'a will automate certain revenue streams," he said, The services include parking, markets, hospital, quarry and veterinary. Residents will have to dial *267#and follow the steps in order to be registered first before accessing the services they need. In September 2022, Governor Kang'ata launched the piloting of a revenue-collecting technology that he said was expected to double revenue collection. The system, Kang’ata said had proven to be successful and will ensure the county government achieves its targets. The digital revenue collection system was being used to collect revenue in parking lots within Murang’a town, the county referral hospital, Mukuyu and Maragua markets and in quarries. The governor said the increase in revenue collected is an indication that the automation has helped to seal loopholes that were previously used to siphon funds by workers. With the manual systems, only about Sh50 million was collected monthly with county workers accused of using fake receipts to charge fees and pocket the money. The county has over 400 staffers distributed across the eight sub-counties, making it hard to monitor their activities but with the automation, they are denied access to cash and will only play a supervisory role of ensuring individuals pay the necessary fees. Kang’ata said his aim is to ensure the county collects over Sh200 million each month which he said will ensure residents get more services.
