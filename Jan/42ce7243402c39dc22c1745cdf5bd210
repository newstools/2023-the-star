"Graham Potter must be thinking when is his luck going to change." Ex-Chelsea forward Joe Cole said what was on the mind of many of the club's fans - and Potter himself. A horrendous run of form, unhappy supporters, an increasingly lengthy injury list and now their star new signing is suspended for three games after being sent off on his debut. Chelsea, European champions a year and a half ago, are 10th in the Premier League after losing 2-1 to west London rivals Fulham at Craven Cottage - and once again the Blues were the architects of their own downfall. Portugal winger Joao Felix had looked Chelsea's best player and been at the heart of their best attacking moments before he lunged and caught Fulham defender Kenny Tete on the shin and was shown a straight red card. "Joao was having a fantastic impact and now to lose him for three games is really disappointing," said Potter. "He didn't want to hurt anybody and it's a football action that can happen. "It's where we are in terms of things that can happen for us. It is another blow, the hits keep coming at the moment. We are suffering. Anything that can go wrong, is going wrong. "It was a forward's tackle, there was no malice in it but I understand why it was a red. He was really good, you could see his quality in the game so it is doubly disappointing for us." Chelsea had been the better team but fell behind when teenage full-back Lewis Hall and central defender Trevoh Chalobah both failed to clear the ball and ex-Chelsea man Willian scored with a deflected shot. But Potter's side equalised within two minutes of the second half as Kalidou Koulibaly reacted quickest after Mason Mount's free-kick had hit the post, and Chelsea looked on top. But the advantage did not last long as Joao Felix, who only joined Chelsea on loan from Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, was sent off before the hour mark, with Carlos Vinicius heading in a 72nd-minute winner for the hosts.
