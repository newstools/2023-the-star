A number of parents in Nakuru are keeping their children busy during this long school holiday by enlisting them for training and indoor games at the National Library. Trainer Michael Makanda said indoor games such chess and monopoly are not only entertaining for children but they help improve their concentration, which is a key requirement for innovation and learning. During an interview with KNA he said the children are trained at a fee. Makanda said the children whom he has trained excel in mathematics because they develop higher levels of concentration, which enables them to read on their own without being coaxed by parents. He said some indoor games such as chess can easily be turned into professions, and those who excel earn a lot of money compared to white collar jobs. He encouraged parents to keep their children busy to avoid negative trappings at estates and society at large. He said monopoly is the best training for children on financial matters since it teaches them on budgeting, paying utility bills and paying taxes. The eight-week holiday was the longest that school children have enjoyed since Covid-19 hit the country three years ago. Librarian in-charge Purity Mutuku said they are excited because Nakuru residents keep on encouraging their children to spend more and more time at the ultra-modern library. She said access to free Wi-Fi was a major attraction for teenagers and other youths to their library, which is always full to capacity.
