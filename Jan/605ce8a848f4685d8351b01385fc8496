An elderly woman escaped death after rowdy residents in Sikusi village, Bungoma county attacked her over allegations of practicing witchcraft. They invaded her house after accusations from some residents and destroyed some items she allegedly uses for witchcraft. Speaking to the press on Thursday, Mildred Nekesa, a village elder said the woman has been behaving strangely since she rented a house at Sikusi market. “The suspect has stayed here for some time but her behavior has not been appealing to us,” she said. Nekesa said among the things they torched in her house included— dry chicken, certificates, pieces of clothes and politicians posters among other items. She said the woman managed to escape after seeing the rowdy residents coming for her. “We are still searching for her, we have almost combed the entire village but our efforts hit a snag,” she said.
