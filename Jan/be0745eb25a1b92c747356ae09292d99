The late Education CS George Magoha somewhat knew his time to leave this world had come hours before he collapsed and died. His colleague Walter Mwanda told the media at Lee Funeral Home where Magoha's remains were taken after his death on Tuesday that he had a premonition he was going to die. "He had a premonition and told his wife, I suppose, that his time had come and he was happy everything was done," he said. "He then asked the wife to call the son and also the daughter in-law and then at that time he also said he wanted to see me and the wife did the same. Called the soon, called the daughter in-law and called me in that series," Mwanda narrated. He said the call came through at around 3pm while he was attending to a patient at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Mwanda said he handed over to a colleague and headed straight to the late former CS's home. He revealed that the CS had been extremely busy over the past few days following his engagement in the preparation of his late brother Alex's burial. Mwanda said the body of the younger brother was coincidentally supposed to arrive in Kenya from the US on Tuesday. "May I say that for the first time he didn't reply to my call on Saturday but then later on I called him using another number and we discussed the way forward with regards to his brother's death." Mwanda said Magoha collapsed at least four times before he was pronouncedÂ dead at the Nairobi Hospital where he was rushed.
