Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's son Muhoozi Kainerugaba has caused mixed reactions among Kenyans after he asked whether Westlands is still up for sale. On Tuesday, Kainerugaba took to Twitter to inquire whether Westlands is on sale. Some bashed him while others supported him. "Is Westlands still up for sale?" he asked. Mkenya Mwenyewe said, "If you were unable to take up the western part of Kenya Busia how sure are you that it will be possible to buy Westlands..? Anyway it's good to dream and continue dreaming." Muhoozi has been in the media limelight since early October when he threatened Kenya with military invasion and the capture of Nairobi. "It wouldn't take us and my army 2 weeks to capture Nairobi," he tweeted. KOT reacted to the veiled threat resulting in a series of back-and-forth. Muhoozi later retracted his abrasive remarks saying he was just joking. On October 13, Muhoozi asked President William Ruto to forgive him over the tweets. "I have never had any problem with Afande Ruto. If I made a mistake anywhere, I ask him to forgive me as his young brother. God bless East Africa!" he tweeted. Museveni rewarded his eldest son with a promotion in the military by elevating him to a full General.
