Fresh from winning the East Africa Sevens title, Strathmore Leos turn their attention to climbing the Kenya Cup table when action resumes this weekend.. The Madaraka-based outfit are ninth on the log and coach Louis Kisia believes their 14-10 win over Uganda's Kyambogo University is a big boost ahead ahead of their encounter against Mwamba. "Winning breeds confidence and although the Ugandan event was on Sevens format, my players are highly-motivated as we target a good run in the league," said Kisia. Leos won their opening match of the season by beating another university side, Masinde Muliro University, 23-21. However, that was the only win they have in their campaign so far after defeats to Homeboyz (22-15) and Nakuru (26-12) with Kisia attributing the defeats to the departure of some of his trusted generals. "We are integrating new players to the squad and its taking time to adjust. However, I am confident we can string a couple of wins in the New Year and move up the table,” added Kisia. Among the players who have left are Simbas number 8 Bethwell Anami — who secured a professional contract in France — utility back Andrew Matoka got a scholarship in the United States of America while winger Matthew Mogaye has been ruled out for the remainder of the season with a meniscus injury. However, Leos have secured an educational scholarship for Gabriel Ayimba, who joins from Quins alongside Kisumu duo of Vincent Ochieng  and Dennis Tubei. Skipper Gabriel Adero returns from a short sojourn in Qatar. Kisia said they are going to tweak their game plan in this month's fixtures which also pit them against Catholic Monks and KCB. He said his target is to finish third to guarantee themselves a home semifinal.
