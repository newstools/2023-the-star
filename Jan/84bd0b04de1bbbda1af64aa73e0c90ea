Late Education CS George Magoha's widow Barbara Odudu Magoha has disclosed why she chose him for a husband. Speaking at their Lavington home on Tuesday after former President Uhuru Kenyatta visited them, Barbara disclosed that she loved Magoha because he believed in family, and always encouraged her. "So many people asked me why I left Nigerians. He was unique, he had a caring attitude which I never saw anywhere, he was loyal, if he told me he would see me at 2 o'clock, he would show up at that time," she said. She also said her husband was forgiving. "During our argument, I would say I had a headache. He would stop arguing and take care of me saying what we were arguing about was over," she narrated. At the same time, she disclosed that the toughest period of their marriage was during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time, she disclosed that Magoha had to make frequent travels and meet people owing to the nature of his work. "I told him if this is the way you were meant to go, then you will go. We had to take the risk," she said. Barbara said her family was exposed to the virus as they are all medical practitioners. "As much as he was not practising medicine, my son, and my daughter-in-law were all exposed. We were like if it happens, it happens, but we must soldier on," she said. Uhuru accompanied by his former Cabinet colleagues visited the family to console them. Magoha will be buried on February 11 at his rural home in Siaya county.
