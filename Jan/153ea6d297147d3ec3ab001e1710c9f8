Kikuyu council of elders has called for the reconciliation between retired President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. Speaking on Sunday, the council led by national chairman Wachira Kiago said the duo are the most senior leaders in the region and they should speak in one voice. "Hakuna haja tuone wakipigana..hao wawili ni viongozi wetu na tunawauliza kama wazee, waanze kukaa chini tuone kama community tunaelekea wapi.(There's no need to see them fighting. They are our leaders and as elders, we are asking them to sit down and tell us where we are heading as a community),"Â  he said. The elders also called for the end of the political rift that was brought in the region during pre and post-August 2022 elections. They asked politicians from the different parties to also unite and take Mt Kenya's agenda forward. The elders commended President William Ruto's effort to unite the country post elections. They urged him to continue with the same spirit until he leave the most powerful seat. "Ruto should continue leading in unity. He has demonstrated his desire to unite the country and he should do that until he leaves the presidency," Kiago said. The leaders spoke during their annual national prayers held at Ol Kalou town.
