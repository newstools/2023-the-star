Singer Wahu cried for three months when her dad died. While paying tribute to him, the mother of three said her late dad spoke to her, asking her to move on from the depressive state she was in. "... I was finally able to get out of bed and get back to 'life' 10 years on. We remember you and miss you," she said. "You will forever be in our hearts. Continue resting in peace, Papa. I love you, I love you, I love you." She described her late dad as her best friend. Wahu remembered her dad as a mentor to so many during his times. Wahu added that her dad would have been so excited to meet her daughter Shiro as he loved children very much.
