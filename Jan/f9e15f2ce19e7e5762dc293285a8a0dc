Ex- IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has threatened to sue Azimio leader Raila Odinga over his statements during the Jacaranda rally on Sunday. In a letter dated January 31, Chebukati's lawyer, Steve Ogolla, gave Raila an ultimatum to release the video footage of the former chairman's visit within seven days. "In the circumstances of your allegations, and in the context of our client's strong rebuttal thereto, our instructions are to demand from you, as of right, which we hereby do, to be furnished with the alleged video footage within seven days from the date hereof," the letter reads. In case the given days pass without Raila giving in to the demand, Chebukati's lawyers will be forced to take legal action. "In doing so, we shall take such action as necessary to protect our client's right to access to information by dint of Article 35(1)(b) of the Constitution without further reference to you whatsoever, holding you liable for costs and any other consequences which may arise therefrom," Ogolla added. Speaking on Sunday, Raila said Chebuakti and former Commissioners Abdi Guliye and Boya Molu visited his home, wondering why they claimed that some people tried to bribe them but they have not said why they visited his home. Raila said they asked him for something, adding that he had proof. "Chebukati is saying there are people who tried to bribe him, even his other colleagues Guliye and Molu. I want to ask them what did you come to do at my house? What did they ask me for? I have pictures and if they continue playing I will make them public," he said. The chief opposition leader further said the three also visited former CS Raphael Tuju's home and he has video evidence. In Tuesdayâ€™s letter, Chebukati denied the claims. "In response to your allegations, our client vehemently denies that he met you during the election year, let alone the election period, and in particular, at your home, as alleged by yourself.
