Azimio Leader Raila Odinga has recounted how he was once arrested in Lagos, Nigeria when he was observing an election. Speaking at the 2022 leadership conference and awards, Raila said it was 2003 when the incident happened. He said during the election, one was not supposed to be driving but he was on the road. "I was told, don't you know that today people are not supposed to be driving?, the driver told him, I'm carrying an Oga, and we had a sticker. The officer asked who I was and said I was an observer," he said. Raila said the officer had mistaken him for a Nigerian and had to provide his passport for proof. "The officer asked if I was Nigerian, and said no, 'come on, don't play with us, you are a Nigerian.' Eventually, when I showed my passport he realised I was not a Nigerian and that is when I was arrested," he said. Raila left the country for Nigeria on Monday. The 14th annual Leadership Conference and Awards is themed; â€˜Credible Elections and Economy in Transition'. "It feels great to be in Abuja, Nigeria for the 2022 Leadership Conference and Awards tomorrow! Let's learn, connect, and celebrate together," he tweeted. The conference comes at a time the ODM leader is pushing for 'electoral justice' following what he terms as a sham election of August 9, 2022.
