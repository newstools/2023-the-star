A section of Maasai professionals from Narok has told Senator Ledama ole Kina to tone down his attacks on Governor Patrick Ntutu. They called on him to seek an audience with the governor and discuss on development agenda of the county and the way forward. Led by John Saruni Reson, they termed Ledama's 'persistent' remarks as unwarranted and in bad taste. The former Narok East Parliamentary aspirant called on Senator Ledama to respect the governor and allow him to do his constitutional mandate instead of attacking him through the media. "He should seek dialogue with him and articulate issues he feels the governor was not doing instead of undermining the county administration." Reson spoke when he led the Maa professionals in a presser to welcome President William Ruto ahead of his planned visit to the county on Sunday. Ruto is set to attend an interdenominational church service to be held at William Ole Ntimama Stadium. "All leaders must be accorded the respect they deserve and supported by all residents for them to be able to work in tandem and deliver pledges of the current government," said Reson. Ntutu said Ledama may not grace President Ruto's event. Olekina responded to Governor Patrick Ole Ntutu laughing off the idea that he would even attend the event. "Governor of Narok Ole Ntutu is smoking leaves of Mary Jane instead of the real thing! In his right mind does he think I can attend a UDA rally ?" he posed.
