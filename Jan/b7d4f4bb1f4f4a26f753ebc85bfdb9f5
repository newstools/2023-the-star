The National Lands Commission chairperson Gerishom Otachi has said he is ready to work with President William Ruto to achieve his development goals. “We will commit the president’s appointees to support him in the implementation of the constitution. My fellow commissioners heard clearly what the president wants,” Otachi said. He spoke to the Star on Saturday after taking a delegation of commissioners to the State House on Tuesday. Otachi said the meeting with the President was aimed at inaugurating a collaborative plan between the executive, commissions and independent offices towards the full implementation of the constitution. He said all his members are in top gear and are ready to walk closely with the head of state in moving the country forward. During the Tuesday meeting, President William Ruto said constitutional commissions and independent offices are integral to the prosperity and stability of Kenya. The institutions, he said, are essential to Kenya's democracy and their leadership is a critical factor in their success. "The promise of our constitution is partly dependent on the integrity and vigilance of commissions and independent offices. They are the auditors of the auditors; they watch over the watchmen,” Ruto said. The President cited IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and the experience of the August 9 polls. "That is what integrity looks like when working for the people of Kenya; standing with the constitution, braving pressure and resisting threats," he said.
