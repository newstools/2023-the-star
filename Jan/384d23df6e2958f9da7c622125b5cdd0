A Kakamega court has nullified the election of Lugari MCA Amutete Grey. Amutete was elected MCA on the UDP party ticket. The court cited malpractice in the August 2022 general elections and the failure of IEBC to adhere to guidelines as reasons for the nullification. His opponent in the elections, William Makhalanya had filed a petition challenging the win. Makhalanya said the elections had been marred with irregularities. In the case, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission returning officer in the area had been listed as the second respondent. Amutete was declared the winner after polling 1,764 votes. The ruling came after the Orange party's Geoffrey Mitalo filed a complaint claiming that the party did not follow due process in making the nomination.
