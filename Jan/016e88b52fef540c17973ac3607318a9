Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has extended his good deeds to Busia County. On Saturday, the county boss who was attending a burial in Busia, announced that he will pay school fees for a young boy who approached Him crying at the funeral. Carlos Baraza sat for his Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams in 2022 and scored 354 marks. However, due to lack of fees, he had no hope of joining secondary school next month. "Carlos Baraza is a blessed and brave young man. Carlos came up to me crying in the middle of my condolence message at Mzee Magoba’s funeral in Busia," Sakaja said. "He got 354 in KCPE but had no hope due to lack of fees. I will sponsor him for the entire 4 years of High School and University," he added. The Nairobi Governor also expressed confidence that the boy would be successful in life, while pledging to pay his school fees until he completes university campus. “Carlos will go far in life. I will sponsor him for the entire four years of high school and university thereafter," Sakaja added. Last year in October, the Governor had also extended his arm of kindness and saved Deputy Rigathi Gachagua impersonator Zakaria Kariuki, alias, KK Mwenyewe from deferring from his university studies. Kariuki announced that Sakaja had cleared his tuition fee balance of Ksh10,900 a day before the payment deadline. "After I posted my issue on fees, many of my fans offered to help. I want to thank Sakaja for paying my fees. Thank you and God bless you all," eh said.
