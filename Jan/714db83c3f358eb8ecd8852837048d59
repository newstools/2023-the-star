National 100m record holder Maximila Imali wants to become the first woman sprinter to represent Kenya at the World Championships. Speaking at the track and field season opener at Mumias Sports Complex in Kakamega County, where she bagged the 100m title in 11.7, Imali said she is targeting to attain 11.0 seconds qualifying time. The Kenya Police athlete has a personal best time of 11.19 secs and faces a herculean task to improve her time ahead of the World Athletics Championships set for August 19-27 in Budapest, Hungary. During the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Imali who is coached by Perpetua Mbutu, finished fifth in the semi-finals. To help her achieve her dream, her manager Lee-Roy Newton has lined up pre-season training in South Africa and races in Europe to help her meet the qualifying standards. “My problem is that I ran out of gas in the last 40m in Birmingham. However, I will work on that so that I achieve my dream of representing Kenya at the World Championships,” she said. Coach Mbutu said they are focusing on Imali’s mental strength which she says is her weak point. “I’m very confident that by the time we go for trials, she will be mentally strong,” said Mbutu. During the two-day AK sprints, middle distance and field events build-up in Mumias, Imali beat Monica Safenia (11.9) and Eunice Kadogo (12.1) to second and third places respectively. World Under-20 400m silver medalist Damaris Nduleve, 17,  stole the show in Mumias by clinching the women's 200 and 400m races. She also anchored her team to victory in the 4x400m relay. Nduvele leaves for specialized training in France next week. In 200m, Nduleve finished in 24.4 seconds, beating Sharon Machoka to second place in 25.3 secs while experienced Kadogo came home third in 25.5 secs. William Mbevi bagged the men’s 400m hurdles in 53.0 ahead of Peter Kithome (53.6) while Rono Kipkorir (55.4) came third. Mbevi also won the 110m hurdles in 14.7 while the second place went to Kipkorir Rono in 15.0. In the 400m, Joshua Ndombi emerged winner in 47.6 secs,  beating upcoming Gilbert Nyamao (48.0) and Elkanah Chemelil (48.3) to second and third places respectively. Moses Wasike (10.5 secs) upset Davis Kiviasi (10.6 secs) to win the hotly contested 100 race. Hesbon Ochieng finished third in 10.8 secs. Wasike reigned supreme again, winning the 200m race in 21.7 secs and was trailed by Zablon Ekwam (22.0 secs) and Sammy Tihel (22.2 secs). Duncan Kengere won the men’s 800m in 1:49.2. He was followed by Haron Kemei in second place in 1:49.8 while Francis Leshoo completed the podium finish in 1:50.1. Brian Komen clinched the men's 1,500m in 3:42:1 and was followed by Mathew Kiprop (3:45.7) in second and Robert Biwott (3:46.8) third. After the Mumias event, the action moves to Moi Stadium in Kisumu for the first AK track and field weekend meeting on February 10- 11.
