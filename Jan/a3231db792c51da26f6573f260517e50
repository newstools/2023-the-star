Team Kenya captain Dennis Maara will lead other top amateur golfers at this year’s Magical Kenya Open Golf Championships set for March 9-12 at Muthaiga Golf Club. Limuru Club’s Maara, who led Team Kenya to reclaim the Victoria Cup title and won bronze at Zone V Golf Championships in Addis Ababa, will lead top amateurs during the event. Kenya Golf Union (KGU) named six golfers led by Maara, the 2022 Kenya Match Play Championship winner and Kenya Railways' John Lejirma, who is the 2022 Kenya Amateur Strokeplay Championship winner. They will compete alongside Royal Nairobi's Jay Sandh, who was the runner-up in KAGC, Muthaiga's Njoroge Kibugu, who made the cut in last year's Kenya Open, Muthaiga's Daniel Kiragu, currently the best junior player in the country and Adel Balala of Nyali, the 2022 lowest gross winner. "KGU is excited to announce the six amateur golfers who will be participating in the upcoming Magical Kenya Open to be held from March 9 – 12 at Muthaiga Golf Club," said KGU chairman Njani Ndiritu. "These golfers have worked hard to earn their spots in the tournament and we are confident that they will represent the country with distinction. "The Magical Kenya Open is a great opportunity for these amateurs to showcase their skills on the international stage and we wish them all the best. "This premier event brings together some of the best golfers from around the world, and we are proud to have these talented amateurs representing Kenya," said Ndiritu. ​ "We encourage golf fans across the country to come out and support these talented athletes during the tournament," he added.
