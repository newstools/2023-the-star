After recording their first win of the season, Nairobi City Stars coach Nicholas Muyoti is hoping his side will build on the win in their upcoming matches. City Stars edged Sofapaka 2-1 at the Moi International Sports Centre,  Kasarani on Saturday. Veteran striker Ezekiel Odera and second-half substitute Kisilu were on target for Simba Wa Nairobi while Rody Manga scored for Sofapaka. “We need to build on this performance, our confidence is back. It will be tough against KCB on Wednesday but I am sure we will get a positive result,” said Muyoti. He added: “It's been a long wait but finally we got three points. It was a tough match against Sofapaka, who are a very good side and beat us twice last season.” She further noted that team effort carried the day and thanked players, technical staff, management and fans. Captain Anthony Kimani said: “It was a great win considering we had gone seven matches without victory, but again it's a great motivation to the whole team that anything is possible. We need to keep on pushing." He added: “Great team effort and character brought us three important points.” During the game, forward Mohammed Bajaber made his first start of the season. Bajaber, City Stars’ top scorer in the off-season with five goals, sat out of the first eight games of the season due to an injury.
