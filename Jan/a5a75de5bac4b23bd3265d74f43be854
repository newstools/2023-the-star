Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said that there is nothing that Azimio leader Raila Odinga can do after the anti-Ruto demonstrations. Speaking on Friday during the launch of the Affordable Housing Scheme in Shauri Moyo, Gachagua said that those who claim they do not recognise President William Ruto are dreaming. "If you say that you do not recognise Ruto as the president and after the demonstrations then? From there what next? It ends there," he said. "Those who are claiming that they don't recognise Ruto, that is a dream. They should keep dreaming and when it is over they will find Ruto is the president." Gachagua urged the Azimio brigade to move on because elections are over and Kenyans have already decided on their President. "Even after going to the Supreme Court, they found that there is no case. Wait we meet in the next elections in 2027," he said. On Monday Raila said he does not recognise Ruto as a validly elected president. Raila spoke during a rally at Kamukunji. He affirmed his stance strongly saying the presidential results were rigged. "We do not recognise the Kenya Kwanza administration as a legitimate government and Ruto as the president or any official in his government," Raila said. The opposition chief has called for another rally in Nairobi on Sunday, January 29 at Jacaranda grounds.
