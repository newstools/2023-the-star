A man was on Monday arraigned at a Kibera court for allegedly stealing a passport, an identification card and a driving licence that belonged to a city businessman. Hillary Masika was charged before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa where he denied the charges. The court said the accused person committed the offence on December 24 at Kangemi in Dagoretti Sub-county within Nairobi county. The items which belonged to Boniface Abisiero, the court said were worth Sh1800. The accused person was charged with the second count of handling stolen properties that were believed to have been stolen. He denied having committed the wrongs and requested the court to release him on a lenient bond term. He told the court that he was unable to pay a big amount for cash bail and maintained that he was innocent. The magistrate released him on a cash bail of Sh20,000 with the surety of the same amount. She also directed that the accused person be supplied with all the witness statements and documentary evidence that the prosecution intended to rely on during the entire trial. The case will proceed on February 3 for a pre-trial.
