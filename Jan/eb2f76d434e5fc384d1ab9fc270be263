Kenya Wildlife Service on Monday translocated a calf, sub-adult and mother elephants to Tsavo national park. This is due to the rise of human-wildlife conflict which has increased competition for water and forages outside the park over the few weeks after it rained in the Amboseli ecosystem after a long period of drought in the region. The KWS established a rapid response unit to patrol areas facing human-wildlife conflict. The Problem Animal Management Unit will be working closely with affected communities as part of the elaborate measures taken by KWS to stem human-wildlife conflict and encourage co-existence between wildlife and communities. The PAMU unit has been tasked with continuously monitoring and rapidly responding to emerging conflicts and incidences. The service called on members of the public to report all incidences to the nearest KWS office or through the toll-free number 0800-597-000. The ongoing prolonged drought has worsened the humanâ€“wildlife conflict, especially in the areas near the protected areas, leading to the death of livestock from predation by carnivores.
