Uganda President Yoweri Museveni's son General Muhoozi Kainerugaba has claimed that several Kenyans are afraid of Uganda's army. Muhoozi said Kenyans know that the Ugandan army is greater than that of Kenya. He took to Twitter on Friday claiming that the Ugandan army can capture Nairobi in one week. "Some Kenyans fear us because they know our military is greater than theirs. Our Army can capture Nairobi in 1 week!" he said. This is not the first time President Yoweri Museveni's son has tweeted about capturing Nairobi. In October last year, the General claimed that it would take him, and the Ugandan army less than two weeks to take control of Nairobi. In a series of tweets, Muhoozi made the statement in what many believed to be an apparent show of strength he and his army possess. "It wouldn't take us, my army and me, two weeks to capture Nairobi," he tweeted. Muhoozi later came and termed the remarks that had sparked public debate on Twitter as a joke. He said most people saw the joke in his words but others took it seriously. "Three months ago, I made a 'joke' about taking over Nairobi in two weeks. Now any Tom, Dick or Harry immediately saw it for what it was...'a joke'. But unfortunately for some, it was not. Either way, the truth shall win! The East African Federation shall be realised," he said on Thursday.
