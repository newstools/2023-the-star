Kakamega residents have proposed that the impending county headquarters be located in Mudiri area just opposite the Kakamega GK prison within the municipality. During a public engagement forum on Tuesday, all attendees voted in favour of the location as it was closer and easily accessible by all. This comes even as the county plans to commence construction of Sh.500 million 14-floor county headquarters on the 3-acre piece of land. The County Executive Committee Member for Public Service and County Administration Lawrence Omuhaka lauded residents for attending the forum and presenting their views which he said will be considered before and during the implementation period of the project. Kakamega County has been spending Sh68 million annually as rent for the current county headquarters which is situated in a private building. The construction of the county headquarters will not only save on the humongous rent payments but will also serve as a one-stop shop for all County services and is expected while equally enhance service delivery. The entire work will be financed by the County Pension Fund-CPF, money that is expected to be serviced by the county government in five years. The construction works are expected to last six months with the premises expected to hold all county offices. The County Secretary and Head of Public Service Bonface Okoth noted that the facility will be key in realizing the county governments to the people of Kakamega County. He says the current county headquarters located in the Kakamega CBD has a few office spaces, a situation that has forced other departments to rent private offices. Locals have requested ramps and lifts in the intended offices to enable easy access by people abled differently. While the county government has offered 20 of its engineers to supervise the project, the CPF had promised to ensure top-notch contractors are engaged to ensure high-quality work is attained.
