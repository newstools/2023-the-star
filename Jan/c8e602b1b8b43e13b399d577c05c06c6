The Kenya Premier League has announced a partnership with tech start-up Kasuku to launch a new KPL non-fungible token (NFT) as part of its phase three repositioning stage. KPL joins a growing number of recognised football organisations that have ventured into the NFT marketplace. As the market for football/sports NFT’s evolves, KPL and Kasuku are committed to giving power back to the fans. “We are excited to enter this partnership because of what it represents to the football/sports community. We want to give fans a new way to engage and re-shape the league in Kenya," said Taiwo Atieno, the KPL commercial director. "Our goal is to demystify the metaverse and show our consumers that we have a product that is recorded into block chain, and that is used to certify authenticity and ownership." "Our NFT’s will offer physical utilities, such as owning new football specific stadia, training facilities, in door multi-sport arenas, exclusive content, membership and revenue sharing benefits accessible to the NFT owners." Mowgli Dodhia, CEO and Co-founder Kasuku NFT added: “Kasuku is a direct link to the rest of the digital world and is a great way for KPL to reach a wider audience and generate a new younger generation of fans through a strong digital profile." "Both organisations are Kenyan and this is a great way for local, regional and continental-based companies to make a mark on a digital scale.”
