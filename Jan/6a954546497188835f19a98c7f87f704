Strathmore University Blades have two matches on the card as the Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) resumes weekend. This will be a critical driver for the league that took a month's break during the December holidays. The varsity side face off against former champions Ulinzi Warriors tomorrow in a tight encounter. A win for the Blades will see them push for a top-four finish. They return on Sunday to confront Equity Bank Dumas, another team that is also eyeing their first title after reaching the finals last year. Coach Tony Ochieng is aware of the task ahead and hopes self-belief and determination will be key to his charges' success. Equity Bank Dumas started their training last week and must get off to a strong start in this last leg to boost their post-season finish. In the women's matches, Zetech University Sparks, boosted by having five players named to the provisional national team, play Storms. Storms, who also have Liz Abayo and Celia Makungu knocking on the door of the Kenya team, will have to show class to stop Sparks. Zetech have Christine Akinyi and Ashley Minayo to lead the team whose other fixture includes a match against Africa Nazarene University's Panthers. Struggling Kenyatta University 'Oryx' come face to Strathmore University Swords who will bank on Alexandria Juma and Margaret Ayieko. ANU's Wolfpacks' coach Mike Oluoch had a good run in the first leg but lost some close calls. They face Umoja who stunned the soldiers. The 25 matches planned for this weekend in Nairobi, Mombasa, and Nakuru include lower-division matchups.  Kenya women's team coach George Mayienga will see his United States International University play Strathmore and Footprints. Snipers have a date with Neosasa as Absa also meets Blazers in interesting matchups in the men's category.
