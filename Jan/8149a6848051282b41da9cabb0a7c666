Governor James Orengo has reinstated key officers who were sent on compulsory leave three months ago. The officers include county secretary Joseph Ogutu and chief officers. The acting county secretary Ambassador Richard Owade notified key county officials of the return of their colleagues who had been suspended on October 4 last year. "Joseph Ogutu and Hesborn Mariwa will be deployed to perform specific tasks as and when necessary," Owade's letter reads. Orengo also directed that Owade, who is the County Attorney, continue to serve as the acting county secretary. He directed Walter Okelo to serve as water, sanitation, climate change, environment and natural resources chief officer, Joseph Omondi as governance, administration and ICT chief officer and Dr Samuel Omondi Owino to serve as a chief officer in charge of health. Elizabeth Oduor was directed to serve as sports and tourism chief officer, Charles Siso as chief officer for Lands,Â  James Onyango as chief officer for public works and Henry Ouma for the Education and Youth docket. Jack Odinga, Joshua Onyona and Dr Erick Owino shall work as finance, enterprise and Agriculture chief officers. Owade's letter states that the officers have been reinstated pending the taskforce systems audit and governance reforms report. The report will be released on January 20. While suspending these officers in October last year, Orengo said those were extraordinary yet necessary steps to take, and which had to be taken based on these extraordinary circumstances. He said the compulsory leave is not a disciplinary action but a necessary step to ensure that the audit process yields fruits.
