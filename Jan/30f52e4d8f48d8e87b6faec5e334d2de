Zetech University Sparks coach Maurice Obilo has hailed the inclusion of 11 varsity players to the Kenya Lionesses side. The players are among the provisional squad of 28 named by the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) to start training on Monday ahead of FIBA AfroBasket and All Africa Games Zone Five qualifiers. Obilo pointed out that getting the call-up to the national team was a big achievement and was good for both the varsities and the KBF. “Having many players on the senior national team is a very good thing. It shows the federation is bringing youngsters on board,” Offered Obilo. “It is a good move and will help very much since in two or three years' time, they will easily transition to the team when the seniors call it a day.” Obilo, whose fast-rising Sparks side provided five of the eleven varsity players, is convinced the girls have a strong chance to go all the way. “I don’t know what will happen during training, but these players are good and I am sure if given a chance, they will make it big time,” he said. Zetech University produced point guards Ashley Minayo and Marylisa Omondi. The other three who got the call-up are post-players Vallery Kemunto, Christine Akinyi, and Beryl Aoko. From the University of Nairobi, Dynamites are shooting guards Elizabeth Okumu and Winnie Chebet as well as forward Shalom Gaceri. Alexandra Juma, Joy Mupalia and Margaret Ayieko made the team from Strathmore University Swords. Zetech University, Strathmore University, and the University of Nairobi are the top three varsity sides in the Kenya National Basketball League. The other teams are Kenyatta University and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
