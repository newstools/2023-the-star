Bunyore Starlets head coach Daniel Arunga believes his charges will maintain their standards when they face off against Thika Queens in the Women's Premier League match today at Thika Stadium. Arunga said he hopes his players will put their best foot forward in the mid-week fixture as they seek to secure a result on their travel. “A draw will be a fair outcome for us. This will inspire belief in the girls ahead of the derby against Vihiga Queens at Momboha grounds this weekend," Arunga said. Arunga spoke after a training session at Mumboha. Bunyore have mustered four points from the three matches played thus far. Bunyore scalped Ulinzi in their backyard and drew with Wadadia at Mumias Sports Complex before losing to Kisumu All Starlets at Ebusakami grounds. Arunga added: “I am happy we had a draw with Wadadia as compared to the previous match where we lost 6-1." “After the first season in the league, I believe we have amassed a wealth of experience to compete in our second season." Bunyore faced several challenges in the 2021-22 season including a lack of funds while inexperience proved costly. The team also suffered from a shortage of players. “We have come of age and the training has gone well so far." In another match, four-time WPL champions Vihiga have a date with Kayole Starlets at Camp Toyoyo.
