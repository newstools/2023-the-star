Five girls who topped last year’s KCSE from Algani Girls Secondary school in Kinna, Isiolo county are set to benefit from a scholarship. The five will receive studies in various technical courses abroad. Isiolo Governor Abdi Hassan Guyo said that his administration will support the girls until they complete their courses. The courses include Medicine and Engineering. “The girls did us proud and the best gift we can give our children is a chance to get more education,” he said. All five girls got grades B+ (plus) and above. The county boss was speaking during a meeting at the girls'  secondary school on Monday evening. He was accompanied by Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo, Woman Rep Mumina Gollo, Isiolo South MP Mohamed Tupi, Isiolo North MP Joseph Samal and county assembly speaker Mohamed Roba. Guyo gave his assurance that no single student will fail to report back to school due to lack of fees, even as the prolonged drought situation continues to wipe out their livestock—their main source of livelihood. Isiolo North MP Joseph Samal and his Isiolo South counterpart Mohamed Tubi pledged to sponsor those attending schools within the county, while the county government administration will sponsor those attending schools outside the county. Last month, the governor pledged to set up a Sh50 million bursary kitty to support needy students in partnership with the CDF. "One of my campaign promises was to put education first and in 2023, the bursary kitty will ensure needy students get educated," Guyo said. “My administration aims to close the gap that exists in our human resources by training more of our youths in technical and professional courses like medicine, engineering and law.” The governor also announced that his administration will put aside an entrepreneurship empowerment fund to assist youth and women with start-up capital.
