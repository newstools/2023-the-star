President William Ruto is currently attending dowry negotiations for Nyambura Wambui. Nyambura is the daughter of the Communications Authority of Kenya board chairperson Mary Wambui. She is the second born. A source aware of the negotiations told the Star that it is being held in Nairobi. This is the first dowry negotiation Ruto is attending as a head of state. Businesswoman Mary Wambui is a long-time ally of President Ruto. The president appointed her CA chair in December last year, taking over from Gilbert Kibe who resigned to pursue personal interests. Wambui will serve in the position for a period of three years. "In exercise of the powers conferred by section 6 (1) (a) of the Kenya Information and Communications Act, I, William Ruto, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the Republic of Kenya, appointâ€”Mary Wambui Mungai to be the Chairperson of the Board of Communications Authority of Kenya, for a period of three (3) years, with effect from the 2nd December 2022. The appointment of Gilbert Kibe is revoked," a gazette notice by Ruto read.
