Kenyans on Twitter have reacted to Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja's 'Welcome Back' billboard erected around the city. The billboards have been spotted along Waiyaki Way, Thika Super Highway and Mombasa Road. Sakaja and his deputy Njoroge Muchiri wished Niarobians who are coming back to Nairobi following long Christmas holiday, a prosperous new year. "Welcome back, Prosperous 2023! Let's make Nairobi work," the billboard reads. The move has received both love and hate in equal measures as KOT lamented about the poor state of the city. They said the money used to put up the billboards should have been used elsewhere. Twitter user Murega questioned how much the county spent to erect the billboards. "How much is the county government of Nairobi spending to put up billboards messages welcoming Kenyans back to the city? Ndugu Sakaja Johnson, is this really necessary?" he tweeted. Another by the name Warue said: "And there are streets and roads without signage. How many road signs would that billboard pay for. The city has many streets without lights. Well lit streets and roads would be a better welcome to city dwellers." However, one Agogpiny supported the move saying the rest of the world is doing it. "It's better used there than having it on someone else's pockets. If you travel the world you will know the importance of such. Try Dubai, it's the closest," he tweeted. Twitter user Carol Muga said she sees nothing wrong with the idea as it is refreshing that the leaders are thinking of those who travelled during the festive season. "I see nothing wrong. Asante Johnson Sakaja, it's refreshing to know you and your deputy are thinking about those of us who travelled out of Nairobi. We're back to make Nairobi work," she said.
