East Africa Community CS Rebecca Miano on Wednesday met with US ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman. Miano said they discussed at length the deepening of the partnership between Kenya and the US and the creation of more opportunities for the two countries to connect. "We deliberated on the support of regional integration, sustainable drought management and exploring the full potential of Regional Development Authorities." CS Miano said collaboration between the EAC affairs Ministry and the US Embassy is key to making the region more secure and prosperous. The CS also appraised the Ambassador on the drought situation in Kenya, interventions that are in place to alleviate the situation and the potential of Regional Development Authorities to be the key development vehicles for Kenya.
