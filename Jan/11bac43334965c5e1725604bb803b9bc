Kisumu All Stars chief executive officer, Nicholas Ochieng has made a passionate appeal for financial support to enable them to honour their upcoming fixture in Mombasa. The FKF National Super League team is expected to play Mombasa Elite on Saturday at Mbaraki Sports Club in their eighth game of the season. However, Ochieng on Thursday said the team is in danger of dishing out a walkover due to a lack of funds. He said the team has been struggling financially and has not paid players and the technical bench since September. “The boys have been given a target to get a promotion this season but this can't be achieved if they give walkovers. To make their intention clear, the playing units, coaching staff and the CEO have raised among themselves 30,000 for the Mombasa trip but this is a drop in the ocean. We request to our leaders in Kisumu county and well-wishers to chip in and help the team travel,” pleaded Ochieng. He added: “This is a polite request to friends of Kisumu All Stars and well-wishers  to help us honour our match in Mombasa on Saturday.” The club is in the meantime looking for partners and is open for talks to save the team from relegation, said Ochieng. The club is 10th on the log with nine points having won two games, drawn three and lost one. Last weekend, they were awarded a walkover after SS Assad failed to show up at Moi Stadium in Kisumu.
