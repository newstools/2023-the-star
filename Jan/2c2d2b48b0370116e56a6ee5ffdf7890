A Ngong police officer, who spent days at Kenyatta National Hospital’s ICU after stabbing himself three times on Thursday, is out of danger. The Ngong North subcounty police commander, Abduba Hussein, told the Star on Tuesday that the officer has been moved out from the High Dependency Unit to the general ward. Hussein dismissed claims that the officer caused trouble at the Ngong police station OB office on Thursday. “What happened is that the officer appeared to have been stressed because for several days he kept to himself. He was not talking to his colleagues,” the police commandant said. Hussein said the officer locked himself in his house and stabbed himself three times with a kitchen knife in the neck and stomach. “His neighbours, who are also police officers rushed to rescue him after hearing commotions from his house, they later rushed him to KNH,” Hussein said. Hussein said it has been established that most officers take loans from microfinance houses that exceed their income. “Most of them at the end of the month, sometimes take nill salary because of overborrowing. In such situations, you will find them resorting to heavy drinking with the hope that beer will drown their problems,” Hussein said. He said most officers in the force require counselling and should even be trained on the management of their financial resources like salary.
