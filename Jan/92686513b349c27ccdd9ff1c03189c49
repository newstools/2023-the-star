Kisumu County is ready to host the ninth edition of the Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association (Kicosca) as from January 15 to 21. Kicosca secretary general Humphrey Kangea said all is set for the annual extravaganza. “All preparations are done. We are just waiting for the games to start on January 15,” he told the Star on phone. More than 35 counties are expected to participate in the seven-day event, said Kangea. The counties will battle it out in football, handball, basketball, netball, squash, badminton, tug of war, scrabble, netball, chess, volleyball, pool, ajua, golf, table tennis and darts. There will also be a cultural dance and choir competition. The venues include Moi Stadium, Kisumu Day, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Sports Complex, Cosmopolitana Club, Aga Khan Hall, Kisumu National Polytechnic, Joventures Hotel, Dubai Complex, Nyanza Golf Club and Grace Onyango Social Hall. On the opening day, hosts Kisumu will start their campaign for the football title against Nyandarua. There will also be three tug of war duels pitting Kakamega against Kiambu in the women’s category. Nairobi will test their mettle against Nakuru while Kisumu and Bungoma will contest for a foothold. In the last edition held in Embu, Nairobi emerged the overall winners ahead of Kisumu and Uasin Gishu. In November last year, Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire, the outgoing Kicosca patron handed over the chain, a symbol of authority and power to undertake the roles of a patron to Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o. The games were previously known as Kenya Inter-Municipal Sports and Cultural Association (KIMSCA) and were organised by the defunct local authorities. At the same time, Busia County has vowed to claim the football title. The team has intensified preparations for the games and has already played two build up matches, losing to neigbours Kakamega 2-1 in the opening game and beating Mumias Veterans 5-1. Busia lost to Bungoma in last year's edition of the Kicosca games.
