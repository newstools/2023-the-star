DR Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi has accused Rwanda of being the source of instability in the region, in a sharp response to comments made by a Rwandan cabinet minister, Claire Akamanzi, at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Sorry madam, the insecurity issue we have in the Great Lakes region is called Rwanda," he said. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes because of conflict in eastern DR Congo Mr Tshisekedi also said the M23 has not been respecting a peace accord, which required the rebels to immediately withdrawal from areas they had captured. “M23 is still there, they act like they are moving but they are not, they’re simply moving around and redeploying elsewhere, and they stay in the towns that they have captured,” he said. Speaking at a WEF session on Tuesday, Mrs Akamanzi told Mr Tshisekedi that “if security is indeed a big problem for you, and clearly if you were able to solve it as DRC government or DRC army, you would have done it by now”. “I believe the solution is in your hands to own the problem but [also] to work with those who can solve it... because security is paramount for investment,” Mrs Akamanzi added.
