The drowning of three University of Nairobi students in Budalangâ€™i is tragic. It should not have happened. But points to a bigger problem of lack of regulations and strict enforcement of rules to ensure passenger safety on boats. The boat they were traveling in capsized with 10 on board. Seven were rescued and treated. According to the police, the boat was overloaded and when one person stood up to take a picture, it tilted and capsized. This points to negligence. It brings to mind the words of safety and motivational speaker Kina Repp who said that you are your last line of defense in safety. It boils down to you. This statement is true but most times, we tend to drop the ball when it comes to our own safety. It is important that we start caring about our own safety and demand for safety gears when boarding a boat. Passengers should also not board an overloaded boat. The government should move in and ensure boats are equipped with life jackets or personal flotation devices, throwable flotation devices, fire extinguishers, visual distress signals, sound signaling devices and first-aid kits are available for every person on board.
